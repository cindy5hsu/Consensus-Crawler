 all right hi everyone welcome to our stage my name is Julian Kwan I'm co-founder and CEO of two licensed real-world asset token platforms InvestorX out of Singapore and IXS out of the Bahamas today we're going to talk about yield and what has happened in the history of digital assets there's a whole bunch of different kind of things to explore I think just quickly before I let the guys introduce when we think about I think yield in the space of digital assets and crypto over the years it's predominantly been a lot of you know stake token a and get rewards back in token a and a lot of crypto to crypto the next evolution here is the real asset tokens which are essentially you know tokenized treasuries tokenized money market funds etc most of them are securities but then they're they're paying off sort of interest rates and whatnot so I think there's been a lot of different evolutions and today we're going to ask a couple of the experts over here what they've seen try and give you guys a quick very quick six years in in 20 minutes and then hopefully some time for some questions so Melvin do you want to quickly introduce yourself and QCP thanks thanks Julian afternoon everyone my name is Melvin I'm the CEO of QCP QCP is the leading digital asset partner in Asia and what we've been always doing is really helping to put digital assets on balance sheets whether it's a corporate an investor on individual what we've done in the recent times is that we were the first designated market maker for Beudel which is the BlackRock tokenized money market fund and we believe that this is the future of finance thanks for having me and Lazo welcome yeah thanks for having me Julian so I'm Lazo Sabo the co-founder and CEO of Kiln and Kiln we are the leading also leading company on-chain rewards platform which means we offer staking and DeFi to a lot of institutions in the space exchanges custodians wallet new banks asset managers and we have more than 13 billion assets are yielding today so thank you very much for having me yeah so why don't we jump in so maybe you guys could share your thoughts on what yield products in the digital assets space have you seen you know kind of a summary over the years bit of an evolution what failed what succeeded and give the the audience a bit more color around that I'll start first and I think many of many of us us who are in in this sector for a while now would be a quite happy it's the 19th of February so 18th of February had a lot of significance for many who are returning money who will return money from the FTX and that was actually the first version of yield if you remember they were saying that if you left if you kind of staked or left it with me you'll be yielding but that was a very traditional credit product that didn't work out very well and I think what we're seeing as we evolve as we've seen tokenized money market fund staking as a product I think these are coming through as what we deem as a yield that came from where you understand the economic activity that you're doing I think fundamentally to to all the things that we do it's important to understand the underlying business the underlying use of of the funds and I think we're coming to that phase and it's great it's great to to see this this evolution yeah and on our perspective at kiln we focus very much on on-chain yields so on-chain yield for us started with staking staking you know us for the ones without that don't know what staking is is you locked your your native assets on proof of stake blockchain to validate transaction and in exchange get some rewards from the inflation and and the network fees of the protocol you validate so if there and Solana are sticking protocols and you can stick your a thermon Solana again rewards in return so 2018 2020 it was pretty much of a retail sticking approach where you would invest in ICO and in stake to your favorite validator 2020 and onwards you would start to stay from your favorite platform the exchanges though it was still very complex for exchanges to up to our first taking that's why they would prefer to offer centralized lending and Genesis and and the FTX events kind of collapsed a big part of this model and then since then we've seen DeFi for sure in in 2020 2021 emerging with liquid staking lending boring and the last year new forms of yields first one is restaking which is you know a narrative that we we can talk about it which is essentially a structured product on on on your state assets and the second one for me on top of our degrees that we're going to talk about our fixed rates you and as the market get more and more institutionalized you know investors users would like to have more predictive predictability in the yields and more have more fixed rates yeah so we've seen some pretty incredible blow-ups and failures in the space over the last couple of years maybe you guys could answer the question like what were a lot of those problems and have they been solved and the new products that are coming out like what's the difference today 2025 I think I think the the biggest difference between the products then and now is that the products are being sold now on real proper use cases I think there were too many narratives and if you thought about how the way the products are being marketed and discussed the channels I think that's that's materially changed and that reflects maturity in the in the ecosystem I think what we're seeing is that you're not going to have lots of people trying to use discord and twitter to just drive emotions into into what we deem as a yield or product so I think that that for me is a big big difference what hasn't really worked in the past has been you know what we say like you said right stake something your your returns in something else and you're just selling yeah it's the same token something else or you're liquidating and you're saying oh you're saying oh my returns is 30 percent because that token went to the moon I think that's not proper risk and reward and I think that that's actually a liquidity game so that's not real yield if you would ask me it's who's the last one out of that building so what we're seeing now I think is really changed I think investors and people involved should always ask this very fundamental question right where is it coming from for those that are new to the space that the old school model was launch an ICO and then the platform try to tie up the tokens and reduce the liquidity to drive the price so you'd stake the token a and you get the rewards in token a and it goes great when things are going up and then it's a house of cards when things are going down yeah yeah yeah yeah I think the FTX collapse in 2022 show that a lot of the exchanges would offer centralized lending as yields right you would have Bitcoin you would have a theorem would have Solana we offer you from five to 10% and in the background five to ten percent and in the background it was you know genesis taking your money and lending it to to other companies such as ftx or lamina we've seen the limit of that because it's quite it was quite opaque how the money was managed how the risk was managed what was the counterpart it could be risky crypto companies in that sense and the reason you wouldn't see the safest yield in crypto which is taking is because even in 2022 it was still very much complex for an exchange or wallet or custodians to offer staking to their users i think we've kind of fixed this problem now um on most of the your favorite exchange most of your favorite wallets if you're an institution using you know you're a qualified custodian or a custody solution you can access staking easily um via api with the right reporting uh and companies like us are providing this now what needs to be fixed is on and by the way if you look at stakeable assets 50 of these assets are staked so it's it's already a very mature market if you have soul if you are eat there's already high chances you're already staking them on a low risk basis but then what's still missing is the uh i would say the defy yields or other bs if you're a stable coin you have only seven percent chances to yield them uh so it's it's still a very mature market because on most of these platforms these stable coin yields usdc usdt other stable coins um are not available securely uh you know in a simple manner there's too many choices so i think it feels that through different yield sources boring lending hardware raise uh this will be the the next two or three years problem that will need to be fixed um you know accessing stable coin yields more easily if you're via your favorite platform yeah that's a good point so and most of the stable coins are uh at least if we just focus on the big ones usdt usdc they're paying no uh then no yields about two three years ago we were looking at our platforms how do we make uh real asset tokens not usdc if they see i'm talking about a tokenized treasury or tokenized share of a company make it more usable where could you stake it and earn those rewards and it had never really been done before i found the only thing i could find online was a one-page research paper that was actually launched by copper the custody company when i tracked it all the way down it was a guy living on mykonos who just came up with ideas and they weren't actually doing it but the point of the story was he said we've got to get to a point where this whole yield is not just crypto and we've got to add real asset tokens and then we'll see this huge explosion of growth so you just touched on it then but back back study at melbourne lake what what what are you seeing now that is now coming we're seeing on chain wise at least the real asset tokens that have found product market fit most of the wall street assets uh but there's a lot of stuff going on private credit private debt real estate what what do you think is is changing now related to yield and bringing you know real crypto tokens with real world asset tokens and how that's going to unfold because that that's just this enormous uh growth industry that's like a day two yeah you know i think for for most of us sitting you know and thinking about real world assets and and tokenization what does it really mean for me uh as an asset holder um i think what we're not understood is the power of the liquidity value of having that token in your ownership and what does that mean for example today if you buy a share the share is not in your wallet it's being held somewhere else but it's being provided to the rest of the market as liquidity for return and i think tokenization and bringing real world assets onto that actually returns that economic return of providing liquidity uh to the market back to the market back to the owner of the holder and it's similar to what kiln is doing in terms of staking you're staking your ease to support a network you could be staking your your apple token into the network to support the the liquidity of it and the economic return actually goes back to you that's what i think is going to be the future what's changed is that now the the the liquidity has changed why we started to use property as the first thing to try let's put rwa wine these are not liquid enough but with the tokenized money market fund that we've done with uh with black rock this is now we're talking about scale and we're talking about people who are willing to to hold on to it who's going to have a bit bigger portion and then we start to build products on top of it we try to give the uh you know you give you give the return back to the the holder of the asset so i think that's going to be the the proliferation that we're going to see yeah i think um it's funny to see the the comparison between staking and defi and real world assets because uh staking was a fairly easy problem to solve for the end user you had if you have if you have sold you can earn three percent on if you can earn 10 percent on so um there's not that many options when you have usdc or usdt what where do you put your money do you put your money on ave on compound on morfo on on though t-bills tokenized um do you put your your money on arbitrum on optimism on ethereum that even on these three d5 protocols in three different chains might have three different different yields so there's many many many more opportunities and uh yields and rewards differences so i guess what needs to be fixed is just um abstraction if you have um usdc you are on your favorite exchanges wallet uh custodian and we offering you a five to ten percent uh rewards opportunity four point five percent because if the boring lending yields are below the t-bills then you know you're gonna you're gonna touch a t-bill and higher if if you go on your favorite uh oh sorry on on the blue chip boring lending protocols that might offer you higher yields during bear markets because sorry bull market because you're in bull market usually boring and lending yields are higher than t-bills so i think abstraction and reporting is the first first problem to solve the other problem to solve is volatility rates um on in d5 yields you sometimes have um a yield that is at five percent one day and it's going to be at 15 percent the other day so this this very unpredictable way of getting rewards uh in d5 is um not reassuring for 99 of the users or 99 of the institutions so i think what we'll you'll see emerging is uh actually you know um anchoring in a four or five or ten percent yield over 12 months and and then in the background it will use real world assets or you will use more uh d5 yields uh combined right but there will be a complete abstraction one or three choices to the end user because today you have 20 or 30 different choices you don't know exactly what to choose yeah so a lot of terminology in in crypto is is either a similar or different word but basically just naming a service that we use in financial markets right tradfi so i just wanted to get your opinions on you know real world asset um tokens this whole new use case for yield generation whether it's real estate or treasuries uh we've got larry fink wall street coming in we've got ondo uh coming from the defy side we've got blackrock coming from the the tradfi side like where who do you think is going to win this what do you think is going to go on there you're probably going to say blackrock yeah that's a tough one just i actually i actually i actually think um and i was a long believer of this uh people used to say well there was a time that crypto was going to buy over the banks uh right back back in the 20 21 but i think it was always the coming together of the two worlds uh and and i think we're seeing it um um what tokenization as a concept brings forward and how it discounts the future is that it is going to increase the ability of the individual to raise liquidity for very illiquid assets how if today you're holding on to your property you're getting a mortgage that's your liquidity but if you could start saying i've got my house in the tokenized way i've put it up for into a staking kind of a situation that's going to change the world so and that would need both the traditional side of finance to provide the liquidity and the digital side to provide the infrastructure i don't know it's a question for you i i really don't have the answer who will be the winners of real world assets issuance tomorrow is it the blackrock infinity of the world or will you have much more decentralized uh you know issuance um i guess julian you you're very familiar with this uh ecosystem having an issuance platform yourself so what do you think blackrock fidelity or newcomers yeah so we've got a situation where the the real product market fit in rwa is back at wall street we've gone all the way back and that's come about because crypto is so volatile where do people earn yield sitting on stable coins uh well they started buying tokenized treasuries uh that were on chain uh the banks were talking about this for many years doing their own private chain you know no one really cared there were a couple of private chain protocols they failed um it had to go on public chain and now larry thinks talking about that's the only way forward so but the point is that we always saw this convergence where the the trad fi guys would start selling crypto they would start tokenizing rwa for efficiency because they're closed wall banks and gardens they don't they're not going to touch the defy guys but if they can save money which they can there's a lot of studies out there now um by using tokens versus paper they do it so they've been doing that now conversely the defy guys were always going to come for the rwa you saw this in 2021 ftx binance bitfinex they launched tokenized stocks which are rwa they just didn't do it with guys like us so they had no licenses so they pulled them down now we're having that 2.0 moment uh coinbase is out in abu dhabi building an rwa exchange that's probably more because of the sec problems but you'll probably see them come out in the us later this year with rwa crypto.com has been buying broker dealers around the world so they're going to add rwa to the tokens and you know we've just partnered up with uh with the super app in japan line it's a fintech messaging app 200 million users and we're the rwa partner so so they're adding more products right um and on the other side as well you've got um you you could see that these the crypto exchanges who are who are selling digital tokens bitcoin ethereum altcoins stable coins we're always going to want to sell more things just once they've got these big audiences so another thing we've done recently partnered with four uh crypto exchanges in southeast asia the 25 million users can buy reward asset tokens because the crypto guys don't have the licenses but the takeaway is that trad fi has been coming full speed uh towards the space and and and defies as well so i think ultimately yeah you're going to start seeing more coinbase versus you know jp morgan as the fight versus too much but but either way that there's there's a lot of different assets out there that there's a technical problem with trad fi the australian stock exchange tried to build their own rwa exchange failed new york stock exchange tried to do the thing failed hundreds of minutes there's too many middlemen in the way getting paid and they do not want to get out of the way so you basically have to start a brand new system which is sort of where we're involved but um there's a lot to talk about there but we'll keep going um so this isn't financial advice of course but like from a practical perspective maybe you guys can give some um ideas to everyone here about like yield like where where do you get yield for stable coins now what are some of the platform names like what are some of the products out there and try to give a bit more color to that yeah i well our business isn't really um derivatives and that's where where our strong suits are and our thesis is very simple um when we were looking at credit um you were you were lending to outright unsecured to to an exchange for four percent uh my question back is why don't you monetize the volatility of this token that everyone's so scared of and if you think about that if if you're looking at monetization of volatility your returns are north of ten percent easily depending on your risk appetite um another simple way to get yield is to understand that see the market structures um so one of the things that we did with with uh with budo was really using it as as underlying to create to take advantage of some of these basis trades that we've been hearing so much about so i think these are simple ways uh from from a more market structure style uh you know to to get to get yield that you understand what you're trying to monetize yeah i mean our um mission is is now to make sure you get access to boring lending yields when you have usdc usdt or your favorite stable coin um from your favorite platform your exchange custodians wallets um and that's on you know ave compound more for many other boring lending protocols but these are the the three main ones for example and um as people want to leverage in bull market you get interesting yields uh from five to to fifteen percent uh for the for the for the highest and and riskest one and uh you already see that most of these pairs are backed by rwas i think next year you will see the the rwas and the t bills rates a bit all uh leading the the path but but not only uh being the default yields uh as you know these boring lending yields will go down and um and early ways will will be the primary um um strategy that that you might uh access to again from your favorite dashboard from your favorite uh platform um that's coming so i think uh you know related to rwa like what what is uh what we've been kind of seeing what's interesting as well which i mean a lot of people here probably live in you know new york singapore hong kong developed markets easy to buy uh financial instruments uh that's certainly not the case in the majority of the world um vietnam indonesia whatever countries in in latam a lot of these buyers can't get it so um i was just looking at mr over there waving his uh his hat i uh anyway so the point is that there's a lot of different use cases so when you start to see you start to hear about these these assets like when people started tokenizing treasuries people like what's the point you can buy them on wall street and it was like well there's 200 billion dollars of stable coins earning no yield we'll tether and circle are making the money let's give them a product so i guess almost coming up to sort of one of the last questions like what what do you guys think instead of the biggest opportunities that's that's rolling out like related to yield related to rwa you guys are deep in the space like what are your sort of almost predictions for this year that you think are going to be uh the big stories i think one of the biggest stories this year should would be really uh people understanding that yield can come from good good products like staking good products like uh you know a money market fund but i think uh what's really missing and what most of us are uh too too distracted by because there are too many tokens in this uh in this in this universe to even understand is that actually if you look at the simple things such as bitcoin ethereum solana there is a lot of uh room for you to monetize the volatility and add that to part of the portfolio i think and wait for more stable developments with regards to what real world assets is coming and because it is coming and then deploy your capital in in that in the risk adjusted way yep i mean i agree on the volatility part i think ethena is a very good example of you know uh interesting basis trade uh yields that was um flowing most of defy last year uh and still continuing to a fewer extents and i think this year we'll see i mean you know the biggest product market fit in crypto is stablecoin these days um you know latam africa southeast asia um people want to access digital dollar uh and now with a kind of abstraction passkey wallets that can be completely abstracted from from millions of users my mother and my grandmother um once you access digital dollar you access a yield in the background is it tb yields that it's completely embedded it's actually a same token that is yielding is it more basis trade uh yields that give you maybe a higher yields than the 4.5 percent up to 10 or 15 percent uh you will see much more access to that to hundreds of millions of users that wouldn't have access to uh finance and digital dollar before and i think this is what it's coming this year um even more in you know in a um accelerated manner than last year and that's very exciting yeah i that before they closed down busd and rich tier is a friend of mine so that was very disappointing three of the top six cryptos of us dollar stable coins uh about a year ago i had a chat with chris perkins as the president of coin fund it's one of the og crypto funds in the us it'd been lobbying most a group of them lobbying us and i asked him what was the one the one thing that you think or know that no one else really knows so well the one thing is that there's been bipartisan understanding in america this guy like 12 months ago that stable coins increase us dollar dominance which is what they thought they were losing the bitcoin so they're going to like let that roll to your point these us dollar stable coins now which are the only current fiat currency that really exists in the stable coin world is going to proliferate and it's going to grow and as you said if you can get your hands on it's much easier for someone in an emerging market to get a stable coin than it is to get a real dollar um so that's quite interesting um we've got one one minute left you guys have shared a lot of your experience and really appreciate that i'll give you 20 30 seconds to tell us a little bit the last closing comments on what what's in store for qcp this year and and what would you like the audience to take away from today i think i mean for us at qcp we're focused on building out a regulated business and we think that derivatives is the future uh with where you can get yield uh on top of what's existing today and i think as the markets develop we're going to see quite a fair bit of this so i hope you guys start reading up on that bit yeah laza yeah we're pretty much focused on on staking the past four to three three to four years um making staking yields access to most of your favorite platform and we kind of uh you know succeed that uh now it's a um massively adopted product and we are one of the largest not the largest company in that space and i think the the next one is definitely making uh simcoin yields accessible to hundreds of millions of users and and that will be um and that will go much beyond staking we call it the saving account for the world and we'll try to make it happen yeah yeah so i think my last comments is if you want to get uh more knowledge around yield rwa etc the only way to do it is to get started you sign up on platforms you access the newsletters you put some money to work so you actually get your fingers dirty you'll probably get have a bit of anyone who's been in crypto that was the whole journey as well and encourage you to to check out their platforms and thank you very much for your time today
