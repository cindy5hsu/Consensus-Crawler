 Hi, welcome to this fireside chat with Robinhood crypto and Solana is retail moving on chain and we've got some powerhouses in the crypto industry with us we've got Lily Liu who's the president of the Solana Foundation as well as Johan Kerbrat he's the vice president and general manager of Robinhood crypto so let's get into it Solana hit a market cap of a hundred and twenty five billion dollars per coin market cap data sixth largest crypto in the market cap all-time high of two hundred ninety five dollars last month per coin desk com data what did Solana do right because I'd say in 2022 everyone was pretty pessimistic about Solana but like a phoenix you've the the change the words in and I'd say a lot of it is attributed to you Lily actually and so your support of all the projects so tell me what what went right I'm not sure I would say that I think that you know look we as the foundation because we're basically a human interface for a github repo is really what it is really we've always wanted to have the best tech and also be the best place for developers and I do remember a little bit something happening in 2022 then or 2022 something I have some brief so some recollection of that but you know it might have looked I if a lot of people looked at that from the outside and thought well that's certain death event right yeah at best sort of semi live roadkill but from the inside of the ecosystem nothing really changed right people were building the day before the day during the day after that's always been the approach that we've taken and even a number of us were pretty excited about the opportunities that lie ahead on the ability to really build something in the ecosystem from you know what was a little bit of reset point so you're being humble Lily because like you say that but I'd say in the ethereum community right now they're having some leadership doubts and that that's not happening on the Solana side so I mean what is it that what's the secret sauce that's happening in the Solana community that is just ignite this fire I mean I can't speak to ethereum I don't spend any time in the ethereum ecosystem I have a lot of good friends just from having been in this ecosystem for a long time really I spend all of my time in the Solana ecosystem and so I can only speak to kind of the way we think about it we think about ourselves as we're infrastructure for developers to build applications and products that delight users that's what we're here to do that's what we're focused on so that means we're focused on trying to have the coolest tech to support the coolest products and the best developers and also now to really be the best place for capital right in my mind that's what crypto has always been about it's always been about blockchains as global shared financial infrastructure and so we've always just been laser focused on that and I think actually what we think about more frequently is how do we compare against trad fi exchanges right how do we as an ecosystem compare against the traditional financial ecosystem in terms of trading volume in terms of asset access and that's I think really as an industry what we need to be look looking towards instead of you know instead of just sort of what's just happening within the within the industry itself let's turn over to Robin Hood you guys just reported Q4 earnings in 2024 total net revenues increased 58% year over year to almost three billion dollars three three hundred fifty eight million of that was in crypto transaction revenue its highest contribution from digital assets so far JP Morgan city Bernstein all raise their price targets for Robin Hood so congratulations you guys explain what Robin Hood crypto is and why is it succeeding over all the other trading platforms out there what is it doing right well you know I think there's a few things that we've been focusing on one is to give access to everybody cryptocurrencies you know at the lowest cost in average and also in a very easy and simple ways to use but I think one of the big advantage of Robin Hood is being able to go from traditional assets to digital assets in a very simple way and so you know I think overall we've we had a lot of advantages from the fact that we have traditional finance and digital assets the second aspect I think is really going to be around like the education that we put in place on our systems we you know we have million of customers a lot of them are new to crypto and so we have a lot of responsibility to make sure that they can interface with digital asset in a safe way I suppose this is a question for both of you but how are you exciting retail to get on your platforms to get on the Solana protocol and whatnot what what is the secret there and what advice can you offer to folks who want to do the same in whatever projects or communities they're trying to develop yes so we have two things and I can start and then you can follow but we have two things we have a Robin wallet where we actually support Solana and you know you can access like the thousands of new tokens and application that are based on Solana and the second thing that we have is called Robin connect which is a on-ramp and off-ramp that is integrated with a lot of Solana wallets including phantom including moonshot and so for us like that's one of the the manual recommendation that we have if you can create a good onboarding if you can create a good way to find your wallet you will have a lot more success and then you as our competitor yeah so I think there's got to be something unique that you can do that you can't do anywhere else in order to get people over the the hump of you know frankly creating a wallet on saving your passphrase a number of those different things are are unique and so to make it worthwhile for people to kind of go through that onboarding experience and also that learning experience has got to be something really worth doing on the other on the other end and 15 16 years into crypto that has always been some form of speculation right I think that is going to change as as the infrastructure for example like the Solana enables a broader range of economic activity to to happen on chain but I think you know therefore whenever you have new technologies you have to think about what experiences can this technology provide that are 10x better that are 10x better what you can get in this case with your bank with your payment app with your brokerage account or something like that and and so I think that up until now it's been on the accessibility of these new types of assets to basically anyone that has an internet connection and yes there's an aspect of that which is speculative those people like to speculate and that is one use case of money but I think that will eventually broaden into a much broader global financial ecosystem where it's not just sort of buy this thing and hope it goes up but it will be actually you know there's new ways that I can pay save invest all in the same place it's great you bring up speculation because right now in the news cycle we're hearing a lot from this Libra token that the president of Argentina was tweeting about it exploded to four and a half billion in market cap and then it lost its value 90 90 90 to 5 percent within the same day it was a rug pull that a lot of people were hurt on it and the same could be said by the the line a token Trump token before that now it created this huge buzz and excitement in the industry but it has a lot of people concerned about the speculative value of it the extractive value in terms of people getting hurt so yeah I would love to hear your thoughts on the whole phenomenon I don't think there's anyone who thinks that's a good situation right I don't think there's anyone who thinks that's a desirable situation one that should be repeated I think that because we've been our industry has been an environment where financial innovation on more real products has been disallowed practically speaking because of the lack of regulatory clarity right because of the continued desire to make crypto fit into existing regulatory structures rather than to reimagine how regulatory structures should should fit this new technology in order to encourage good behavior and good innovation what that has done is it's pushed a lot of actors to declare upfront you know I'm not doing anything which is financial it has no value and so do as you will and that actually attracts a certain type of people who are more interested in sort of extreme speculation rather than financial innovation and so I think this is a kind of second-order impact of there not being a more productive way to create new structure products right because every time someone has tried for example to innovate on a on-chain price discovery mechanism right on a launch pad they've actually been sued for it for millions of dollars and two years of your life and so what we have here now is you take all of that speculative energy and it goes into the most extreme form of speculation and people do bad things with that yeah it's a completely unregulated mean coin casino it's expect incredible to see from your end in Robin Hood when you're deciding to onboard these tokens because we had a previous conversation where we talked about how Robin Hood is has just onboarded Pepe as well as Cardano and other tokens so what's the process of onboarding and in deciding you know when to allow for these tokens to be accessible to your retail users yeah so you know we have a bit more of a selective process we only have 22 assets on the platform and so for us a lot of the discussion that we have with our listing processes around the security of the asset can we offer it safely to our customer can we have the right liquidity and pricing and so you know I think at the end of the day what we see a lot in the discussion is around about the the meme coins but what we forget is all the the usage that we see on the other assets so for example we we have a lot of people buying ethereum or Solana and transferring into their wallet and doing a lot of things with it but you know I think it's just one phase of the iceberg when we are talking about this meme coin you know we can see with stable point for example the strong adoption from institution from company like like cause we are using stable to transfer between market makers and us 24 7 on weekends when you know banking rails actually do not support this kind of use case so you know I think it's always going to be like very exciting to talk about the latest meme coin but we cannot actually see a lot of usage of the real technology behind it Lily I wonder where you see meme coins headed and how it can be turned into something more valuable and sustainable I don't know if you heard Hayden Davis the market maker for the Libra token but in an interview that he did on YouTube he was trying to figure out well how do you make this market sustainable and his thoughts were well I'm gonna just snipe the token and maybe at some point inject the money back in and maybe it'll prop up the market and it'll help out with other ecosystems but I mean it was insane but I mean from your perspective yeah how do you make it sustainable well I think about it less so how do you make meme coin sustainable but I think about it more in terms of how should we taking it away from meme coins how do we with internet capital markets use the power sort of broad distribution and 24 7 liquidity with potentially up to five and a half billion people on the internet to create more transparent fair price discovery mechanisms right and there's actually a lot of literature on this on how do you do Dutch auctions right there's potentially people experimented this in the past in 2022 where you could go through various rounds of of narrowing price discovery having a 24-hour period where where people provide liquidity into bonding curve there's all sorts of vectors and people have tried but people stopped trying it because it was largely seen as something that would be dangerous right to do from regulatory perspective so I think if there were a way that we could start to start to innovate on those let's call a price discovery mechanisms on the open financial internet then I think you would potentially get to a place where between you know the creative uses funding curves governance systems you could discourage and and practically sort of eliminate some of the sniping insider activity that I think is even if people make the legal argument that it's unregulated and therefore legal but it's still bad for markets and bad for part of market participants bad for a product bad for a community at the very least right arguably pretty immoral as well so I think that really in times like these I think it's really an argument for more open innovation rather than just shutting everything down interesting all right now we're in Hong Kong and Robin Hood has announced that they are expanding into Asia maybe you can tell us a bit about those plans how you're finding navigating the Asian market compared to America yeah it's it's a really different market obviously and so for us we did announce that we will expand in Singapore and use Singapore as the headquarter for Asian expansion I think for for us what we've been excited about with with Singapore has been like there's a clear regulatory framework there was a regulator the mass is actually very upfront about it we've also contributed to the USD G which is a stable coin that is regulated by mass and so you know we think that there is a lot to do there we think that there is a lot of to disrupt as well you know a lot of the previous participants have been still acting with that full I will say procedure and so we think that we can actually come in as a big regulated company and embrace the market and Lily was talking a bit about more transparency building trust in the space and I wonder when it comes to decentralized finance and well Robin Hood mainly deals with centralized finance up do you see any pathways to defy yeah absolutely we we think actually a lot of our customer are using Robin does an on-ramp to defy and then they use our self custody wallet all other wallets to actually do a lot more in the in the defy space but Robin Hood itself we we are at the cross paths between traditional finance and crypto and web3 and we actually think we can do a lot into the tokenization space so we've been pretty vocal about the fact that we are investing a lot in it and we think that you know in the near future we can play a major role in this in this space how do you envision that future will finance become decentralized eventually or it will continue to exist in the centralized experience the or something in between I think there is a right you know balance between the two like I think a bit of regulation is not a problem you know like when you look at things like FTX and the custody issues that there was at the time if we had like very simple regulation around how to mix customer funding from funds like we could have avoided this world crisis so you know I don't think that necessary regulation is is bad but I also think the technology from blockchain can help traditional finance last year we celebrated the settlement in T plus one which is you know pretty insane in crypto like a one day settlement that's a lot of like this states it would be like 10 minutes at max in the in a Bitcoin world and so you know we think that we can actually use a blockchain technology to revolutionize the old financial system all right in 2025 Lily where do you see the biggest trends in the Solana community headed what innovations would you use in the local community where you are going to be doing in the you predict would pick up well we like to joke about how we want to make boring exciting again and so that means things like stable coins right oh well everyone's into stable coins these days but actually previously sounded like a really boring thing but I think stable coins are really exciting I because stable coins is actually quite a lot of differentiation between stable coins but they have in common is they are ultimately the base asset for payments for trading for basically all financial transactions and so I think that you know that is kind of the entry point of bringing existing financial systems whether retail institutional businesses into the on-chain economy and so that's you know something I I spend all day thinking about and you know for us we really think about blockchains as being infrastructure for internet capital markets and what that means is you want the full range of assets being represented on chain in the same way that when you're on the internet there's all sorts of content out there whether you like it or not and that is selected filtered produced whatever at the application layer we as L1 we're kind of more akin to what's called the ccpip right http and then we want to be infrastructure to support applications to build products that are unique and serve their users best and so for example you know we want to be the type of infrastructure that would support the business aspirations of for example Robin Hood and many other financial applications that we don't even know exist today might not even consider to be financial applications today so that is to me like stable coins is really jumping off point for many of those things so we're here to make boring exciting again right let's make money great again Lily Johan thank you so much
