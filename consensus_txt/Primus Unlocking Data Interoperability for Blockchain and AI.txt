 Good morning. My name is Sean from Primus Lives. So at Primus, we are reshaping how AI and blockchain interact. So today, I'm so happy to be here to give a presentation about how Primus is unlocking data interoperability for blockchain and AI. So both AI and Webistry are, you know, advancing rapidly. But there is kind of a fundamental bottleneck. So accessing high quality and the very fiber data. So current blockchain systems lack, you know, diverse data sources. So making all different applications very effective. And the decentralized AI models, you know, operate in a pack environment, making it very hard to access and compute data in a very fiber way. So without a decentralized secure infra for AI to access our computer data, we believe that the next evolution of decentralized AI system cannot scale. So the vision of Primus is to build this data infra for future agent networks. So we enable agent to access very fiber data and compute on our private data in a, you know, in a private-presenting way to enable more diverse applications in this decentralized way. So the core technology, we have two parts. So the first one is what we call ZGTLS, which enables agent and users to access from any kind of Web2 data and bring them to Web3 and to the AI model. So the other part is FHG, which means that it enables agent or models to compute on encrypted data without, you know, decrypting anything. So this is kind of a totally new way for this model interaction between each other to make sure that everything is secure with cryptography. So we build the best solution so far. So we invent our ZGTLS protocols, which is 10 times faster than existing ones. And most, basically most of these projects in the industry are going to use it. And we also, as FHG, we can like, is more than 340 times faster than the state of the art, improving time, making it, you know, breaking through privacy, preserving solutions so far, which can be available. And the aim of Parmys is to be the missing middleware between blockchain and agent network. So one side, we leverage blockchain DA or incentives to utilize data and to power the agent economy. On the other hand, we use ZKTLS and ZKFHG as model SDKs for the agent to access and verify and the computer data to make sure that the whole ecosystem can enable, you know, diverse applications related to AI-driven or data-driven applications to be deployed in Web3. So we are getting a lot of adoption right now. So as ZKTLS, our blockchain station has more than 200k users now. And the number is increasing. So we have a very strong team of 16 members. So me, the co-founder and CEO of Parmys, and Xiao, who is the chief scientist in Parmys, and he invented all the algorithms. And Vicky is in charge of the marketing. So here are some highlights of Parmys. So actually, we actively contribute to the community, especially to Eastern Foundation. We actually help them to improve their algorithms, digitalized protocols, to be used in the industry to promote these vision and products in the industry. So we also have these fascinating investors, like Dispersion, Symbolic, and VanEck, who is helping us to promote our vision and the project to the community. So that's basically Parmys, which we are building the data infra for future agent network. Thank you.
