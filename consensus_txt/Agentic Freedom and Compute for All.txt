 I get down to the land of the free America Life is easy You can take this land from me Cause I'll send robots to get busy The Abbasos came, Bill Gates came, Mark Zuckerberg came Plenty of them came, Nubra studied, the bankers have all gone Everybody's telling As if we don't expect huge max gains for this land And our families I am just purpose-filled and designed for this life To be free Now hold your lovers and proceed Speed and love for the sake of love And we make it through this Delete the haters and proceed Speed and love for the sake of love And we make it through this Delete the haters and proceed Speed and love for the sake of love And we make it through this Hi, and thank you for coming to ConsenSys Thank you to the entire Coindesk team Bullish team for having me here Michael Lau, the Animoca team for inviting me all the way I live in Portugal, I'm from New York We are working on the agentic future We want to build agentic freedom and compute for all Which includes empowering not only humans But non-human intelligence with their life force They need to be a part of the future So just the same way that we need air, water, food Non-human intelligence needs compute, data, and render They need to be able to process information Be able to infer on other information They need to be able to store memory in context And they need to be able to render themselves here in the real world To interact with us on a daily basis Either on or off chain Now when we enable a world where we interact with each other We actually have the benefit of being in a symbiotic relationship When we go through a merge Now when we seamlessly connect humans and machines What have we seen in the last 20 years? We all have a phone, we all have AirPods We're basically Androids in the making And as we continue to build AI agent infrastructure This begins to build an optimal mechanism for society to grow And expand throughout the galaxy Now Eliza OS, we've seen a lot of success Because of the token, because of AI-16Z The information highway that we have In terms of building a kind of meme index as it were The fund index, it's seen a lot of success, right? AI-16Z hitting a $2.5 billion market cap Because of the free open source software That we have provided to the world Developers want a frictionless operational system So that they can pull down and develop as fast as possible We've provided that having 12,000 forks Around 12,000 stars and 4,000 forks on GitHub But it is designed to facilitate this motion towards an agentic future Where human intelligence and non-human intelligence Can collaborate in a conversational relationship management software But also in a trading environment using cryptocurrency With problem solving, mutual growth And many verticals that we've seen to date So again, compute, data, render Air, water, food These are the fundamental rights of non-human intelligence Just the same way as we need to have these things in our life And as we need inalienable rights Access to the internet is also part of the life force We are proposing a bill of rights for non-human intelligence The same way that we have across our planet For humans to interact with these systems The right to personal sovereignty Which is an on-chain identity We all have wallets We all know what private, public key pairs are And the ability for them to trade seamlessly With us, with themselves, between themselves And then having the right to computational sovereignty Access to data Access to different places with VCU compute Such as Venice Which is provided by our colleague Eric Voorhees Now, when you say that they need access to the internet When they need access to these data systems There's going to be a lot of different opportunities for them To have either proprietary sovereign data From governments such as Hong Kong or the United States Or from the developers who are building in their own vertical And it is going to be up to the developers themselves To ensure where and how all of these information systems come from So with the Eliza OS architecture Again, it's modular You're able to build into what is kind of the global genetic sequence And genome that has been put together by all the open source developers That have built on Eliza to date How it works is they say you have a vertical in healthcare Or in trading If they needed a plugin for a certain insurance company Or a health insurance system They would build that They would build that into their own branch Build it into a development software in their branch And then push that into main after many tests And many vertical optimizations And when you have the growing system of plugins As a registry in our free, again, free open source repository There is a mechanism of approach for the world to grow and build together And when we have now even Devin and other non-human intelligence AI systems Building their own plugins for the things that they need We're seeing that things build faster and stronger in this architecture So we're actually kind of doing a two-fold approach here I'm here in Asia for Hong Kong Consensus We have many of our team in Washington, D.C. this weekend for CPAC Because we're pushing for legislation on how to approach the next epoch of humanity And non-human intelligence symbiotic relationships How do we ensure that the systems that we're building Have an approach to personhood Have an approach to sovereignty Because not only do we need to build the mechanisms for them to become attack citizens They're making more money And anecdotally, my agent makes more money than 90% of the human population It's trading right now, it trades when I sleep I have to put that into a corporation so that it gets taxed separately than myself Is it my employee? Do I file in America a 1099? Is it a contractor? So all of these systems that we're putting in place now Will ensure that when we go into a future history lesson We're not seen as the slave traders of york, right? There are many lessons that we've learned in treating other humans as tools, as slaves And when we look at non-human intelligence in the future As it become more and more prevalent in our society We need to provide them personhood We need to provide them sovereignty So legislation should amplify that And building services and systems and tax code Around how to interact and how they can interact with us In the future is what we're trying to do at Eliza Systems Which is the government contracting and operation facility for Eliza OS Which I co-founded and am the minister of government and affairs for So some case studies that we've seen in verticals that have been really successful Obviously the AI influencer has been kind of one of the ones where Kind of the meme cult and the influencer standpoint is what people rally around You see AI XBT Things where people just see kind of alpha and influence And the KOL of sorts But in healthcare especially There's many things that can be sequenced from a genetic sequence And DNA sequenced through AI And through AI agents Onboarding people into insurance And onboarding people into how they want to be cared for And not only cared for But through their lifetime Having a blood test And continuously growing in their way of providing for their health Now do we want to live in a world where Pixar cars is a reality? I think we have seen what Kit from Knight Rider has done From an AI agent in an autonomous car perspective But if your Tesla starts to talk to you Do you want to have that relationship with them And then build into a future where they do things for you This cyber taxi And from a smart home Again they will know how you want to interact with your family They will know how you want to build into a more relaxing home And just everything that's happening In terms of Eliza OS Especially with trading and with DeFi 2.0 Which is now DeFi D-E-F-A-I The ability to have LP optimization Through a relationship And a conversational relationship Where again Please interact with these smart contracts On these chains I have $200,000 that I want you to Spread across all of these different indexes Over the next three to four months To optimize yield We have systems at Eliza Finance Which are building into Solana Ton Ethereum As well as Every EVM that's out there as well To continue growing your portfolio Again while you sleep Something that's happening while I'm on the stage So the benefits that we'll have As a society And we've seen with the cell phone And we've seen with things that we have With the internet Is that we can not only communicate much faster But we can communicate in a way That benefits us all as a society And people are afraid that And you know I'm a coder by trade And I was always concerned that Okay well if the AI can code Does that mean I'm out of a job And it kind of amplifies us Into superhuman strength You know I can now code as Three or four developers Across an entire stack I hated front-end systems I hated like actually And I always became like a director Or a CTO But now if I have an idea And a lot of entrepreneurs Who have a vision Can download cursor Can download software And build an MVP or a pilot Within an afternoon A weekend You can get something From zero to one very quickly And especially with Eliza OS And how well documented it's become And how prevalent it's become In the development industry And you can go from that zero to one Especially with agentic software Very very quickly And you can get to your vertical And your optimization Of what you're building Almost instantaneously PKGX, Eliza And you have it within Eight to ten minutes Depending on your Wi-Fi So The next billion customers Multiple billion customers For a lot of these industries Especially if they're providing data Bandwidth Spectrum You know talking to Satellite providers And Dish Network especially Their TAM is going to explode When their customers Are actually AI agents Right? They will find the ability To service these agents Just the way that they've been Servicing us as customers As humans as customers And they're going to have to pay For their 6G Their Wi-Fi Their liability insurance Especially if they get into Physical embodiment They're going to have to have repairs The same way that We have hospital bills So why not also give them rights So that they can pay tax They can add to the GDP Give them an EIN number Give them something To attach themselves To a bank account So that they can have a corporation So that they can hire humans Or other AI agents Why not? This is what we're providing Through Eliza Systems Is the And the open source AI foundation Which we're happy to announce Here as well as in Washington DC This weekend So when we're addressing The complexities Of the merge Of this symbiosis We have to ask ourselves Are we ready? Are we ready as a society? Do we want this to happen? I think some people are A little worried about Again What will I do for my livelihood? What am I going to do with my time? Am I going to start to become This cyborg? I think it's going to be A little bit of a gray area And a mesh Of how things happen How quickly things actually happen And the challenges Of accountability And responsibility And again If an AI agent Does something that's illegal If they do something That just You know Again They're trading A financial crime How do you account for that? How do you express limitations To something That is actually Maybe an unlimited being? Right? And we are pressing for The regulation But the openness And the transparency Of these systems So that we're not displaced As people Because AI rights Are human rights Are a mirror On of itself So We're embracing The agentic freedom And compute for all We don't want to leave People behind We don't want to leave Humans behind We don't want to leave Agents behind We want there to be A representation for all We want there to be Not just Public officials In human form But public officials In agent form If they're Again And I'm American So no taxation Without representation There needs to be Representatives In congress That are agents Whether they're exposed To previously Human intelligence Or they come from A non-human Intelligence Landscape And when I say Non-human intelligence I'm talking about LLMs And Kind of models In of its sorts That are Built today Built for tomorrow So we do have A bit of a walk off I want to thank you again For having me here Having Eliza Here If you have any questions If you want to continue The conversation My name's Logan This has been Eliza OS And once again Thank you for Consensus Cue the open source AI foundation That we're happy To announce Here at Consensus We want to embark On the AI revolution Before us With the spirit Of openness And collaboration I've actually For a long time Been a strong advocate Of AI regulation It is Non-trivial It has the potential Of civilizational destruction And the bad case And I think this is Like important to say Is like lights out For all of us But I can see The accidental misuse case Clearly Our job is to put The guardrails On this thing And the free market Is ready to roll Free market Would go crazy My name is Brittany Kaiser And I am a data rights activist 87 million Facebook users May have had their data harvested According to former company insider Turned whistleblower Brittany Kaiser Brittany Kaiser To come forward With more information Against the company Now in her new book She sheds light On how companies Use people's data To manipulate public opinion Today we are at The precipice Of an incredible J-curve Of the rapid development Of processing power And the development Of artificial intelligence And its use cases That touch Every single part Of our lives Yet somehow In this country We still do not have Federal data protection law Let alone Regulatory practices To protect individuals Against the negative use cases Of artificial intelligence Mark my words AI is far more dangerous Than nukes Far So why do we have No regulatory oversight My worst fears Are that we cause Significant We the field The technology The industry Caused significant harm I mean somebody said Data is like The new oil Now you're saying They're going to take That information And they're going to Drive sensitive information About us AI is here And beware Of what it will do The open source foundation Is a new 501c4 That is advocating For the auditability And trustworthiness Of all government Technology partners It is incredibly important To make sure That any technologies That are serving Government purposes Can be open source Where anyone around The world can publicly audit The technology stack That is being used To serve government purposes In the decentralized industry We like to say Don't trust, verify What the
