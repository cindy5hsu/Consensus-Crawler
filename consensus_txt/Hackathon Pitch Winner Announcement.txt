 Thanks everyone for waiting till the very end of the conference. Super cool to see you all still here. We are going to now announce the top three winners of the Hackathon Pitchfest finals. They were hard to decide. We spent a little bit more than we anticipated judging them and figuring out which one was the best. But congratulations to everyone for pitching on the stage. Super cool that you had the chance to pitch at both. And ultimately, we came up with top three winners across a variety of different sectors. We have, in no particular order, the top three winners who are going to actually get free tickets to the next consensus in Toronto. So that'll be super cool. And then obviously, you're able to, as well, network with the judges and get their feedback as well, because that will be super helpful for you as you continue to build your ideas and refine them. So we're going to be announcing Zona as one of the winners. And everyone can come up to the stage as we announce your team's name. So welcome up, Team Zona. Cool. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. Next up, we're going to have Team Voxify. Cool. Nice work. Awesome. Awesome. And then last but not least, we're going to have Team Zeno. So welcome to the stage, Tom and Clive. Cool. Looks like they're not here at the moment. So we'll proceed and we'll take a group photo with all the judges, too. So thank you very much to all the judges for helping select our winners. We're going to take a big group photo with all the judges. We're going to take a big group photo together and yeah, that'll be the conclusion of the Pitch Fest. Cool. Thank you. Thank you. Cool. Thank you. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Well, yeah.
