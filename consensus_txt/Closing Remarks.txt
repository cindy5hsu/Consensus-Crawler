 All right, y'all. No, this is just a note to thank everybody. I'm going to take 10 seconds for coming today to Rock Radio Web3R and Culture Summit. Shout out to our partners over at Mog, SoFund, and WalletConnect, without whom we couldn't have made that happen. But I want to give a big shout out to Bullish for putting this whole thing together in Hong Kong, for bringing us out here. Shout out to Coindesk. On behalf of myself, president of Dust Town, Rock Radio, Decrypt, and Myriad Markets. Make sure you sign up, Myriad Markets. And with that, peace out, Hong Kong. See you tomorrow morning.
