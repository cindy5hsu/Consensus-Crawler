 all right good morning guys we are gonna discuss a little bit about how memes went from this uh just like map pictures and like from like 2014 to 2021 and then turn into all these like cults where you're not just based like it's not just based around the picture but more of the idea of community so what was the tipping point for this to happen was it the anti-vc narrative or was it just you know people were just like bored of losing money on stuff that was pushed on i think you can talk to this better than i can yeah i think a lot of the ideas behind why people wanted to be interested in meme coins more so than traditional launch tokens or any of these investments was the theory that a you know a fair launch token uh something without you know years of vc investment or any idea of like people getting in earlier than you meant that these tokens were going to perform better for retail traders and for individuals who were excited about the opportunity to get into something you know where they didn't feel it obviously things like echo and now the democratization of a lot of these rounds have proven that there is the opportunity for teams to get in earlier or for individuals to get in early as investors but meme coins overall i think have shown especially in the last couple of weeks that being early in something based on its launch doesn't necessarily mean that you're early inside of these tokens anymore and maybe that there wasn't that those opportunities there's still you know insider groups there's misinformation or information asymmetry that people are having to fight against um and so memes were a really good mechanism for people to feel like they were getting early into the start of something for crypto and now i think with the financial engine that's been pushed through they're not as uh as tried and true anymore um does that mean that people go back towards like vc or traditionally launched tokens maybe but i think right now memes overall need to solve a lot of their narrative issues yeah i mean i've been saying this for a long time but uh having traded and market make it a bunch of these coins you start to realize that the the product that you're building and then the token itself are both separate things in essence and when i see what was doing well and what was not doing well uh you know something like cardano let's say it's it's maybe built on a brand and an idea and a community and like you know sort of like a central orator in that case um and ultimately like meme coins have taken it a step further where they just accept that there doesn't even need to be a product you can just create all the other stuff without a bunch of fancy tech and um obviously gme and the stock market show that potentially like this is something that can be done there i think crypto is a much better version of those um meme stocks though you have um you know this like transparency on like where the tokens are and what's happening there's a lot more you can um uh control but yeah obviously right now we're in a bit of a crisis in terms of meme coins like is it over we had we had i think this was the meme coin cycle for sure um and now we have to decide if we're gonna keep the casino going or change it up so let's talk about specific meme coins like say mog or bonk or these famous ones that are popped up what are like some uh really specific drivers that led to growth of those tokens well was it just like an early community getting rich and uh spreading a message to like across social channels or maybe like something else would actually i guess the question here being like what specifically uh like supercharged growth of like these calls yeah so it depends a lot on the initial launch like every meme is going to be different in terms of why does it end up taking off some of these are you know cult of personality tokens they're ideas where if you're attaching a meme to a specific individual trump being the you know the probably the largest example that we're going to see um it becomes easy with the idea of as long as that person or you know the animal or whatever it is behind it becomes larger and more popular then ideally the value of that brand which is a you know being represented by the token itself continues to increase and continues to become much more popular um then you have you know more so the community focused memes or any of these other tokens where it's a little bit more on the idea of who are you bringing together in terms of the idea of like spreading specific messages so bonk was a reaction to the ftx collapse and the idea of bringing people together with one central token that could be utilized in a variety of different ways across the chain so it's an easy message when there's not a lot of positivity going on inside of the ecosystem to come together and to work on you know one dog coin that's just fun and a little bit of a of a change of pace from what people were dealing with in 2022. then obviously you have the the change into these you know fair launch memes and these ideas where as long as a lot of people can get together and can talk about you know the idea behind them then it turns into you know the catchphrases that you see on crypto twitter or any of these other things where the idea is can you find more people to spread that message to and if so what does it mean in order to get more people to join that cult yeah cults obviously can do well um and then things just sort of grab attention can do well so we've seen a couple things come and go this cycle but they had obviously a really high peak like goat is one where people were like oh my god ai is actually a thing and then now this ai is talking about a coin it got so many people excited we didn't last i would say so um it kind of shows like how long the attention cycles last and then people start thinking okay like why am i holding this like do i need to rotate into the next one am i too late and um it's always become a game of are there going to be like next stages like is there going to be a centralized exchange listing and then another one and is there going to be like um someone to buy the bag later and unfortunately that kind of plays out as a cycle um the things that maybe last are things like pepe for example it's such a fundamental uh part of internet culture and i think those are like maybe like the more sustainable ones yeah i think just on attention cycles uh we've all seen that meme of like the roller coaster going up and then getting smaller each time and then i think the latest in that trend was the presidential coins that happened so africa launched like central african republic launched one and then we had libra and uh it just turned out to be it could have been something but it turned out to be like this crash grab do you want to like talk a little bit about how uh they it started as an anti-vc thing and became a big insider player which could have become something but this it seems to have ended now yeah libra was something where it didn't really have the opportunity to turn into you know the full-fledged meme of this uh like uh country token um it was an opportunity where it was being pushed as an opportunity to be you know the economic future of the country and being organized in that way and then you know six to eight hours after the launch the president of argentina comes out and disavows the token and kind of destroys that whole entire narrative um versus what you had saw with like the central african republic tokens which you know was on a much longer time frame in terms of the availability and these things being in there um the difficulty is is that that relies on a core thesis for countries that have struggling centralized currencies that by suddenly turning it into a decentralized currency designed to be you know launched on a blockchain as a replacement or as a supplement to any of those initial tokens that suddenly a meme coin is going to be managed better than the central reserve tokens that are that are representing you know the country's day-to-day transactions and i don't think that really has panned out maybe because it hasn't been as strong of a thesis like the us dollar is backed by aircraft carriers and and the us treasury right that's pretty good uh it's a little bit more difficult to say what any of the meme tokens that are supposed to represent these countries are supposed to be um and i think we saw the you know the crash and burn of libra which happened for a variety of different reasons as an example of you can't just say that the meme token is going to take over like the total economy of a country um you do need to have some sort of significant driver or at least a way to connect it directly to you know maybe a central bank or any of these other economic drivers in order for that to have reach it doesn't mean that memes can't be valuable or continuing to increase in terms of what their their range is but in order for that to be channeled into something that's going to replace you know the central economic power of a sovereign nation state that needs to be a little bit more more seriously organized it's not it's too serious for a meme is what i'll leave it as yeah i mean the other part of it is that we you know we see people have fun it's sort of like a casino we forget how big casinos are like singapore macau vegas all of these they annually make something like 20 billion dollars of gambling revenue and you could argue that you know something like solana is maybe an even better casino than all of these and um you know we might not be sitting in the high roller room at the at the venetian and and seeing like the the vip coming in and you know playing 10 million but on chain we can see these kind of people that just there was like a launch of a pain token last night and um somebody was just like paying two thousand dollar gas a minute just to try to buy the first ten million dollars and then ended up just kind of people have a lot of money to gamble with and speculate with you know they want to try to make even more it's like a pure um greed in essence but the problem sometimes is like there's too much uh extraction so with this argentina coin obviously they could have maybe um taken their time and and tried to do things a bit longer term but everybody involved maybe um wasn't quite prepared to play it slowly um and it's hard to blame them because the people that are participating in these kind of roulette and blackjack and all these games and then the meme coin game they're not fee sensitive that's very clear otherwise you wouldn't have every intermediary charging like a few percent you know you have the the the front end and then like the mev and you know the protocols charging and then the fees and like there's so many like layers people don't mind because they're going for this like you know 100x so if they're paying 10 doesn't matter um and i think like as an industry obviously we want the attention of meme coins like i i would love to keep all the people that are participating in blockchain that otherwise wouldn't they wouldn't get onboarded if if not for these uh kind of like fun coins that they don't need to understand a bunch of you know zk tech in order to just uh buy buy a token so that's good i think we just need a balance between um you know having them come in and then hopefully stay and and not just um get a bad experience yeah it's not a um it's not something where there's going to be you know a removal of the idea of like financial incentive incentives especially inside of crypto you know this goes from the original bitcoin white paper right of like decentralized peer-to-peer cash um to you know the articles that we saw in the ico boom of everybody's getting hilariously rich and you're not versus the ideas that we're seeing now where the ideas of going into fair launch tokens are the opportunities for people to get early access to something that can potentially you know massively change their financial future but just because everybody gets access to a contract at the same time when it launches the mechanisms that have been built into blockchain infrastructure don't necessarily provide the same access to every single person it's much different to be playing a roulette table when there's a thousand people trying to get there in front of you and each of them are bribing the the guy behind the table to let them put their money down first or to see where the ball is going to land and just because you get access to oh there's going to be a you know a trump token launching that doesn't mean that you're going to be the first person to tip gito correctly in order to get your transaction through that doesn't necessarily mean that you're going to be receiving a contract not five minutes before it launches like any of these teams that are working on the hardware side or getting ready to release these things and maybe you're not running a dedicated validator that has some of the lowest latency and gets first slot in there for your transaction just because there's the idea of free and democratized finance doesn't necessarily mean that that's what happens in practice because the people who are putting the time in on a technical side or the money in on the financial engineering side are still going to get the advantage so maybe the vc timeline of you know multiple years before a token goes to its tge doesn't exist but that five minutes before the token actually goes from on chain to in your wallet that has massively compressed but there's still competition there and the average retail trader isn't going to have the advantage over the other people who are earlier inside of that cycle even if now it's just a couple of minutes versus a few years so let's talk about a culture like trump for example one of the biggest kols on the planet and his token is down 75 percent or like 80 percent from peak so for something that's even directly officially backed by trump to be that down like what next what you know what's the next step for that it's listed everywhere it's backed by by sitting us president do you guys see like it ever going on like not specifically trump but tokens like that like what's the catalyst that will keep driving growth in those specific tokens which are sort of like do we have a salini investment thesis for this or uh how are we feeling on trump no i mean with trump specifically it's still like a very successful token even you know people always look at the top and how much is it down from the top i mean yeah you get these like random uh liquidity spikes and they mark something on the chart but it doesn't really mean that much i think the fact that it's still you know multi-billion token that got created out of thin air um for most people that participated early you know they they could have made money i think of course there's always i don't know who like thinks to themselves that something's cheap when they look at it and it's a trading at 70 70 billion fdv and it just got created so um look like we'll we'll see more of this uh experimentation probably other um key figures in culture will use crypto to create a token because it's just it's just pure financialization and um um you know to her credit like iggy azalea has put a lot of her heart into trying to make that work and it's not easy right like um ultimately even if you're putting your heart and soul into um something if people feel like it's lost momentum they'll still move on so there probably needs to be um um yeah even with the trump token um some some other kind of ingredient i don't know what you think that could be yeah i mean i think you'll have heard from a lot of the uh good like rwa distributors and providers that have been speaking here um over the course of of consensus around the idea of tokenizing everything right taking these esoteric financial products and turning them into something that's on chain that's much more easily tradable that's much more understandable that could be oil futures or you know treasury bonds or any of these sorts of things and when you have this idea of tokenizing everything that puts an inherent value on the idea of culture on the idea of community and on the ideas of how you can you know apply that or how you can apply price to value which are two distinctly different things so you can see the idea of the value of community metrics you can see the value of what does it mean for you know the trump dance to go live and across a variety of different social media areas but there's not like an inherent dollar value in terms of the trump token every time that he gets put onto a a specific area to talk but what you do have is a good understanding of okay if people are trump supporters they probably buy the watches or the shoes or the stakes or any of the other things that that has been a very good organization of proving that if people are trump fans they'll probably buy trump products what that team is going to be doing a good job and you saw this with what they did for for president's day most recently is the idea of taking people who are traditional buyers of trump related products this brand this opportunity that's going on right this whole cult of personality they know that people are going to spend money on that so how do you get people to spend money on the token not just on the products or the services that are related there and take that cult which is you know at least everybody who is a member of the mega movement inside of the united states maybe not every voting republican but additionally like people around the world who are trump supporters and various different sovereign nation states if they can somehow show support or affinity for that movement via the token whether it's formally acknowledged or whatever that relationship ends up being then there's a an idea then there's the opportunity to put a dollar value on what is you know the trump brand or the you know the opportunities that are going on there and every other politician in the world and probably why we saw the the argentina tokens get pushed as far as they did are is going to see the opportunity of building their own brand on the world stage and directly applying a value to that based on something like these meme coins does that mean that every single politician is going to have their own token no but there's going to be new upstarts or people who are trying to get into these positions we're going to see the opportunity for campaign fundraising or any of these other areas where they see it as a way to essentially be a proxy for their value to their voting base um so what does that mean for trump as a token you know maybe you don't want access to uh like the djt stocks or the trump media empire or any of those things but there is a very clear existing relationship where people will be spending money based on the implied value of what it means for trump to be related to something so as long as they can figure out the way to get the uh like the token itself to be inside of that inherent social value then they're going to be able to push it relatively far and i think that's going to see a lot of interesting follow-on effects for the idea of token tokenizing reputation which previously was used in a bunch of like twitter platforms and clones and all these different things and the access to private groups becomes a lot more interesting when you actually trade the value of these brands or these individuals uh maybe even going into like perpetuals or contracts or any of those things but that's far down the line what you can definitely rely on is that crypto people will find a way to make money off of some sort of tokenization or some sort of contract for future events and you know that's just based on inherent human financial models yeah i like the idea of how uh people can use the trump token to sort of express their bet on trump as a whole and now you even have a bunch of fun firms in the u.s that have filed etfs like trump etfs melania some of these other tokens so as an institute an investor what would you be sort of looking at if you want to gain exposure would it just be the would just be using this etf as a beta bet on what trump is going to do or like is there some way to like uh fundamentally think about okay there's this meme coin etf and me as an institutional what are some fundamental factors that i can use to analyze before allocating some money into these etfs i mean i don't know the whole concept of a meme coin etf um seems like a very top-ish thing um i i don't think it makes much sense like if you're buying an etf maybe you want some like uh combination of an index that's safe and you know makes sense but with meme coins you actually want to just choose the one and hopefully like it's like a you know i put my number it's it's like an etf is like you go to the roulette table and you just bet all the numbers and then you just like lose three percent slowly at least if you're just choosing one maybe you choose the right one you put the right one and you get like a 30 35x or whatever um so that that's that's a weird concept i think the other things we've seen is um anybody can make the same meme coin a thousand times like we saw with cz had a dog called broccoli he said here's the name of the dog i'm not gonna make a meme coin everybody else make a meme coin and just i don't know how many of the same meme coin got created and now like today i think i saw that yesterday binance uh chose three of them so there's three broccoli meme coins that they're putting on their alpha list um so it kind of it's good i think we're finally getting to that we're accelerating the learning and we're like what does it even mean to have a a meme coin when you can just have another contract another contract like who annoys it to be like the one and what if they had no several ones because they don't mind just letting multiple ones fight and um unfortunately like the sophistication needs to come that even if one goes a higher market cap it just means maybe that it has more supply constricted and the cabal just pushes it up just to get you know the front runner spot we saw this with uh nero where you know they really managed to get one bigger but then binance listed a different one so um i think the ones that can do well are the ones where either the creator of the meme or um there's some like official aspect that can't be replicable where somebody can just fork it and um that may be becomes investable if there's some strong kind of identity behind that or some strong person behind it um but people are still figuring this out i think like in traditional finance like the the definition or the idea of etf are different than what these crypto etfs are ending up becoming right like triple q is designed to represent the overall like s p 500 as an index so you don't have to buy every single stock you just get the opportunity to purchase it and get exposure to ideally all these things going up into the right which that becomes more interesting when you look at the crypto products done by like either what cf benchmarks is doing or like the gmci meme indexes or any of these things where they're designed to give people exposure to a bunch of assets that they probably don't have the time to find you know 10 different memes across four different chains and invest in every single one of them and pick the winner um but what we saw with like ibit and the bitcoin etfs is those are not broad exposure to a variety of different assets so the single asset exposure that are allowing essentially like different custody options for bitcoin and now you're going to see one for obviously you've seen the ones for ethereum and you'll probably see litecoin solana xrp and a bunch of these other single assets going forward and when we for bonk made the decision to like apply for us etf listings the goal isn't the idea of like okay let's get every single person who has a retirement account to purchase bonk and and put it into their long-term holdings next to gold or u.s treasuries or whatever else like it's a different investor risk profile or these ideas but what it does mean is some sort of uh financial stamp of approval right whether that's through uh like the sec or different financial services departments or different countries um you get to the point where people are able to say like okay i don't have to go teach uh every single financial issuer uh what is the correct contract to buy right they're just able to understand it's like if i want exposure to bonk i buy the bonk product if i want exposure to doge i buy the doge product and i no longer have to worry about any sorts of things because these investors are probably not going to be the individuals who are searching on chain and waiting for cz's tweet about broccoli or or any of these other things right but they have an understanding that um you know fundstrat put out a few different pieces around the ideas for how meme exposure to different portfolios continues to improve and outperform just like pure bitcoin additions and pure bitcoin additions to portfolios outperform traditionally holding things inside of the stock market so you're going to see more and more of these financial issuers who are advocating for the idea of get some crypto exposure into the traditional equity holdings and more of these you know either single or multi-asset etfs are just going to be easier for investors to have an understanding of like well i want exposure to crypto but i don't know what i want to buy so i just buy this basket of things that my you know individual advisor has purchased if you're working inside of crypto that means it's much easier to get access to this capital and you don't have to necessarily rely on the you know the cabals around you know listings or organizing any of these things if you can get it to the point where it's attractive to institutional investors it's a whole list of challenges and there's a whole bunch of things that people need to solve but it solves the core issues of i don't know what token i want to buy if i want access to a single token or a single meme but they know that they're able to just purchase the doge etf whenever that gets filed or the bonko etf whenever that gets approved um and the same way then you're able to start building a lot more of the you know the esoteric financial products that we've seen in the derivative space that have been much more successful at driving you know the price of value and finding fair value for any of these things and for most memes we've seen that the fair value is something that the market has a very difficult time ascribing to especially it usually goes very high and then very low over a period of you know a couple of days so once things get to the point where they've gone through these financial processes of getting regulated and listed you know that's not going to be something that happens in a three-month period or you know based on when finance alpha or coinbase you know listing decides that they want to push something through that that listing process it becomes more so a stamp of approval of there's been at least some level of diligence done there's been at least you know some ideas around the value proposition behind these assets and that's what they can start pushing towards individuals if they choose to make that investment and it's no longer the idea of like well my buddy posted a contract and i think it's going to do pretty well it turns into the idea of like well my financial advisor said i needed to you know pick three cryptos to get one percent exposure to and they they go to it in that side and ideally it turns into the same thing of nvidia apple or robin hood or any of these other stocks that you know individuals want to get access to and they can just choose hey i want exposure to xyz that's coming to the end of it but uh for the next uh sort of growth cycle for meme coins like do you do you see it coming from outside of the crypto bubble in which we exist uh say like how like nfts really broke into the public conscious you had uh airline tickets you had like sneakers you had a lot of things which you know non-crypto i would say like non-crypto native people were still interacting with but they haven't as much with meme coins so you do you see uh sort of a next growth phase is coming from some of these like non-crypto companies like issuing their own sort of meme coins as a memorabilia or like similar to an nft i think you saw for the nft specifically it was the promise of future utility or the idea that you know the the asset or something that you own is going to be useful later on it can you know unlock new new values for memes it's really hard because they're a you know a result of regulation where teams were afraid to ascribe real value to the tokens themselves they wanted them to just be as far away as possible and maybe they're just limited to governance or anything else um ideally the evolution of memes go from just a representation of popularity into ideally the idea that they can be connected towards like the value of any of these different brands but that requires a lot of teams to show up and take ownership and responsibility there and i think that's probably the key to get people to come in and then want to continue to purchase or provide value to these things but that that role requires the internal teams to make a lot of decisions not just wait for some eventual retail wave to come in and buy bags of you know the people who aren't necessarily doing a lot um i have like a little bit of a different take i just generally think that it's so i mean you probably know this is even better than i do but like launching a meme coin and then trying to just sustain it forever it's on the blockchain and there's always people that hold it they're always asking like when's the next it's so difficult and i don't think brands are gonna just like randomly make tokens that like adidas token and then it doesn't do anything it doesn't have any representation it's just such a potential nightmare um i think we will see a lot more ai agents make their own tokens and try to use those for interesting things and that's maybe like the next wave of meme coins it's going to be very ai driven um you can trust the eyes they're not going to rug you because you know maybe there's a certain code parameter that you know prevents it maybe they um they start bartering with each other with their tokens and if you help me out my token goes up and you and you have some so it'll it'll be interesting to uh to see like how the bots do it not just the humans yeah guess all that's the time we have today thanks norm and thanks jordi uh next time thank you all have a good rest of your day
