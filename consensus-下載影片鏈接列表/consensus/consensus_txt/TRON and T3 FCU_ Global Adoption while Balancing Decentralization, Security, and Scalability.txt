 so we all know justin's son the man that needs no intro whatsoever but we don't know these guys on stage and they're very important people in the good fight against crypto crime so let's start here uh with you give us a quick intro who you are what you're doing and how you're going to fight crypto crime great to meet you run uh yeah thanks for having me here at consensus i'm anthony i'm one of the co-founders of artemis uh we're a crypto data provider that we're trying to bring truth to crypto um so uh organizations like visa paypal standard charter use us uh to understand what people are actually doing on crypto what apps are they using uh where are they from um and what types of payments are they're doing and so you know i think crypto is still unfortunately you know full of sketchy stuff and we hope to bring light and truth to crypto and and promote crypto to be the you know the future of finance excellent go ahead yeah yeah i'm testing oh it works uh my name is arnold i'm ceo co-founder of sphere uh we developed sphere pay uh which is the fastest on and off ramp in the world uh to my knowledge um and we do that using stable coins uh and lower level bank messaging optimization so effectively explicitly defining uh the way that the money flows through banks uh which as i'm sure we'll discuss ends up being quite the headache um simultaneously we're developing sphere net uh which is a private svm cluster uh that automatically runs things like transaction monitoring risk scoring uh some pretty cool uh tie-ins with zero knowledge proofs uh for regulated fintechs who might not know as much about blockchain uh but really see the use cases of stable coins and want an easy way to get started um and yeah mostly active in ladam uh apac the u.s uh and mostly support v2b fintechs uh pleasure to meet you all okay cool so chris who are you my name is chris jian chesky i'm the head of global investigations at trm labs we're a blockchain analytics company i've been here for about two and a half years prior to that i was a special agent in irs crew investigation in the united states and uh happy to be here thanks for having me okay and uh leo right there hi everyone i'm really happy to be a part of this panel uh particularly with such um great panelists here with me uh my name is leonardo real leo it's easier though and i'm heather's chief compliance officer a role i've had since 2018 i'm in charge of the regulated activity including anti-money laundering uh but tether is a really unique company in that unlike most uh let's say vasps we're not singularly concerned with um the activity of our customers uh we're also concerned with the secondary market which has hundreds of millions of users uh so it's a very interesting role very cool and now we have justin's son from tron we all know him so justin i heard that the t3 group which is tether tron trm which is looking to fight crypto crime it was your idea so what's the story there yes um so first of all i think the uh combat elixir activity on the blockchain is not easy right it's uh require uh data analysis require um real time like monitoring um it's also requires like uh report you know i need to find the right person here um i'm really grateful you know um with the work of um tether you know kiam at labs and the tron uh we can all um bring together uh and the show to the regulators and the law enforcement in the world actually we have the professional team uh on those uh uh uh tasks and we make sure uh those tasks uh get down um and and also um i think um for example like uh not like everyone you know in crypto has this kind of the tech force you know focus on this kind of the specific task uh our um task group is um is permanent right so we have the full-time employee um postage updates um update uh uh every quarter and we have tasks uh basically collaborate with the law enforcement uh like every day uh i think by the time pass you know we will see uh more and more job get down uh and and and uh global wise i think the legal authorities uh will believe you know crypto is uh wow the best way to chase the back actor uh um and be transparent right about like all the things happen on the blockchain we can prove to everybody what happened so that's i think the uh wow the best thing happened uh in the crypto okay very cool so chris you are ex-fbi and ex-irr irsci and you know you have fought crime for your whole career how is crypto different in crime fighting because i'm sure there are similar elements across all kinds of crime but like how is crypto unique in this regards yeah great question so uh when i went to the academy one of the things they hammer home to you as an irs special agent is following the money if you can follow the money you can find out who's conducting the illicit activity behind it and certainly there's no truer place for that to happen than with crypto particularly with the public blockchain and so having that skill set is really useful because it applies to so many different types of threat landscapes whether that's sanctions evasion terrorist financing child exploitation if you can if you can follow the money you can figure that out and um this t3 has really been a probably one of the most exciting opportunities we've had at tm in the past couple years that i've been here one because just seen how quickly law enforcement has gravitated towards it we've been successful on five different continents multiple different jurisdictions i'm sure we'll talk about frozen over 131 million dollars and it's been a broad swath of crimes too from money launderers again like terrorist financing narcotics trafficking and scams um and i think ultimately just being able to have a public blockchain allows people like us that may not have access to information like we don't have to go to the bank to get their records to see what happened to somebody's account you can access them the public blockchain and so a lot of the cases that we've teed up have also been proactive we've gone to places like chain abuse and sourced victim reports and be able to confirm their allegations on a public blockchain and trying to do a lot of the work as much as we can for law enforcement around the world okay cool because you know with evidence you have certain standards to use right like a screenshot of etherscan just won't cut it so how does tear on labs produce evidence to be used in investigations and prosecution uh well one of the things i think i'm most proud about of our global investigations team has a lot of former law enforcement like myself so not only would i say that they're probably some of the best crypto tracers in the world but they also understand just investigations in general they understand the context the context behind the transactions and like the human who's ultimately conducting those transactions so how does that fit in how can law enforcement use this string of transactions to then be able to articulate probable cause to be able to get a search warrant so using like their historical experiences uh using the context of what's happening uh with the transactions online but then also that whatever information we can also find with it maybe we can make some connections to twitter to someone's like uh vanity username maybe there's some forum somewhere somewhere where somebody had some type of connection and like really having this whole puzzle that you're able to build out uh particularly from an online public persona uh is i think really critical can get um an investigation a lot of where it needs to go but then ultimately law enforcement can use their authorities and the information they have to take it even steps further okay interesting now for tether why is it important to be part of this you know why is it important that you guys work with tron and trm labs in this effort so it's important because trm labs is and sorry tron is is the blockchain that's most used uh by the world uh in terms of usdt usage of course tether already had an external investigations team prior to trm where we were already working with global law enforcement uh but i think it's really important that where we can uh leverage the the network of some of our trusted partners it just makes sense to be able to do that and so uh tron has a great network trm obviously has a great set of investigators with amazing skill sets and to be able to work with them um in a very fast way is a big game changer for tether uh the name of the game when it comes to blockchain investigations is speed uh if you aren't fast enough to uh get information to the right authorities uh and to tether to freeze uh very quickly then you might have a situation where uh funds are dissipated to another blockchain that maybe isn't feasible or uh through some serve mixing service uh where you might lose sight of the uh of the funds and so um having such great partners who understand the game who understand investigations who are very diligent and want to work quickly is super important and we're very happy to be a part of this uh partnership cool so from tether's point of view like what does it look like when you guys work with tron and trm labs in freezing funds like walk us through the step by step how it works um so in in terms of step by step we have a global investigations team on our side uh we have uh an investigations team where we've sourced people from former law enforcement agencies uh prosecutors offices uh investigators in banking as well as uh blockchain forensics experts and so we have a team that really understands uh the blockchain and they've been working already on their own with law law enforcement like i said uh previously uh but but basically um tron and trm are uh engaged constantly with law enforcement worldwide they have a fantastic network of uh law enforcement they're conducting their own uh and osint investigations and almost kind of tee up uh potential investigations that are in line with uh the sorts of crime typologies that uh tether is interested in uh looking at and uh and that we collaborate with each other in order to stop uh we we've come to know how to work with each other we understand the uh risk tolerance that the companies have and uh we're basically uh uh forwarded different cases uh that we assess and assess at the same time that law enforcement is looking at this and wherever possible uh we quickly organize the appropriate key signers on our side to uh freeze funds as quickly as possible okay cool and then continue to work with law enforcement throughout the case very nice all right so for the t3 group is there like a case you're most proud of like which bust do you think was your most important one in the last year chris how about you chris do you want to take that one yeah sure um i think we highlighted one most recently with spain which i think was pretty impactful that in itself was about 27 million that was frozen and i think what was really kind of unique about that one is they gave us a heads up that they had an operation coming um certainly didn't give us all the details of the operation but pertaining to the side of crypto they knew that they wanted to freeze these funds and uh as many people in law enforcement know that like once you go knock on a door anything can happen and that can include those funds being dispersed all over the world change to different assets and so timing was pretty critical we had about two days or so to get everything um analyzed to have everything ready to go and have it to uh meeting the risk standards for tether to be able to go and then there was a hard deadline things wheels were in motion to have it go and i think that one was probably the most impressive because if we weren't able to work together from the public side to the private side and the partners within t3 to have that queued up uh that money might have been in the wind and they weren't going to hold back the on the ground operations that they had because uh we couldn't get our uh ducks in a row and thankfully we were able to wow it's like that show 24 right it's all about being urgent it's being quick you know yeah it's exactly like that nobody ever eats it just cuts and then you just go on to the next one okay very nice um so for arnold so you guys work a lot with the real world use cases of blockchain and crypto like payments and that kind of stuff and payroll so how do stable coins help with that you know why can't i just run payroll through like ach or something you know how do stable coins help and also like what are the challenges uh involved in this yeah uh so stable coins are super useful because they're a proxy for a dollar account uh dollar accounts are typically permissioned by american banks uh and with a stable coin you basically get a permissionless uh up to you to lose it uh dollar account no matter where you are in the world um if you don't speak english you know all of your documentation is not in english uh kind of makes sense that it's hard to get a dollar account from an american bank and as a result it's been pretty incredible sort of the coinciding of threads between people getting access to dollar accounts and also coming online for the first time uh you know we're pretty active in lat am costa rica hit internet majority penetration about a decade later than the united states and the general adoption of like e-commerce fintech because internet companies need to make money has led to some pretty surprising use cases invoice factoring being an example you know because you now have a dollar account someone can take risk uh and advancing your payment uh and you know generating yield on the back end i've met an amazing brazilian company actually here who does that works with like the coca colas of the world um i think the other really interesting one is internal uh inventory management yeah so if you're familiar with like airwall x or wise or some of these more traditional payments companies stripe they typically have to use swift to send money to their own bank accounts they hold like pools liquidity scattered throughout the world uh and that's how you get money locally stable coins make that 10 000 x faster but i think the challenge really comes back to swift and part of where we've been able to see latency improvements is that if you're outside of the country where the issuer is or where the market maker is it still takes forever it still takes two three five ten days to get in and out of stable coins which kind of like defeats the point of being able to send a stable coin so being able to do that same day uh a moniker we like to use is there is no like costa rica or sorry there is no silicon valley of costa rica means that capital efficiency is super important latency risk because you know if you hold cop overnight colombian peso you could lose 10 of your balance sheet makes tackling some of those less obvious frictions with swift even with stables that much more important okay now what about then for artemis right you guys are in blockchain intelligence you know and all these use cases have intelligence part to it right like there is challenges and threats but you guys are working to like you know help the concerns of trad fi and of stakeholders in making sure blockchain is clean yeah and so from what we're seeing i think um you know i think there are two angles one is that everybody even though you know stable coins don't go up in value uh traditional finance uh has been asking us uh like day in day out um like how much stable coins are in the system is it going up like is there more supply and the reason being that uh stable coins are liquidity and lifeblood of any any network and so ultimately these traditional finance investors care about buying a token like swana or ethereum is it going to go up and so if there's more clean state uh stable coin supply on these networks uh that are powering real use cases naturally these networks value will go up and so again even though you can't invest in stable coins stable coins are very very important uh to the sort of yeah the the livelihood and health of a of a network for sure and you're also ex-trad fi is that correct so one of your trad fi colleagues talking about stable coins is on their radar or is it still something they are going to ignore or what uh they definitely cannot ignore it so i would say we started artemis about three years ago um and i think the only people are talking about stable coins are sort of dex traders who are trying to you know bring liquidity into into crypto but um fast forward to 24 everybody so you know i used to work at paypal i was there for six years uh they are knocking down on our door be like hey we need stable coin data right now we are literally we cannot we do not understand what's going on and we want to know because we want to get into the action and so i would say yeah 2024 was the year of stable coins and i think 2025 will be also continue to be this year of stable coins but then paypal won't get involved if they think that stable coins facilitate you know drugs and crime and that kind of stuff yes exactly so that the question they ask us is hey what are people doing with stable coins and so there's this kind of strange chicken and egg problem here where it's like the you know these public companies in the us won't go into stable coins unless they know what's going on and they know it's clean but then there's no real good data on like what the uh what the clean usages are and so that's where kind of artemis comes in where we highlight a lot of these like use cases like what you know what arno just was talking about with severe pay i can name like 10 other companies that are doing something uh they're really interesting you know not just trading um and you know it's just like these companies aren't being highlighted what being highlighted is trump launching a meme coin and it's kind of unfortunate it's also kind of annoying that you know the meme coins in some ways get the attention when things like payments and payroll and the so-called boring stuff of crypto of sorry trad five rather is on crypto now but not getting the headlines yes exactly um i i actually got a really interesting anecdote yesterday from a large asset manager uh they were like hey the you know i asked them what what's holding back crypto and he was like honestly the wall street journal and financial times all these folks just need to cover the real use cases of crypto because all they cover are like trump stuff and so it's just gonna you know incite fear into the you know the public mainstream mindset but as they say if it bleeds it leads right in media so yeah so justin um tron right now has 62 billion in stable coins on the network how do we get to 75 or 100 billion what's the next step yes um so first of all i i think thanks to uh the tether um power right so we have seen uh one or two billion of usdt increase on tron network uh every month i think the majority of them contribute to the um users action actually uh tron uh um 62 uh billion dollars reserve it's just uh one number i think i have been like more focused on actually we have around 20 to 30 billion dollars uh worth of the transaction volume happen on the network every day i think this is more important and approved to everybody um tether has been used like very actively uh among you the users in the group uh because for ethereum for example uh even ethereum has the equivalent amount of the tether on ethereum but the problem for those ethereum uh the transsector volume is only 10 billion dollars it's only uh probably 30 percent of the uh tron volume so that's why i think our um as a network operator uh our mission is to collaborate with tether uh to make sure the users uh use this stable coin um in the way they want and to guarantee cheap uh faster uh instant transaction uh and they basically can make transaction anytime they want they can deliver the cash uh to uh to uh to the destination um so uh so that's why i think also while the secret recipe of like tron network uh how it got you know so big you know successful um i think we will continue to do that uh we want to deliver this to um to the customer and also uh um with the you know service quality provided by tether uh we want this to be uh uh you know uh available infrastructure for people globally yeah and then we can't get to that point if it's not a clean network if politicians around the world think that stable coins equal drugs and bad actors we gotta keep this clean yeah yes definitely so uh we want like politician law enforcement trust this network too right so i i don't want to give them like an impression once you know any fund goes to crypto it's like goes to um um basically a dart hole or anything right it's it's impossible to trace anymore you know uh the bad actor is just get away with it right with the funds you know it's gone so uh we we want to deliver uh this message to to the regulators it's like crypto is the same space it's just like serves the users better right it's a cheap fast instant transaction but that that it does not mean you know it's a black hole you know once the funds going there it's gone you know we're gonna find like everything we can um by uh uh establishing a very professional team you know making uh phone tracing report you know focus on that uh as chris you know just mentioned you know even a few days you know uh ahead of notice is enough you know we will do whatever we can to help law enforcement to get get back the money yeah for sure um so going over the sphere how do you guys work with trm to make sure that your payroll and your fund flow is clean yeah so you know compliance on chain companies like trm uh basically label cluster various wallets so that way you can check wallets the transactions that are associated with them and basically build like a heat map of like where you know suspicious activity occurring and so naturally we would run that through all the transactions that we facilitate uh supplementing of course uh more traditional i'll call it aml vendors on the bank side it's that combination that really makes it rock solid because you get it on chain you get it from the sending bank you get it from the receiving bank so three layers of you know sanity checks to make sure that there's nothing wrong going on um i think the future uh though will be uh this like weird uh maybe marriage between traditional and on-chain compliance where right now like run times on chains don't really differentiate uh between transaction or account types uh in the same way that they would on a traditional fintech ledger um and you know hopefully this allows us uh not to make it a meme but say ai agents come on and make some of that manual work uh and compliance escalation easier uh you combine that with the work that's being done on zero knowledge proofs and you can start to bake some of these uh controls uh that you would normally pay like a unit 21 on the fiat side for you can bring that data on chain and make it easier for companies like trm uh to really monitor the whole end-to-end picture uh not just like what's coming from exchanges or maybe being bridged uh but you know coming from the fiat world uh and going to it interesting okay so for chris for trm like what's unique about sphere and the challenges you might see in payroll and stuff like that for fraud like is that provide a very unique and different way to look at fraud versus just like transactions permittances is there something there yeah i think so like in crypto investigations it's very important to find these kind of cash out these on-ramps off-ramps of where crypto connects to the real world so you can follow you know a bitcoin transaction all these circles uh but at the end of the day somebody usually wants to use those funds to pay for something right and so having a company that's you know facilitating payroll and other ways to distribute funds like you want to make sure that those are legitimate off-ramps you want to make sure those aren't ghost employees you want to make sure there isn't some types of sanctions invasion going on uh certainly my colleagues back at the iras would make a statement about tax evasion as well and so you know there are many different um specific i'll say threats to be able to focus on so like this just mentioned um there's the traditional fiat side of it and looking like who are these people are legitimate but then also from the payment side where are the funds coming from where are they going i think it's you know kind of unique and crypto sometimes hold themselves to a higher standard even like if you think of a bank and somebody deposits cash and says here like to put this in my account where'd you get it from like my grandma gave it for me well like the conversation is kind of over right like you're going to follow the cash backwards and like look at security footage all the street cameras for the past years like no but in the crypto world you can take those hops backwards and see like oh you said you got this on thursday but really the transaction that's funniness uh occurred like four years ago and it's from a dark net market or something like that and so there are many more um opportunities in crypto to be able to kind of uh make sure that those transactions are safer yeah it's funny actually you can be a cop and work from home with crypto you're not out in the field not doing surveillance you're actually in your house looking at transactions that's quite unique yeah absolutely i had a similar investigation to terrorist financing and i'm thankful i would do not have to be forward deployed to war-torn syria can look at the transactions of an overcover agent you know in my basement at home uh at my own leisure in real time like that is a unique opportunity afforded by a public blockchain very cool so for leo like tether is pretty big in emerging markets what kind of challenges does this bring for compliance because you know in the us or europe or most of asia it's a different story for compliance than in like southeast asia or africa um so tether has taken very proactive steps to ensure that we have the cleanest and safest network that we can have uh and we do this probably in two different ways uh kind of what we do directly and what we do indirectly and so with emerging markets and other markets that we think are important to us we've taken the measures to uh actually proactively reach out to law enforcement usually beginning with the state police in order to uh connect with them build a communications bridge that is highly efficient where they understand uh what our capabilities are and we understand what their capabilities are uh we understand how to communicate with each other very quickly what kind of information we need in order to uh undergo a freeze quickly uh we'll often do cross training so they'll tell us about what they're seeing and we'll also explain to them some typologies that we've seen and in this way we set up um basically a system uh that's very efficient and very effective um i can give an example uh last year we uh started a latam initiative where we went uh proactively to brazil uh chile and argentina in order to do exactly this uh and this allows us to uh begin the relationship in a jurisdiction in the right way in the way that we think is the the correct way by putting compliance first by putting anti-money laundering practices first so that's something that we do very directly with law enforcement worldwide uh it's not only uh in you know countries where we are based it's all over the world and more recently we're even working with a governance uh institution we were not quite yet to announce it um publicly but we're actually helping uh a massive uh global governance institution to train law enforcement in some of the poorest countries in the world to use open source intelligence tools in order to trace uh transactions and and um potential criminal activity uh using blockchain explorers osin scrapers and things of that nature and so we're very active with law enforcement worldwide to keep the network as safe as possible uh that's what we do directly more indirectly though i think that the way that uh anti-money laundering works is is in a way decentralized and uh what i mean by that is that every country creates their own anti-money laundering uh regulations that they then pass on to their regulated uh uh entities like financial institutions or vast virtual asset service providers in most countries and so every um entity uh that has customers and serves uh you know services crypto uh products and services they have their own aml responsibilities uh for their each of their customers and whenever they identify suspicious activity they report it to their local fiu and so you have vasps doing this all over the world reporting this to financial investigations units financial investigation units then share that information with each other globally and so one thing that tether does is as we expand our network and we either partner directly or uh you know help to grow different companies we are very interested in knowing what their aml compliance program looks like and we believe that uh where a company has an excellent aml compliance regime and we you know kick the the tires on that to make sure that that's uh the truth that's a very good sign for us us that's a company that is forward thinking that's thinking about uh long-term success and i think that the the more such partners we have worldwide in developing uh countries and as well as in developed countries the the better chances are that we grow a very clean network and and so we like to work with those sorts of companies well it's also it's pretty cool that developing you know world law enforcement agencies now have crypto training and it really shows the future of finance starts with that where emerging markets have police officers that are crypto native where the fbi or like you know in canada the rcmp might not have that same skill set but they do in say brazil or colombia or chile or somewhere um they certainly have that skill set in the us and canada as well i know but the point being is that the future of finance starts with training up law enforcement in emerging markets yes very very much agree our partnerships with uh emerging markets are really important and and this is the way we like to expand into jurisdictions uh we are now working with 230 law enforcement agencies worldwide across 53 jurisdictions and we've frozen as a company uh over 2.5 billion uh usdt uh we really do believe that uh uh when you have uh when you have kind of the combination of of good regulations good technology that allows for investigations and collaborations with law enforcement with blockchain tracing companies with blockchains like tron um uh etc this is how you keep a good network that will actually be able to scale en masse and meet the requirements uh of uh regulators of governments etc very cool so we have 10 minutes left let's go around the table and talk about what you guys think will drive adoption in the next year justin you're first yes for me i believe still it's the boring topic we talk about today right stable coin the payroll like payment um probably most of the topic media won't pay attention about actually uh really driving the increase of uh uh uh here okay how about for spear pay yeah what do you see as the next factor to drive adoption you know i think people are still pretty early to the internal uh reconciliation like inventory management game um uh a founder within the space uh uh once told me that payments eventually just becomes compliance and risk uh and that eventually either becomes foreign exchange or high risk lending um and within emerging markets this is so powerful because local payment service providers are always going to know more about how to underwrite a local citizen than say a bank in the developed world um so i think you're just gonna see a lot more retail adoption and naturally with some of the uh maybe recent acquisitions and fundraising rounds uh institutions are also starting to take a peak uh 10 000 x so hard to argue against very nice for artemis what what do you think yeah i think um very collaborative regulators um which i think is coming in the united states um because i think what people forget is that one of the most popular financial assets that almost all of you have exposure to which are etfs are actually a collaborative project between u.s regulators and financial institutions um and so if we can bring that sort of collaboration between regulators and innovators again into the world we will see crypto proliferate the way etfs proliferated okay but that starts with compliance though right and making sure that there's rules to be followed in the first place and that companies follow the rules in crypto absolutely um compliance again in a collaborative manner as opposed to like anti-crypto you know operational truck point 2.0 type style like sort of burn everything kind of regulation exactly how about 4trm yeah i love the etf answer like i think of my parents they're never going to bridge assets between blockchains right but they will put money in my children's college savings plans that may have a bitcoin etf so seeing more uh situations like that where more people can be exposed to crypto for positive things uh and then given being the uh token investigator here i think i'm gonna go with just like building trust finding more ways that people can uh see accountability in a blockchain knowing that when they put money into some type of vehicle uh in crypto they'll be able to get it back eventually or the product's gonna do exactly what it is uh and finding more ways like t3 to be able to uh deter illicit actors from going to a blockchain it's never going to be zero right all the reasons we talked about of why crypto is efficient uh low cost is going to attract illicit actors we can't stop that but what can we do to try and keep it minimum i think it's going to help build more confidence and more people in it for the future okay how about for tether uh like i said i think the combination of good regulations technology and collaboration is what really will lead everything but but i think first and foremost good regulation is important i'm currently tracking uh upcoming stablecoin regulations that are uh incoming in many parts of the world including the developing world and i believe that there is um there are a lot of uh institutions that already have a large retail market of their own who are waiting for regulatory clarity in order to create new and innovative products that are a lot more efficient than what they have to offer right now through the use of stable coins and i think that as these regulations uh come to bear we'll see that a lot of institutional uh players will actually uh begin to create more products with stable coins in countries where uh stability is not uh taken for granted and so if you're in europe if you're in uh us or canada for example you're used to having a stable currency it's not a novel thing and you have many ways to pay for coffees you have uh email transfers and you know many credit cards etc uh but if you're in a high inflation environment uh things are a lot different and so i think in those countries it'll be very exciting as uh regulations for stable coins uh come to fruition uh the ability to create the products that perhaps we take for granted in developed countries in those nations i guess we're kind of spoiled in the west where we have visa tap to pay amex lots of dollar access and we might not appreciate the fact the person in you know chile or somewhere where it's inflation prone or argentina has to figure out inflation to buy milk or to buy groceries absolutely and this is why i think heather works so well it's uh usdt offers stability all over the world uh in a very fast and efficient manner and um you know we take this very seriously we understand that this is something that can help uh the whole of the developing world and that's why we put uh aml compliance first that's why we put collaborations with law enforcement first because the only way that this will work the only way that governments can trust this is if they understand that uh there is a way to freeze illicit funds there is someone you can contact in order to uh help uh deter identify and and stop uh criminal activity very nice so justin need the last word what's next for you guys for compliance yeah i think for t3 so first i'm super grateful for tether tm labs and tron team to collaborate together to build this project i think we will continue to invest into this project to continue to grow because i believe the stablecoin market cap overall will triple right even 10x in the next 10 years so i think we will continue to invest into this group and to set like a role model for uh global like regulators um there is some uh past group or some people in the private sector you can come up very nice okay guys that was great fun thanks so much thank you thanks everyone bye
