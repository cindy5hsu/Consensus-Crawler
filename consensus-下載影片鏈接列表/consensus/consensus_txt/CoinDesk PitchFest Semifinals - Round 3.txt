 Music As you remember, this is the heart of Consensus And we are presenting the best startups of the early stage in Web3 Remember, we're celebrating also the companies of the future With the builders of today They will be pitching for the win in front of VCs from around the world Thank you so much again to Dimitra for sponsoring this stage And for all our community partners for your support Cyberport, Angel Hub, W Hub, iOSG, Titanfall Fond, IVC, and Foresight Ventures Well, as you know, if you have been here since the morning How does this work? The startups have three minutes to pitch And our judges will have two minutes extra to ask for questions Startups will be battling for the win One winner, one runner-up From this semifinal, out of 12 startups They're going to be selecting three startups Plus a wild card And they will be pitching later on this afternoon The prize? $5,000 worth of DMTR And five coaching sessions So I'm sure you're all excited for this last session Pitch Fest Let's welcome our judges on stage Starting with Forrest By, co-founder of Foresight Ventures Together with Vladimir Belmyshev CP MyFest Ventures Partners Big round of applause And our first startup of this session is Apilang Who is going to be presenting for this? Domin Urcik Co-founder and COO of Apilang So thanks, my name is Domin Urcik And let me introduce you to Apilang The Web3 development platform That is changing the way developers build Web3 applications So for the majority of developers Developing and building Web3 applications is still a nightmare They have to go through massive time investments Difficult programming languages And disconnected ecosystems The result? Lack of adoption Here comes Apilang A one-stop shop for builders of the future web Now, without Apilang Developers need to go through lengthy researching of documentation They have to go through configuration And integrate it into the product And they have to manage tokens for underlying payments With Apilang It's a matter of one API call and it's done Now, let us step back and see Apilang in the big picture Web1 had cPanel for website hosting Web2 have Firebase for easier development And Web3 has Apilang That is mimicking Web2 development But with all the perks of decentralization And we do that through simple APIs SDKs, pre-built solution And clear documentation We're also governed by the developers And we do all the payments So that developers don't need to handle multiple tokens for payment We provide core services Such as decentralized storage Decentralized hosting Decentralized compute Decentralized identity We provide developers with embedded wallets So they can onboard their users faster We provide pre-built solutions And they can deploy smart contracts as well All that through a sleek dashboard With all the analytics they need We're extremely proud of the numbers We have over 140,000 builders currently registered They created over 100,000 projects Deployed 30,000 NFT collections And so on This shows Apilang is really solving real-world problems To real-world developers We received over 2 million from Polkadot treasury In the past two years Showing that the ecosystem of developers believes This is something they need Furthermore, currently we are enrolled in one of the most premier New York accelerators Helping us get the additional funding as well as enter US market And in the next few weeks Currently we're only building in Polkadot But we will be adding new support for new blockchains And new ecosystems Creating unprecedented growth opportunities Thank you Maybe you can just explain a little bit on the team background Okay We started in 2021 by five founders We all have pretty lengthy experience in blockchain I'm the COO Our CTO has more than 10 years of experience Building complex products in the blockchain space Our CEO, who is currently in New York In the accelerator Also have over 15 years of experience building blockchain Plus some experience in enterprise such as Commvault And so on Currently there's 15 people working for Apilang And yeah, as I said We're working hard to become the next go-to Web3 development platform Yeah I think it is SaaS business model So how many clients you have And what's the price you charge for them? Yeah So we have different models You can buy credits Or you can have like SaaS Like you said But currently due to our Being funded by the Polkadot treasury Everything is in freemium So adding new ecosystems And adding new chains to the platform Will be the next step towards Paying clients from other ecosystems What's your pricing plan? We have different pricing from $9.99 to $99.99 per month Depending on the product and support from our team Yeah, and just quickly on the business model for the token itself Why do you need the token? And how does the token accrue value from the platform? So our token is more or less for governance purposes So that developers can guide the platform the way they wish to be done I'm here, Doman Thank you so much Maybe you can continue answering that question later on Apilang We're down to the last three And next is Oneverse Technology Who will be presenting? Well, it's Jason Chong He is the product director at Oneverse Technology Please welcome him Hi, everyone Hello, judges Introducing Oneverse Pay 5 The new virtual economy engine That breached traditional games and web 3 So we started off with gaming As it's a proven industry with high spendings Borderless payments As well as ease of transferable of a digital asset So today, in Oneverse 60% of our gamers are actually transacting with us in USDT With the ever-growing of the gaming industry We are actually introducing Oneverse Pay 5 To serve as a bridge between the traditional gaming and web 3 So today, over the past one year We have achieved 20 million of sales in revenues Whereby 60% of it from USDT And with a market reach of 7 million of communities And we are also connected to more than 100 games As well as 60 payment channels in Southeast Asia and Latin America So here are some of the top games titles that we carry With a global market of the 3 billion And also monthly active gamers of 500 million And we connected to 60 payment channels in the Southeast Asia and Latin America And we actually also do a lot of brand collaboration with the top brands in the Southeast Asia And we further strengthen it with our collaboration with the local speaking influencers Mainly in Southeast Asia as well So over the next three years We are to get ourselves connected to more than 150 games in the regions As well as onboarding 100 million of users to our platform And from there on, we are going to actually convert all these 20 million of mainstream users into Web3 So our token model works based on 1-1 credits The universal currencies within our ecosystems Compliment with governance tokens With a total token supply of 10 billion So just here, just a brief of what we have done over the past one year So we have a market presence in Southeast Asia and Latin America With a local offices in six countries As well as a hit out of 20 million in just a one year of establishments And moving next We are going to actually continue to expand our market presence in different markets And also continue to develop new products As well as achieve 100 million sales of revenues And our core team We are coming with more than 25 years of experience In business and financial planning, payments, as well as compliance Thank you Thank you for your time Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you So you provide a payments, crypto payment solution to let a user can buy game, game asset with fiat or crypto, right? We basically accept both and 60% of it actually is coming from USDT USDT Yes Okay So how do you convert fiat to USDT? The conversion is not done by us But basically our end users, our gamers, they already have the USDT And they just come to our platform to get their purchases with all the different games that they are actually playing But I think the game company, they need fiat, right? Yeah So how do you convert crypto to fiat? Yeah, basically today we are actually paying them in fiat, right? So if you actually want to, basically we have a sufficient cash flow that we can actually pay them in fiat as well Okay Just quickly the revenue numbers that you mentioned, which are quite high, so what's exactly the source of the revenue? So you take a commission on a... The revenue is actually gross revenue, but in our commissions we do have a profit sharing in terms of when we are actually selling on behalf of... or we are actually reaching for the game publishers to all these audience in the market Yeah, and just going back to the token again, so can you explain once again what's the utility for the token? And why do you need it? Yeah, basically I think today all these are our users, they are actually just using our own credit But then we've launched our tokens, basically we can actually encourage more rewards or loyalties as well as the gamers they can enjoy in terms of value appreciation Because it's a supply, we have a consistent supply and demand in our current ecosystems And it brings additional benefit and also additional competition advantage Comparating us and so our competitors Thank you so much Jason, thank you so much just for the question And our next startup, Liquidium He's going to be presenting, Su Xu, Asia Growth Lead Please welcome him on stage Good afternoon everybody, good afternoon Josh I'm Su from Liquidium Liquidium is a leading Bitcoin DeFi app We focus on Bitcoin ecosystem Why do we choose this market? Although the capital market or Bitcoin is much larger than Ethereum The fundable token and ordinals are much smaller So we have huge potential in this market But Bitcoin asset is not as liquid as other ecosystems Imagine that you hold a 10k USD or you know and you want 5k tomorrow But you don't want to sell it, what can you do? Liquidium is born to solve this pain point We are the learning protocol for native Bitcoin assets like ordinals, runes and BRC20 And every transaction is executed on layer 1 to ensure the security and decentralization The platform is very simple to use You just need to select Cardo, click Borrow and it's done The process is similar for both lenders and borrowers We have launched our startup for over 2 years And we have 4 million total funding right now And just last year we completed around 400 million total loan volume 84k loans and we generate 165k revenue per month So what's our business model? The business model is very simple We charge 20% of the interest And from this simple business model we generate 1.6 million last year And unlike most startups, we are already profitable Despite being profitable, we show strong growth in both volumes and loans But we are more ambitious We want to become our way of Bitcoin So here's the roadmap in 2025 We've already delivered customer loans and instant loans And the next quarter we will deliver the biggest products of liquid ever The cross-chain liquid pool So at that time you will be able to borrow BTC against USDT USDC against BTC and much more It won't be achieved with an A-class team Liquidium is funded by 3 crypto-native builders And they were members of Bitcoin Frontier Fund And they are also board members of Liquidium And within one year we grow to 12 people 12 employees from 8 different countries And we do not fight alone We are backed by the leading venture capitals Industry leaders and external advisors That's all for my pitch I hope you enjoy it Thank you Thank you Maybe you can just quickly explain So you mentioned that transactions And sort of everything is settled on a Bitcoin layer 1 So how exactly does that work? Yes Basically we use DLC Just create log contract You can see it as a smart contract on Bitcoin So it's a decentralized and security method Yeah And just quickly on the health of the loans and the LTV and liquidations So how do you sort of manage the risks within these lending pools? Yeah, well we do not Currently we do not use liquidation But we use another mechanism It's default The process is similar You collateralize your house to a bank And you get your loans And if you default The bank will have your house And they can sell it through your house So we do not have liquidation but default Yeah Yeah Thank you Thank you so much Thank you so much Thank you so much to Sushu And the last startup for the semi-finals We have Domi Chain, Rooney Chakravorty He is the Chief Architect The floor is yours Three minutes I'm here to introduce Domi Chain The high performance blockchain fortified by AI and trusted by all Now fast chains are nothing new There's Solana, Sui, Aptos But some of these only have 100 nodes Others can go down for hours They aren't perfect We need a fast chain that's decentralized, secure, and does not go down Introducing Domi The first AI-secured blockchain Now what does AI-secured mean? Well we have two types of nodes First are the core nodes These are your traditional blockchain validators And second are the AI nodes Now the AI nodes They locally run an AI model specifically designed to detect risky events like DDoS and prevent them Now these nodes act as a decentralized firewall protecting the network and averting network disruptions We also enhance our security by storing snapshots of our assets on Bitcoin Which is the gold standard of blockchain security For our core protocol We combine fast Byzantine agreement with Solana's proof of history to achieve high speed and scalability Now fast Byzantine agreement has a self-run lottery mechanism Immediate finality and a very low chance of an adversary attack It's also more scalable than Solana's PBFT As when more nodes join our network our speed does not get diminished We've also developed a Wasm virtual machine Now this supports more languages that developers are already familiar with including Solidity Comparison between us and Solana We have a shorter block time We also have the potential to be more decentralized As our hardware requirements for our nodes are much lower We're more scalable Our fast Byzantine agreement is more scalable And we're much more secure Our AI nodes and Bitcoin snapshotting make us much more secure than Solana We also have a close partnership with a satellite company And in the future using satellites We'll be able to achieve synchronization of all blockchain validators At the same time within the hemisphere Some of our milestones October 31st our test tent went live And as of now we're grateful to have over 2 million users Some of our future milestones is our satellite combination We're currently deploying thousands of AI nodes And we're also talking with some DAP projects Our team, Dr. Jack Ding is our founder and CEO He has 23 years of experience designing high performance solutions for NASDAQ and the World Bank I'm Arunee Chakravorty I have over 8 years of AI model design and deployment And 5 years in the blockchain industry Dr. David Castiel, our VP of satellite He has over 30 years of experience in satellite technology And Dr. Cyrus Lingrode Also has some very impressive credentials to his name Some of the partners we're grateful to be working with And our contact information Thank you Thank you Just quickly on your test net metrics Yeah How many nodes validators you've had on the test net? So we have a couple dozen nodes Yep And the performance metrics that you mentioned Yeah The throughput, the finality, obviously the block time is kind of there But have you done like any tests? Yeah, we've tested them and they're verified Yeah So were they done sort of in a geo-distributed manner or like Sorry, can you repeat that? Were they done in the same region or like geo-distributed? Or global Global, yeah And what were they here again? Like how did you kind of load test the network? We have an explorer and we have multiple ways we can test this And once again, so what exactly is the sort of main benefit of using AI like within the actual network setup? Yeah, so the AI knows they act like a decentralized firewall, they detect network traffic and they analyze the riskiness of transactions You know for a DDoS attack we can detect it before it actually impacts the network and prevent it Yeah, and obviously like for any layer one kind of the main challenge is like once you build it even if it's a high performance and has certain property advantages like over the other networks the main challenge is actually finding the market fit and sort of attracting developers to the platform. I know you mentioned wasm which sort of opens it up to the kind of wider category of the users but how actually going to like integrate it with the existing system or liquidity the development stacks and so forth. Yeah, so we have some cross chain compatibility as well. And of course our wasm is a big feature for us. And we're also talking with some other DAP projects and some integration over there. So we already have DEXs and NFT marketplaces too. Thank you so much. Sorry Vladimir, we have to finish. Thank you so much Rooney and thank you everybody. Thank you to our judges. This concludes the Finals are coming. Thank you so much. This concludes the pre-finals. We are going to have the finals at 3.20 on this stage. So make sure you come back because we are going to announce the finalists.
