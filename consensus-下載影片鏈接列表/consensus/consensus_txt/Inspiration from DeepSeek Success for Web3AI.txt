 First of all, let us welcome our panelists. And why don't you guys introduce yourself and what are you guys busy with and your initial view on the topic that you want to lay the ground for today's conversation. Jodi? Jodi. Yeah, of course. Hi, everyone. Good morning and welcome. I'm head of marketing at Hyperbolic, which is a decentralized AI cloud powering infrastructure for leading household names like Hugging Face, NYU, Cornell, Stanford. And we also power a majority of the crypto AI projects today. Our core offerings today include a GPU marketplace. We also provide inference. So that's AI models. We have about, I think almost 40 models available on our platform today, including DeepSeq. We support the open source AI ecosystem. And so for us, DeepSeq was, you know, music to our ears to hear that we are getting to a place where it's open source AI is getting super close to closed source models. So yeah. And a little bit about me before joining Hyperbolic. I actually worked at Avalanche where I led product marketing. And I also worked at a crypto wallet before that. Jordan, you're in a nice construction outfit. Tell us what you're building. Representing the data builders of public AI. At public AI, we are making it equitable for everybody to contribute their expertise and experience to AI models. We have a full pipeline from sourcing data to verifying it, to applying it to models. And we have all of that backed up with Web3 primitives. So people are doing staking and using reputation systems on chain to be able to verify the quality of the data. Because when you have 500,000 data workers showing up, self-selecting into work, you're going to have variable quality. So we need those Web3 primitives in control of that quality. So I'm myself at public AI, I'm the CMO. So I'm leading the marketing community and supply side efforts. And prior to this, I have been in Web3 for about five years. I was at Near Foundation where I had the honor of working alongside Ilya Polisukin, famous for the Transformers, attention is all you need paper. He and I were working on DAO software that was used to lock up over 2 billion in assets for critical infrastructure projects. And prior to that, I was a technical program manager at Google. And prior to that, I spent over 10 years in advertising, running a digital innovation lab, servicing Fortune 500 companies. Oh, DeepSeek. DeepSeek is very exciting to us. As AI becomes more and more accessible to businesses, there's going to be more and more people figuring out how to bring AI to their businesses and needing to have niche data to be able to do that. What we're seeing is that the data that exists isn't enough to get things up to production quality for these businesses. So going deeper than the publicly available models is the only way to do it. And the diversity that we have with all those data workers is how we can get that. It's the only way really that we see. So we think that it's very exciting. Cheaper technology means it's in more people's hands. It's great for the industry. And it's a killer use case for Web3 to be so well positioned as AI is rising. Thank you. Thank you. Ming. Hello, everyone. I'm Ming Wu. And I'm the co-founder and the CTO of ZeroG. And ZeroG is a project that's a target to provide a scalable decentralized AI infrastructure for the Web3 AI workload. And we're targeting to provide what we call a decentralized AI operating system, which targets to manage the decentralized storage and the computation resources for the applications so that we can easily onboard the AI applications from Web2 to Web3 in a decentralized way. And, of course, we provide very scalable technologies to scale the requirement of the AI workload. And for me, before joining the Web3, I was working in the Microsoft Research Asia for 11 years, mainly research on the distributed system, including all the storage, computation, transaction, and also the AI platform. And later on, I co-founded another blockchain complex with FanLong, which introduced innovative consensus protocol to provide both the high performance and also the high extent of decentralization. And recently, I transferred to the zero G project and because I recently met with our CEO, Michael, and we discussed some new ideas about how to combine AI technology into the blockchain area so that we can have more larger scope of this technology stuff. Yeah. Okay. Maybe this time I ask questions. The other reverse order. So, Ming, as a computer scientist, and, you know, your background remind me a lot of David Ysse, who, you know, initially created the whole Wi-Fi protocol. Now he's doing Bitcoin layer 2, right? Like, what's in your scientist mind? Like, how you see, you know, AI, Web3, like, interact? You see that as a natural expansion of technological advancement? Or you feel that, you know, there is, you know, you more look at that from utility perspective and all that? Because you have a very unique entrepreneurship kind of a journey. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think we see that the AI technology is becoming more and more powerful. And currently, AI intelligence can be compatible to the human brain at many, many areas. And so, we think that just because of this, we think that the centralized AI can have a big problem in the future. Because when we apply such advanced AI technologies in the area that will affect the user daily life, it's very dangerous if we don't know how this AI model is trained and what's the original intention that the AI model can have. So, we do believe that we need some transparency to all the control power about this. So that we can have AI and be more aligned to the human intention value. So, can do good things for the human life. And so, we believe that the decentralized technology provided by the blockchain can be a major help on this kind of mission. Because the blockchain technology makes all the data and the computation more transparent to users. And many of them can be verified in a very way. So, and also with high performance blockchain infrastructure, we can keep track the entire cycle of the AI pipeline from the data ingestion, data cleaning, labeling, and also the model training and inference. The whole cycle we can monitor it. And we can measure the honesty of the entire process. And another issue is that the centralized AI may generate a lot of profit and revenue profit. But the distribution of the reward may not be that fair. Because, for example, the open air actually got a lot of revenue by themselves. But they actually crowd a huge amount of data from the internet. But they don't feedback this reward to those contributors. So, I think we share the same mission with public air maybe. And we think that with this transparency and we have the power to redistribute the revenue generated by the AI to all the contributors from the data and the computation side. So, I think that's the purpose that we built this. We want to combine AI and the crypto. Thank you, Ming. Jordan, when we talk about AI, people focus on three elements, right? Data, computing power, algorithm. So, is it fair to say public AI focuses more on the data side? And if so, how do you see your effort, your achievement, your direction improves efficiencies relative to, say, your peers in Web 2, as we broadly categorize this, say, scale AI or the other guys? So, I guess from this particular segment, would you like to share your insight? Yeah. As you mentioned, people think about compute and data as big bottlenecks for AI. We aren't so concerned with compute. One of the examples that my co-founder, Dr. Steven Wong, likes to make is if you have an AI and you're training it, it's like giving a student a book. If it's a good book, they can look at it for a minute or read it once and it's going to be fine. If you give them a bad book, they can look at it for years and still not learn anything. So, that thinking... Now I realize I have been reading bad books. I've figured out a lot of things in life. Too much doom scrolling. Yeah. And then that's really why our thinking is around the value of data. And it's something that the Web 2 world has seen. Like, that's why the Web 2 giants are so easily able to profit off of the data that they've been pillaging from their users for so long. So, we really have that thinking around the data being the most valuable part. And the real differentiator that Web 3 is able to provide is the diversity. If you are a centralized, top-down company trying to build an AI, you're going to be doing it for a specific use case that's aligned with your interests. And for human diversity to show up and inform those things, you actually need a large set of individual contributors. And that diversity of data is what's going to get you over the hump of kind of the generic slop that we have today. A lot of our clients have some successful experiments with large language models, but they can't get it up to the production-grade reliability of 99 or 99.9% that they need to get these things actually running for their companies. And it's also too expensive to be running large language models for everything. So, by getting the right data, the good books, we're able to train models that are more efficient to run and do so more reliably than just running the large language models. So, that's where we're really providing value and why I think we have, you know, decent revenue to date and are really optimistic about the future. Excellent. Excellent. Charlie, I guess now the question is on your business now. Sounds like you guys are focusing on AI computing cloud. Is that the right description? And if so, relative to those giants that spend, you know, zillions of dollars and zillions of megawatts of power creating this and fearing this AI growth and expansion, what is Hyperbolic is doing and how you're going to disrupt the status quo here? Yeah, of course. I think, you know, Hyperbolic has received a lot of attention because we have entered a space where there are these Web 2 giants. And we kind of looked at the problem similar how to the Deep Seek AI team probably did. We had constraints in front of us, but we thought, you know what, let's do things differently. Let's ditch the middlemen. And that's why also Web 3 really aligns with our core values, which is about transparency, also equitability, ensuring everyone who contributes in our ecosystem is rewarded. But specifically for our business, the way we've been able to differentiate ourselves is just, like I said, ditching the middlemen. So we are a decentralized AI cloud. Our GPU marketplace is one of the many services we offer. And on top of that, we have these inference models, like I also told you about. And what we're able to do is with these two specific services, we cut costs by 75%. We also have a platform that is fully private. So that's really important for developers, for example, who want to access Deep Seek, but don't want to send their data back. And so it's a serverless platform. And because the platform itself is also really easy to use, we have gained attention from, like, OpenAI's co-founder who left OpenAI. And he was also the previous director of Tesla AI, Andre Carpathia, one of the biggest names in the Web 2 world. So, yeah, I think just our ethos is to democratize AI access, push AI's evolution forward, and, yeah, rethink the ballgame. Super. Yeah. We're here at a consensus in Hong Kong to celebrate Web 3, celebrate crypto and the blockchain, right? But what I've experienced is that every single time we say, okay, here we have the solution and the future, then there is always disruption out there, right? Deep Seek is the disruption, right? For us here in Asia, in Hong Kong in particular, we probably don't have access to OpenAI without VPN and all that. Now here we are, something cheaper, arguably better to a certain extent, and more accessible. So what do you think, you know, as an entrepreneur, as, you know, focusing the talents, focusing this space, you know, what do you value the most? Is it the efficiency, right? Is it the access? Is it the, you know, the censorship proof? You know, other things that you try to distinguish from the centralized business rather than the Web 3 kind of business you guys are building on? So probably, do you have to? Yeah, of course. So, yeah, Deep Seek's a great example for us of why open source AI is so valuable. I think for us, you know, there's a couple of things that arise as like an AI cloud, right? Of course, they were able to train the model with less GPUs available, but they were only able to do that because of the constraints that were given to them. They decided they wanted to create a completely new algorithm for reinforcement learning. And so I think for us, when we see that kind of innovation, it excites us because it also allows builders now to go and build agents, applications, whatever that may be. And we like to say, take your wildest dreams, hyperbolic, right? Like we want you to be able to build whatever you want and not have to think about the costs, the scalability, if the model works, if the platform works. Like we want to strip that away for all the developers. And that's how we've been able to garner over 100,000 developers today in the Web 2 world building on hyperbolic. And we're excited to continue to expand that in the Web 3 space. And like I said, we power a majority of the crypto AI projects today, including some of the most popular agents that you might know, like Virtuals Protocol, Zero Bro, Eliza. The list goes on. So Lang, Arc, there's a ton. And the reason they trust us is because we have a platform that works, that's live. And yeah, it's just easy to use. Okay. So what I hear is open source, open access. Exactly. Super. Jordan? Yeah. For us, the access is key. When more people have access to AI, it means more clients for us. More organizations are figuring out how this technology applies to their businesses. So it's a very healthy thing to see it so available globally. As far as the efficiency goes, DeepSeek was able to do what they did because they had access to good data. As a quantitative trading firm, they were sitting on years of data that allowed them to very quickly train up a model. And also take advantage of synthetic data along the way. At public AI, we don't think that you need a human in the loop for every single step. There's efficiencies to be able to do that. There's efficiencies to be had by using synthetic data for some steps, using AI for certain decision making, etc. But there are edges where humans still matter. And that's where we're capturing value is around those edges where human input and human output are the most valuable things. And that's why we're able to actually make it equitable for people to participate in this future where AI is here. It's not coming. It's here. And another touch point on access is we were talking earlier, mentioning the fact that AI can be centralized or decentralized or maybe even autonomous. We see it as a gradation where the centralized AI is always going to be in private interest, so it will never be for the people. If we care about humans, we care about people, it has to at least be decentralized where through voting or their own data and interest and expression, they can show up in these models. Our human things that make us human are our languages, our interests, everything shows up in the models. And that decentralization is an essential step for if we get to autonomous, which is still kind of sci-fi. But if we want human values to show up in autonomous, it has to come from people. Otherwise, we will have private interests that are autonomous and those aren't going to be putting people first. So we really see it as part of the essence of our mission and vision to make sure that humans are represented in these models through their data. Decentralization, autonomy, human existence. Excellent. Let's go. Let's go, yeah. Me? I also think that the DeepSea technology actually provides opportunities for people to deploy AI training and inference in the decentralized setup. So basically, because it requires less resources, so that can more easily leverage the decentralized computation power. And also, you know, previously, we were actually working on addressing a lot of challenges to deploy the AI training in decentralized situation. Because in the decentralized situation environment, the network bandwidth is very constrained. And if we use that environment to train a very large scale model, it's kind of not realistic. But currently, I think with the advancement of DeepSea technology, it makes this decentralized AI pipeline more practical. So I think that's a good thing. Another thing that I think DeepSea provides is that it actually changed the way that the competition of the model training. For example, because it actually shows the power of the reinforcement learning, drives the exploration of the reasoning process of the model. So that's it actually, so I think this is the key technology that allows we shrink the model size to have the same level of intelligence of the model. So I think this actually, so previously, there's no way for the startup and the small group to compete with the large-gen, like OpenAI, right? Because they need a lot of huge amount of resources. Who owns the large amount of GPUs will definitely win. But currently, I think the situation changed a little bit because people are actually thinking how to invent some new reasoning framework to exploit the most value of the model intelligence there. So that means that a small team and more talented people can have more power to contribute in this area. So I think this makes the competition more extensive and more fair in this market. Right. Sounds like the open source, open knowledge base, the open society concept coupled with Web3 participation is the way, at least, to make progress. Yes. When I got the assignment to moderate this panel, I did ask DeepSeek about what would be the inspiration from DeepSeek's successful Web3 AI. And the smart DeepSeek that we have talked about for the past 20 minutes give the following answer. And I want you to hear this and see whether you agree, whether you would add on those. Would that be the focus for you as an entrepreneur or for business? So that includes 10 things. Bear with me, guys. So data-driven decision-making, scalability performance, user-centric design, security privacy, collaboration, ecosystem building, continuous innovation, regulatory compliance, community engagement, interoperability, ethical AI practice. I feel a lot of this is AI try to fill in 10 points. But, you know, pick any one of these things that kind of echoes with your what do you think about AI, about DeepSeek in general. And probably elaborate that and share with the audience. Yeah. Beautiful. I think at Hyperbolic what really aligned with us was the efficiency. So as I mentioned before, now there are multiple areas that ourself as a business can start to think about. So not only do we have the compute inference, we also have an agent framework that allows for developers to tap into our compute as well as our inference and begin to create agents that can scale, self-replicate, and run autonomously. And so these, I think this part of the business is really exciting because now people will have more money to focus on other areas other than just worrying about the availability of compute and also the cost of the inference model. So I think that's probably the one that aligns most with us. Yeah. Yeah. What about, say, the security and compliance part? Yeah. You guys are in US. Oh, all of you guys are. But, you know, what's your angle, you know, how you see that fitting, you know, the current environment, I guess, regulatory-wise? Yeah. You know, it's funny. There is definitely a, we actually wrote an article about this the other day. There's obviously the cultural alignment and cultural shift that has happened. And I think we celebrate the fact that this did come out of a constrained environment. And whether or not it came from the US or not doesn't matter to us as long as it's moving open source. No, people actually talk about it. We're from US and all that now. Right. That's right. So, yeah, that's a plus, I guess. Yeah, it's a plus for us. And I think the great thing, too, about having platforms like Hyperbolic and other decentralized platforms is that, and ones that also prioritize privacy, is that you do have options out there to build without being worried about sending your data to the wrong place. So, at Hyperbolic, if you were to tap into our APIs, they're serverless, and they're fully private, so you don't have to worry about that. Got it. Thank you. Yeah, cool. Jordan? Yeah, from my perspective, I think that the UX angle is especially interesting because that was kind of the tipping point where we went from, oh, GPT is kind of a cute, interesting computer science kind of thing, to, oh, everybody can suddenly chat with it, and it makes sense, and people understand why this is so powerful. So, UX is a critical point, and to be able to iterate on UX quickly with AI in the loop means that, for us, our clients are learning what this could mean for their businesses easier, so we're able to service them easier. They understand how it fits easier. We can use AI in that loop. And then, from the other UX point of view, there isn't one point of alignment for AI because there isn't one point of alignment for humans, and that is the beauty of humans is that we are diverse, and that's why it's amazing when we bring people together from different countries and see competition between them. It can be seen as negative, but it's actually healthy for everything moving forward together. So, whenever I hear people trying to reach one point of alignment for AI, that's always a concern for me, and that's why for AI to be meaningful and for it to be accessible to everybody, we need decentralized inputs to this, and to run decentralized and for it to make money for people in a decentralized way. Otherwise, it's meaningless to humans, so Web3 is the only way to drive AI forward in an equitable way that we can see. Thank you. Yeah, so I want to add some comments on the regulatory compliance aspect. So, I think the key to help on this kind of thing is to give the AI or agent the ID and all the ownership, and also the ownership. So, the ID actually may give this agent a responsibility, and the ownership may give the agent some access control stuff. So, by doing this, actually, this is also relevant to some stuff that we are working on in Zero-G. So, basically, we think that the way to achieve that is to combine, to bond the agent with specific NFT so that it can have the on-chain identification and also have the ownership to some wallet address of users. And, but, we realized that it cannot use the traditional standard NFT, the current standard of NFT because the agent data, which could be the model, the memory, and the character, are valuable data. And, it should not be maintained in a public way so that we need to introduce some privacy-preserving technology around it. And, so, this gives us a challenge that how we can design NFT protocol that allows the enable to transfer with this privacy data. So, that's, to achieve that, we propose a new NFT standard that we call iNFT, intelligent NFT, and with an innovative protocol that allows the users to transfer this valuable private agent model, agent data. And, also, we are going to work on the marketplace on top of this technology so that we can have the OpenSea counterpart in the agent world. Nice. So, we are approaching the end of the panel. So, very quickly for each of every one of you. So, what would be the question you ask AI when you try a new AI agent or, you know, when you invite folks to try your apps or try your site? What would be that one question? Jodi? Sorry, could you clear that up a bit more? No, like, you know, guess what's the weather today? You know, what would be the stock, you know, where Bitcoin is going to be next month? What would be that single one question you want to ask AI about? I don't know if you guys have tried this, but if you ask how many R's are in strawberry, I usually get that one wrong. Okay. Jordan? Redacted. I always read Team B censorship resistibility. Yeah. Cool. So, I often use the AI for translation. Yeah. I guess we all read, most of us read, what's that, Hitchhack's Guide to Galaxy? Yeah. Ultimate Question 42. So, with that, we end this panel. And, wow. For us, happy trading for you guys. Happy AI development. Amen.
