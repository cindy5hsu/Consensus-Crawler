INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('08882c6a63', 'Views from Wall Street to Crypto', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' I''m Tira Gray, Managing Director of CoinDesk Events, and it''s truly a pleasure to welcome you and our very first session, which could not be more appropriate to start the day with, from Wall Street to crypto. We have three esteemed Wall Street veterans joining us today for this opening session. It is my pleasure to welcome them to the stage. Good morning, gentlemen. You can hear me okay? Yes. We''ve been running with our jet lag, and we''re going to try to take this down as articulately as we can under the sleep-deprived circumstances. So you all had a tremendous career on traditional Wall Street before pivoting into crypto, and I thought it would be really fun for the audience to kind of hear what was your aha moment. So Mike, let''s start with you. Lifelong career on global market infrastructure. It makes sense that the market structure potential of crypto would be an obvious opportunity. What was your moment? Where did you see this future? Yeah, it came over time. I think it''s fair to say I saw fragmentation for my entire life. And when you start scaling a proposition in financial markets, you naturally hit boundaries on how you can bring a product, an idea to the next region, to the next markets, and how to embrace the next group of clients. And my pivotal moment was when I really understood the impact of technology on where the planet is going in terms of computational power connectivity, and realizing how important liquidity is in driving sentiment into the right direction and driving adoption. So it came over a few years that I realized, okay, there is a big opportunity, equally slash challenge to get this right. and to really gain a global perspective on how financial markets could look like in the future. Terrific. So I''m going to go to your class. Cajimo Feroilández. in the future. Terrific. Fabio, I''m going to go to you next. You ran Abraxas for, founded Abraxas. 16 years in, you had a moment thinking, wait, we need to pivot to digital assets. How did this happen? Thank you for the question because you know already the answer. For me, instead of over time, it was just one day. One day I was on a plane from Milan to London and I had an EasyJet magazine in front of me. And apologies for what I''m saying, but there was a beautiful picture of a very nice girl actually. And I was looking at the picture and then I saw Ethereum Foundation. So I started to read the article and on that basis actually I got involved in finance. Sorry, finance in crypto. That was my moment. Then as soon as I landed, that afternoon I met a guy that was doing arbitrage on sterling euro between two exchanges. And I was faber-glassed by the spread. I used to be working with less than a basis point spread on the swap market and the guy was talking about percentage points. And that was back in 2017, early 2017. And then, yeah, in the evening I was out for dinner with somebody else. I was involved again in crypto and in the night I couldn''t sleep. So the morning after I started to study the crypto market. So that was my moment. Serendipity played a role, it sounds like. Yes, correct. Gautam, you covered fintech investing your whole career. So I certainly think that that experience lent itself to this, but could you define what was the moment that it all clicked for you? Yeah, sure. So I come from a web to tech investing background prior to getting into crypto. For me, it happened in two stages. Stage one was one of my very close friends wanted to start a company where you start to match resume to people''s profile on LinkedIn, but couldn''t do it and failed because couldn''t access the database of LinkedIn. It was restricted. So when he got into Ethereum, he introduced that concept to me. And I found it very powerful that you can have like open databases to access and then people can build on each other''s work. So that was fascinating. And I think stage two was generally if you look at most of the web two companies, a lot of value accrues based on network effects. So whether it''s Facebook, Google and others. And when I learned about the process of how you transfer ownership to users, and then on the back of it, you build a network. So the power of network effects, I could see it play out in this new tech stack. So that was another kind of aha moment for me. When I combined those two, it was very clear to me that, you know, we need to take technology from just putting lipstick fintech versus really reinventing the tech stack for financial services. And making it, I think it ultimately, we''re not there yet, more accessible for all users. Exactly. And not this esoteric asset class. So let''s go backwards now. I''ll start with you again, Gautam. I would love to know where, let''s start with the positive. What are the frictions in today''s market that we are unanimously agreeing that crypto does solve for? And then we''re going to obviously go to the other side of that. Where is it not succeeded yet? But let''s start with the positive. So I run Brevenhauer Digital, which is a crypto asset management platform. This is a 24-7 asset class. You need to be able to move assets from dollars into crypto and out of that, literally weekends, weekdays, all the time. I think that is a new concept, if you will, for traditional finance. In fact, sometimes we run across this problem where we still have to interact with traditional finance institutions. And sometimes you have trouble on weekends to move from traditional rails to crypto rails, right? So I think that''s kind of a big shift that''s happened with crypto, where it''s 24-7 and accessible to anyone at any point in time. I do agree. The big shift is really like this idea that it never stops. So it''s trading all the time. It is fascinating from a certain point of view. It''s challenging as well. As he was saying, when you have a mismatch, especially if you are involved, like we are involved as well at Abrax and ACACC curve between moving assets from traditional, so the banking system into the crypto and out all the time because our strategy is based on arbitrage. And sometimes it''s quite challenging. It''s quite challenging. So you have to be creative as well and to find ways on accommodating this big difference. But it''s fascinating. When you get involved, you cannot get enough, I have to say. And Mike? Yeah. So moving assets and moving liquidity is music to my market-making ears. So our mission really is in making that a reality. And I think what''s increasingly clear to us is that the asset pool will significantly increase over the next five, ten years. So then we come back to what are the use cases in DeFi and digital assets that really attract and accelerate institutional adoption and then down the road also in retail adoption. And I feel one key element for us as a market maker and liquidity provider is getting this right technologically. And this hopefully creates not just resilience but also trust and confidence. And this is then in my mind the key to the door which you need to make wide open to really bring regulators in big institutional players that trust the system and also understand the benefits of what we claim will be the future coexistence between TreadFi and digital assets and DeFi. And we are not there yet. And we are also not there yet as we are basically embracing a bunch of use cases where question mark could be put on how does that work out from a synergy perspective and how do we want to bring that to the next level. I feel this is also about transparency and alignment. And then next to that I talked about the technological side. If you just embrace the idea that computational power will increase significantly over the next five to ten years, the next five to ten years, then you are a bit back in a big data game because with digitization the planet will earn and get more data and that feeds them back into risk allocation models. And if you believe in it, I think the road into driving better decisions should be there. And what I learned from the TreadFi side is if that is true, then you will have a significant impulse in terms of volume increases. So I''m dreaming a bit about getting this technological layer right, creating interoperability and connectivity and then go from there. It''s amazing to hear big data starting to come back again. I thought that was dead about seven years ago and here we are back to big data. We''ve recreated it in a different shape. We''ve also recreated how risk and return works in this space. And I think this is a really important thing for retail investors to understand and anyone who''s looking this space. We can''t use traditional risk return models, I don''t think. And I''m going to let you guys tell us if that''s the case. But I would like to know specifically what should we be maintaining from traditional finance and how we look at risk and return? And then where should we be shifting to a new lens? What part of the market? So let''s go backwards. Mike, I''ll go back to you. Yeah, so I''m a big supporter of getting risk right. And when I just see how we build our crypto and digital assets business at Flow Traders, we very much focused on building an end-to-end control layer. And what we realized is this is not by taking what you build from an infrastructure perspective on the TreadFi side and just tweaking it a bit. So you just need to go back to a 24-7 mindset. How do you operate markets around the world non-stop? And how do you treat risk internally? And this is not just about risk allocation. It''s really about market risk and counterparty risk and credit risk. So if you put that all together, you just need a very high functioning machine in order to get that right. But once it''s there, right, you embrace really the benefits of digital assets adoption. And that''s a bit the way where I hope the planet will go. Davio? Yeah, I agree. And also I would add, like, for us, when we do arbitrage, the counterparty risk is the most important one. You have to think that whatever is very traditional finance, you can apply, obviously, on the crypto ecosystem. But, you know, because the crypto ecosystem is still an unregulated, you know, bunch of operators and players around, actually, is actually, I mean, the people here are probably all regulated, actually, but the one on the other side are not. So, you know, counterparty risk, credit risk is very, very important. At the same time, you know, like in our business specifically, we really use trust test because there are some idiosyncrasies, idiosyncrasies, actually, cities of a crypto ecosystem, like, that it does not really operate exactly as a traditional finance. Like, the tweet he was talking about, for me, I''ll just make an example, is like, perpetual futures, initial margin. I mean, initial margin in traditional finance, you don''t lose them when you get stopped. In, actually, in crypto market, you do. You lose the variation and the one. So if you''re involved in business trading, this kind of activity, it''s very, very important to, you know, to simulate stress testing scenario, having all the possibilities in front of you, and that is a bit challenging. But, yeah, it can be done. I mean, if you''re done properly, it is quite, it''s quite rewarding, I would say. And Gautam, how do you have to say to that? Look, we, we see risk management as not very dissimilar from traditional finance, in the sense that if you think of the various forms of risk, right, there''s market risk, there''s credit risk, there''s counterparty risk, there''s technology risk. All these risks exist in crypto as well. It''s just the extent is quite different versus traditional finance. So in traditional finance, you don''t think about counterparty risk as much, right? So you''re trading with the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley here, you''re literally pre-funding exchanges. You have to think about exchanges, you know, the risks that associate with, like, putting assets on exchanges. So that''s kind of one risk. The second risk, which is different, is really the technology risk, right? Smart contract risk. So if you''re providing liquidity to liquidity pools, you have to think about those risks. So that''s different. Having said that, there are a lot of principles that we still use from traditional finance, especially as it relates to market risk. So one of the things we focus a lot on structuring trades with a risk reward framework that''s attractive. And the concepts are very similar, right? So you will look for option structures. And to be honest, option markets is pretty deep now, across Bitcoin and ETH especially, right? So use some of those concepts there. In addition to that, you also look at risk reward, even when you invest in early stage projects or so-called venture projects, but they tend to be liquid. So in a way, those are almost like options where you effectively invest at a lower valuation and expect, you know, multiples return, but you can potentially lose half of that. So some of those market risk principles are still applicable even in crypto. Do you feel like that we are creating, I mean, obviously, I know how this solves everything, and it certainly hits on a lot of traditional pain points that we had on Wall Street for many, many years. But it does feel like at times we''re creating a new ecosystem that''s going to come with a whole new vulnerability and it''s not covered enough, particularly I''m thinking for the end user here and the retail investor. To be fair and honest, you''re like, where is the new risk that if you were advising someone new to look at the space who''s investing in it, what is the new risk that we are creating? And it might be solved in the near future. But what is it right now? Look, the biggest shift, if you will, is the fact that crypto and digital assets is all about no intermediary, right? That''s kind of the end goal or let''s say the ideal answer. Here in traditional finance, you are always dependent on an intermediary, whether it''s a prime broker or a bank. So you can pinpoint any kind of issue and pass on the risk to that counterparty. Here, you know, it''s all algorithm. It''s all technology. So some of those risks you have to manage yourself and you can''t really outsource some of that risk. So the capabilities that you need to build in-house is different from that perspective. So the role of technology in risk management, I would say, is far higher in crypto versus traditional finance. Yeah, I agree entirely. On top of that, I mean, from a point of view of a retailer that actually gets involved in it, sometimes it is for granted, actually, that on the other side there is somebody that is a good actor. And here, unfortunately, it is sometimes it''s not actually. So, you know, the kind of knowledge you need to have properly, you know, the checks that you need to make. I''m just thinking about DeFi specifically, like, you know, a smart contract risk if it''s been audit, not audit. So these are concepts that normal people don''t really know what we are talking about. So they actually log in, they think is safe, and they trade without really thinking too much. They think that on the other side, you have, I don''t know, the same as the normal traditional finance, but it''s not. It''s not because everybody can actually create a protocol, put it on a blockchain, they just create a smart contract, and, you know, and maybe you have a back door to take all the money out. So there is massive risk there. And, you know, we are still, you know, eventually, we''re going to get better, because good actor, obviously, we''re going to be pushed out and the good and the good one, we''re going to stay, we''re going to get bigger, we''re going to attract liquidity, people like Mike will help them actually to get more liquidity. And eventually, you know, like people will just trade on base, and we just leave the other one apart. And I think everyone thinks, oh, crypto is going to come in, and it''s trustless and permissionless, and it''s fixing everything for me, and I don''t need to learn anything, I can just start doing it. At the end of the day, you''re still an investor, it''s up to you to do your own research. There''s always risk when you''re making an investment into any asset class, let alone a brand new one. I want to read you guys a quote that I read last week. It''s a CIO of a very large US pension fund. I was surprised by this. He said blatantly in an interview, quote, he did not see cryptocurrency as an institutionally investable asset class, because it''s low adoption among his peers and allocators, I would argue, that''s the wrong way to think about that. But I do think he is touching on something, despite the enthusiasm, particularly the tailwinds that we''re seeing right now post US election, the institutional investors are not here. And to be fair, I want to make sure we''re all on the same page with that term. Pension funds, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, they are not here yet. What is it going to take? When is this moment going to happen? What needs to evolve? And I''m going to start with you, Mike. Yeah, I mean, the entire dynamic around how do you need to look into the global asset pool? How do you find yields? I think the bridge mentally into embracing digital assets is a very unique opportunity to increase the size of the global asset pool by trillions of US dollars. And then I come down to what you said on how do we create trust credibility. So the way we look at it, providing end to end liquidity in a very reliable fashion, and also as a regulated house, very much in line with global regulation, I think that is the key thing to get right. But I also would like to just add, if you look into cryptocurrencies in isolation, this is not doing the trick in order to get it right. So I mean, there are figures out there indicating that by 2030, the global tokenization, a tokenized pool of real world assets goes up to 30 trillion US dollars. I think this is quite a big number. But if you believe in that number, even just remotely, you will understand that we are building a full ecosystem that is end-to-end optimized. And I feel then you need to embrace the value creation chain more broadly. So you need to talk about the custody function, the settlement function, the relevance of data needs to come in. And then you basically start understanding that we are not talking about cryptocurrencies in isolation, but about digitizing the planet. And the fragmentation I mentioned at the beginning in traditional financial markets, maybe it''s just, if I''m critical, fair to say we just got used to it and accepted it and built incumbent infrastructure to just relate to it. But the reality is that if you believe in real-time settlement and the availability of technological solutions to move liquidity in real-time from one asset class to another across regions, I mean, this is just a significant step up in efficiency and effectiveness. And that should be the discussion. Which are key terms for any conversation with an institutional investor. So it is peculiar that that has not resonated more firmly yet. Fabio, what do you think it takes? Fabio, what do you think? I agree with Mike. On top of that, I would say that, I don''t know if it works with the microphone. I would say that I think, you know, the gentleman was talking about not investable asset. I mean, you have to, they think at the moment, most of the institution, they think like crypto is a gigantic casino where it is just trading and it''s really no value under that. Well, you can actually choose Bitcoin as digital gold, this kind of, you know, and they stop there. But the reality of fact is exactly what he said. I mean, it''s like behind, there is like a gigantic revolution taking place and there is value to be extracted investing in some specific project or whatever that will actually have abnormal return compared to the traditional assets where normally they are invested. But the issue here is like also, there is a gigantic like issue that is like the people that are managing this big institution, I''m sorry to say that older, and they don''t, they don''t really want to start learning, put their heads down. It''s very difficult actually to study this stuff to try to understand because they''re sitting there and they don''t, they don''t, they don''t feel in a rush. They, you know, they, the guy was talking about his peers. His peers are not doing anything, he''s doing anything. Eventually, a new guy will come, we start investing, he will, you know, they will lag behind, so we''ll be forced actually to get into it. But it''s, to me, it''s inevitable that eventually they will enter and they will actually leave apart this idea that it''s a gigantic casino where people trade in and out and whatever and, you know, and, but it''s value actually to be extracted. Gautam, I would love to hear your perspective on this too. Look, I wouldn''t blame the person who made that comment. To some extent, the signal to noise ratio in this asset class is not great, especially when it comes to how this industry is covered from outside in. And there are, you know, it''s a new technology, right? And there are fringe use cases. People used to say the same thing for internet back in, what, in 1990s and 2000s, right? So you had Amazon, which corrected 96% at one point. So I don''t blame someone looking at it from outside in. Having said that, the way we think about it and the advice we give to our investors is that, look, this is, this is an asset class where you should definitely dabble in. The reality is over the last 17, 18 years, it''s gone to three plus trillion dollars in market cap. So it''s not nothing burger. So there is something going on there. But in order for you to really appreciate what''s going on, you need to invest in this space a much smaller amount that you''re willing to lose. But that gives you an opportunity to learn about this asset class much closer and much deeper. And then you will start to see the potential of it, right? There are applications that are getting built on this, which are generating revenue in hundreds of millions of dollars with much lower FTE count. The number of people involved to build an application is much lower than traditional Web2 stack. So there''s value to it. But it takes time for applications that we are all familiar with to actually come on these rails and then you can use it. We''re starting to see that with payments, stable coins, real world asset tokenization. But I would say, I don''t think media covers it in the right way from that perspective. That should change. And I mean, this is a little controversial question, but do you think, are we far enough where FTX is in the rear view mirror for these institutional investors that they''ve been able to reset what''s been built since and the safety nets that have been put in since and the kind of cleansing that we had? Do you think we are we past that yet? Are we still paying the price for it? We have come a long way. If you haven''t completely passed that phase, as recent as last week, there have been some incidences already and more in the DeFi side of things on the meme coin front. But I would say that the industry has come a long way. You have traditional players who have come into the space. Now, especially for us, most of our trading happens off exchange settlement where you actually keep your assets on custodians while you are able to trade on exchanges. So the technology has come far ahead in terms of the last 18 months since then. There''s more work to be done. Yes, there''s always more work to be done. Okay, we are definitely light on time. So we''re going to fly through these last couple of questions before we get to our speed round. We have to cover centralized exchanges. Mike, give the audience your take. Where is the value of these? Where is the risk? How should people think of centralized exchanges in about 30 seconds? Yeah, I was just about to add. So FDX for me is a call for action, not just for now, but also for the future. When we believe in driving innovation into use cases and transforming the entire infrastructure, if you will, and the way even institutional and retail investors will invest, then I feel we need to make sure that that innovation A becomes super transparent so that investors have a clue of what we are trying to improve and transparency about the benefits. And benefits are, talked about settlement, but availability of data and moving liquidity without fragmentation around it. And as a market maker, I should be quite vocal about price discovery. So getting the best price and giving you a possibility to transact whenever you want to, I think that is a key ingredient. And the last point on data I want to make is, we feel data is perfect, but the reality from TreadFi is the data world is not perfect. Even the data that is available is not perfect in order to feed risk return models. If you believe in digitization, then there is a purifying effect on data quality, and that should massively impact the quality of investing. And it will trickle down from the institutional side into the retail world. So that''s very much a belief I would like to carry forward. Okay, I cannot believe... Oh, sorry, go ahead, Fabian. Sorry. So are you pro-centralized exchange or not? Well, I''m basically decentralized in a way that you need to basically fight fragmentation to make sure that you create interconnectivity and in a way also connectivity across all the different markets. And that is simply possible now with looking into technological advancement and making sure that you''re connecting all the different markets. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, I didn''t get it. Okay. We''re going to rapid fire speed round here. These truly have to be one or two word answers to keep the integrity of this speed round. So what''s the next Solana? Mike? So I would like to... Two words, two words. So I''m quite excited about our stablecoin project, All Unity. I don''t want to do any marketing, but I very much believe that Europe has a fair chance to embrace a stablecoin in order to accelerate digital adoption. Aptos. Wow. Good shout out. Next Solana is Solana. Say it again. It''s Solana. Solana is the next Solana. Okay. I like that. All right. Bitcoin. Is it going to decouple from the rest of crypto? Yes or no? I don''t think so. Yes. It already has. There we go. Three perspectives. That''s the point of this panel. Finish this sentence in one or two words. Meme coins are? A threat to long-term innovation and adoption. Should be banned. Good to battle test the crypto rails. Perfect. Ready? Public or private blockchain? Public. Public. Public. Public. There we go. On that one, unanimous. Okay. This is my favorite one. I left it best for last. When we used to all, I think we''re all up here, remember using CDs to play music and we thought, oh, this is it. Music will never get better than on a CD. We used to use a rotary phone to make a phone call. We thought, this is all we need. We''re sitting here today, 2025. Take yourselves five years into your future and your careers. What are we going to look back on in this year thinking, oh, that''s what crypto used to do then. Those are the old ways of doing it. So what''s going to be, that''s new now, old in five years? I very much bring it down to the end user experience of investing. I think we fully underestimate the impact on our lives with this. Yeah, I like the idea of, you know, the new way of investing, but I will probably be on an island doing nothing. So I will not probably be here. Thank you, Gatsang. Paying gas fees for everything we do. There we go. Okay. Past, present, future, Wall Street to crypto. Here we go. Thank you, everyone.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.135', NULL, 'https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-investing-in-digital-assets-macro-panel-33', '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');
INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('422ee7ab80', 'Why Sui Will Eat The World', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Adni Abiodun All right, my name is Adni Abiodun. I''m one of the co-founders of a company called Mr. Labs. We are the primary contributors to a protocol called the 3 blockchain that''s been live for a matter of about 18 months. We set up the company Mr. Labs to build infrastructure and we felt there was a fundamental problem with the internet. We had opportunities of building infrastructure, Facebook, Google and other large companies and we felt that we''re reaching a point of mass centralization with the internet. Companies are now in a position to own your data, follow you wherever you go, decide to de-platform you whenever they don''t like whatever you do, ultimately make decisions, become judge or executioner based on your data, based on their own preference, and also app stores charging 30% revenue share for products that you build, which ultimately isn''t fair. So the internet is built in such a way where it encourages really centralized behavior and our goal as a company is to change that with a bunch of platforms and protocols that we''re going to build for years and years to come. So SWE is a solution for that. If you think about SWE, what is SWE? And people like to use the words layer one, layer two. SWE is beyond that. It is a global coordination layer. It''s a layer that''s going to allow you to reach agreements across a broad spectrum of assets and broad spectrum of APIs. We believe in the future everybody''s going to be offering a bunch of public APIs. You need a layer that allows you to coordinate the movement of assets between any public API in a very atomic and seamless way. That is a problem SWE is looking to solve. It just somehow you can call that a blockchain, but we believe the targetable, addressable market of solving that problem is way, way larger than what we''re talking about in crypto. So the promise of Web3 is really self-custody. The promise of crypto is really being able to have your own user controls and the ability to coordinate what users want to do intently across the Internet. That is what Web3 promises. And we think the Internet cannot deliver that promise. Web3, married with some amazing technologies that we''re building, will give you those opportunities to solve them. So SWE being a coordination layer, I want to tell you a bit about my team. I''m one of the co-founders. My name is Adinia Björdin. We have George Denizes, who is our chief scientist. Sam Blackshare invented the Move programming language while he was at Meta. We also have Chalkius, who is our cryptographer. So you see the team''s very different from a traditional Web3 company. We''re not all skilled in one thing. Our skill base broadens. It goes very, very broad across programming languages. Evan, who led the R&D team at Facebook, also is an ACM computer science winner who worked on LLVM. So the skill set goes from distributed systems, cryptography. It goes to programming languages. It goes to system design. It goes to product. We believe you need all these amazing skill sets to actually build cohesive infrastructure in Web3, not just one skill set. So we talk about elasticity rather than scalability. Web3 likes to talk about scalability a lot, but really what matters is elasticity. What does that mean? It means as the demands increase for a platform, for a given platform, you can increase the supply. Web3 is built in a way of scarcity, namely as you have more and more transactions, you just hike up the fees and everyone pays more, which isn''t really fair, which means you get penalized for success. And it might not even be your success. It could be a competitive success. It leads to higher fees for everybody else. SWE is built in a way in which we build search at Google and we build infrastructure at large organizations. So as you have more demand for block space in SWE, validators can add more machines, and the more machines you have in the network, the higher the throughput. So there''s theoretically no maximum throughput for SWE because we can add capacity dynamically over time. Separately, there are a number of technologies that just make SWE a pleasure to build on. For example, Move programming language is one of the clearest innovations. This was built after looking at a number of programming languages at Meta, and we found that there was no real comparison for what you could do. If you want to have a world where money is programmable and you want ultimate safety, EVM isn''t the way. Building a solidity is just not the way. And having people trust in just building in Rust is not going to allow you to onboard a lot of developers very quickly. And affording developers to have to know the underworkings of a platform really is a barrier to entry. So Move is one of the easiest languages to learn. It''s actually object-based. Developers are learning Move programming language in about three to four days. We have comments that it''s a 10x performance improvement in trying to build on Solana, for example. The other one is EK Login, where the chain itself will validate your session with OpenID Authenticator. So if you want to control your wallet with Google, you want to control it with Facebook, you want to control it with any service that uses OpenID, the chain itself will validate your session using what we call zero-knowledge proofs. DK Login is probably the most widely adopted consumer implementation of zero-knowledge proofs today. And then finally, we have a standard called kiosks. We heard about the idea of enforcing royalties. Creators were promised that platforms like blockchains will give you the ability to set rules around assets and control royalties and ensure that creators can keep earning their rewards over time. Well, kiosks is actually the only standard of Web3 that helps you really enforce those rules. So you can set really complex enforcement rules, like you can only trade this asset if you have a number of tokens. You can only trade this asset if it''s a particular day and time of the year. You can only trade this asset if you''re part of a particular club or membership. So you can set really, really complex rules around ownership, which is what you really want for digital assets. Again, the account model to a large degree is a bit of a failure for Web3. The world doesn''t work on the basis of accounts. Developers are used to the concept of objects. In SWE, the smallest unit of computation is a strongly typed object. So you can actually build really complex rules and logic in SWE. You build an object, and that object can come with some rich set of rules, which we call intelligent assets. So you have an object that you build, and then you have a smart contract written and move that governs the rules around the object. Who can transfer that asset? How many of those should be in supply? What are the minting strategies required for the asset? Who is a KYC credential required for transfer or minting? So you can really set really complex rules around these assets that we think is very, very difficult to do in other traditional systems to a large degree. That''s what differentiates SWE. And if you compare the code for writing a DEX in SWE versus EVM, for example, you find that it''s probably somewhere in the region of four to five times less verbose writing in SWE than writing on EVM or Solidity. And finally, coordination. In a world where everybody''s going to be offering their products and services via public APIs, you need a way to actually tie these APIs together in a very atomic way. So we have a system called PTBs in SWE. It''s a paradigm that lets you coordinate any number of API calls together and execute them atomically. So if I want to build a super app, I want to book a flight. At the same time, I want to pay for my meals. And at the same time, I want to pay for an excursion on doing a trip. Those can be all different APIs offered publicly, but PTBs tie it together to make it happen atomically. So you can build amazing super apps in a world where the blockchain is an open marketplace for APIs and public goods and services. And developers can choose whatever API they want to build the product experiences that they care about. So SWE''s had a groundbreaking year. We launched an upgrade to a consensus algorithm that cut the consensus latency all the way down to 395 milliseconds. Rather than talking about it, I want to show you an example of what this really means in the real world. So let''s play the video. So this is a transaction as you''ll do in the Solana space on Jupiter. You want to do a swap between one asset and another. You''ll approve that on your wallet. And let''s see how long it takes in Solana. This is the best result we''re able to get trading on Sol. Now let''s compare that to SWE with the same swap, any kind of asset you want to swap. Less than a second. So in the real world, what matters is real world performance. SWE is ultimately 6 or 7x faster, 6 or 7x faster in Solana in terms of finality. And also infinitely faster in terms of actual throughput and scalability as well. What does that mean in terms of numbers? TVL on the chain. SWE is one of the fastest growing network by TVL. Number of users, DeFi protocols. It''s seeing a lot of mass adoption. Quite frankly, the reason why is it''s finding developer product markets that developers are loving. They''re building experience on SWE. They can build strictly differentiated products on SWE that they just can''t build anywhere else. And that''s why SWE has grown significantly beyond other chains. It''s been around for 18 months and I think it''s a number 14, 15 chain in the world. But I think in terms of layer 1s, it''s in the top 10 already. So the team has done a really amazing job this year. And it''s all to do with the innovation around making it an easy developer experience to build and also onboarding users with very simple semantics like ZK login, sponsored transactions, things that just make it feel like more of a Web 2 experience than anything else. Separately, we also believe gaming is going to be the biggest hook to bring users into Web 3. We actually think DeFi itself is not really a product. DeFi is a piece of infrastructure. Games all have the concept of ownership. They have the concept of transfers. And the idea of being able to own an asset, trade an asset, are all things that you do within a game. But now, you don''t have to rebuild that infrastructure as a game dev moving forward. DeFi is going to power the future of gaming. And to cover that even more, we are so bullish on gaming that we announced the launch of the 3Play 0x1. So before going about 3Play 0x1, can we play the video on games as well? So the thing about games in Web 3 we''ve seen mostly are normally just not fun games. It''s really kind of interesting, what we call spreadsheets that are made to look like games. But now we have top studios building on SWE. We''re going to be announcing some major partnerships this year. Studios who build some of the largest games in the world, games that cost $100 million to make, not just the traditional Web 3 games. Beyond that as well, we also have a games console called the 3Play 0x1. This games console effectively allows you to play Steam, Epic games directly from the App Store in addition to Web 3 games. Whether you''re playing a Web 2 or Web 3 game, you''re earning points, you''re earning rewards in a games console as powerful as your PC. The games console has some of the top specs. It''s actually more powerful than the Steam Deck. All your games on Steam Deck, you''ll be able to play directly on the 3Play 0x1. Your PC games as well, you''ll be able to play directly on deck. But more importantly, you can actually take your games with you. And you don''t have to select whether you want to play a Web 2 game or Web 3 game. You can simply have a device that plays all of them in a single device. The device also has an implementation where it''s inbuilt into a wallet with ZK login. So simply by logging into the device, you have a wallet, and you never have to really worry about downloads or anything of that nature. The device is almost sold out. It''s actually in the 3Play stores. You can order one today. I believe they''re NFTs for people who order the device, and they''re all earning some form of rewards over time as well. So to talk about what''s next, I actually want to welcome George. George is our chief scientist. He''s the brains behind a lot of the algorithms we build at Amiston Labs. And he wants to talk a bit more about the future of coordination on SWEET. Thank you. So the Internet has been around for a while, so we all had that experience, right? You visit a website, you read a nice story on the Internet, but then after a month, after six months, after a year, after five years, it disappears, right? Now, what is worse is that this experience now starts being replicated in the Web3 space. You buy an asset, you buy a digital asset, be it an NFT or some digital asset. In many cases, after a few years, the actual bytes, the actual image, the actual digital asset just disappears. And why does that happen? Because it is not actually stored on chain. Most of the Web3 digital assets are actually just a representation of the asset on chain, and the actual asset lives on a traditional cloud. Basically, the funding for that space runs out. It disappears. Even worse so, we actually are facing a situation where you''re trying to use a smart contract. You think that you''re interacting with something that has all the properties that we love about blockchain. It''s immutable. It''s going to be there tomorrow. It is censorship resistant, etc. But then you turn up, basically, after a month, thinking that you''re going to get back access to your assets, and you realize that the website that represented, let''s say, the user interface to that dApp is gone. Now, we can''t really realize the future that, Adini, you described, we are out to realize, namely reinventing the Internet to make it permissionless, to make it high assurance, and only actually having representations of assets on chain. What we need is to make sure that the actual data that dApps use, either for the media, or for the UX, or for the actual logic of the application on the web, also has the same properties as the contracts and the data on chain. Namely, you can trust that it will be there. You can trust that it is what basically was uploaded, and you can trust that, you know, you will be able to use it tomorrow. For this reason, the second protocol that Mistin Labs is initiating is called Walrus, and it is a security-centralized storage protocol. And with Walrus, basically what you can do is you can bring on chain and have the same properties for the blob data, namely the images, the media, the website that, you know, drives the dApp, as basically for the data that your smart contract is handling on chain. Now, Walrus is built on SWE, and I will talk a little bit about that because Walrus is the best example so far in my mind about what we mean when we say that SWE is a coordination layer. So let''s talk a little bit about how Walrus relates to SWE. We built SWE so that you can actually easily create decentralized dApps, right? And Walrus is just an example of such a dApp. So Walrus adds storage nodes to the universe of SWE. So there is basically a universe of storage nodes, but all of the coordination of the storage nodes, namely who they are, how they get paid, you know, how they change over time, what kind of media, what kind of files, what kind of, what is stored on them, all of that is coordinated through smart contracts on SWE. So what the result of that is that a lot of basically the storage on Walrus can be controlled through smart contracts and can actually be linked with all of the rest of the stuff that happens on SWE, including the DeFi, including all the other assets that are dealt on SWE. So now you can start having this kind of mixed experiences where on one side you have rich media. So for example, if you''re building a ticketing application, you can actually have a ticket that has images, that has, you know, original graphics, etc. All of that is stored on Walrus, but that interacts with the logic of the ticketing, the payments, who has access to it, transferability, etc. That basically is still done on SWE. So now we have extended the realm of DApps, not just into dealing with metadata just on the SWE chain, but actually with the actual data that lives on Walrus. Now, let me tell you a little bit about Walrus under the hood because to some extent there are other decentralized storage networks, but Walrus does a few things better than competitors that are available out there. First of all, Walrus does not actually store files as copies on many machines, but instead it uses what is known as erasure coding. In erasure coding, what you do is you take your file, you encode it into something that is four or five times bigger, and then you store chunks of that encoded file on every node in the network. What does that mean? First of all, what it means is that the overhead that you pay for storing a file is actually quite low. It''s only four to five times bigger what you store in the network than the file itself. But what you really get is a very high degree of resilience. Namely, any one-third of the storage nodes can actually disappear or stop responding, and you can still continue writing files into Walrus, or up to two-thirds can basically stop responding and disappear, and you can still read files in the network. And all of that you can do at the cost of just storing five times more data than you would store before. So this is very economic, it keeps the cost down, and it provides extreme resilience against failures to make sure that the files are there the next day. Now, the second thing that we really leverage with Walrus is that the economics of storage and the technology of storage has different economics than, let''s say, blockchains, right? In blockchains, the more validators you usually add to a blockchain, the capacity stays the same. In fact, the capacity may go down because there is more overhead in coordinating all of those validators with each other. Walrus, however, has very different dynamics because the more storage nodes you add to Walrus, the more disk capacity there is that you can use to store more data, and the more bandwidth there is to be able to write data and read data from Walrus. So, in fact, the economics are very elastic, as Denny mentioned, namely, the more we need to store and the more we need to do input-output into Walrus, the more machines we can add and automatically, basically, we increase the capacity of the system, which is pretty sweet. As I already mentioned, Walrus has a deep integration into SWE, and SWE allows you to control pretty much all aspects of Walrus. You can control, of course, the currency that is used to buy storage. Storage resources are these intelligent resources and intelligent assets that, I didn''t think you mentioned, you can split them, you can merge them, you can trade them. once you basically don''t need to store stuff anymore, you can sell it off to a secondary market. It really is something that belongs to you. Storage can just be bought and it''s yours, right? I mean, you can basically use it as if literally you bought a hard disk. So that''s quite a new paradigm out there. And, of course, you can control all aspects of the lifecycle of files that are stored on Walrus. You can control how their lifetime is extended, you can expand their space, you can delete them, and all of that can be done embedded in smart contracts that control the logic of all of that. So, for example, you can say, look, I''ll build an auditing app and it has a particular retention policy that is encoded in a smart contract and all of that is going to be taken care by the SWE security system and enforced on the Walrus site. Finally, with Walrus, we are trying to release some, you know, best-of-breed initial apps. The first one that will go out as soon as Walrus, well, that is already out on Testnet is what we call Walrus site. Walrus site basically tries to deliver the promise of the internet from back in the 90s and the 2000s. What you can do is you can just basically point to a folder that contains a website. It basically gets stored in Walrus and now you can start browsing it using its normal web browser. No need for wallet, no need for any special browser. It just appears on the internet as far as you''re concerned. And that now has high integrity, high availability, and auditability about the changes of the website. The second technology we''re going to roll out soon is called Seal. And with Seal, you can actually not just store public information on Walrus, but you can actually enforce access control. It uses an encryption technology that allows you to encrypt the file or parts of files that you upload in Walrus. And then it allows smart contracts to determine who has the right to access the keys to decrypt the file. Now that means that suddenly we can encode experiences relating to, for example, the content industry or the creator industry. You can upload an article, let''s say, where the first paragraph is in clear, the rest of the article is encrypted, and then upon a payment on the blockchain, on SWE, you can basically get the key, decrypt the rest of the article and display the whole thing. So it allows suddenly the realm of smart contracts to provide conditional access to data and enable all of the use cases that we''ve seen Web2 covering, but without the assurance that these technologies provide. Now, to some extent, the reason we''re building the whole SWE ecosystem and we''re augmenting the SWE ecosystem with Walrus is not just to serve the Web3 needs that we see today, right? We believe that some of the technologies we''re building and some of the properties that Walrus and SWE provide together can really be used to solve important things in the world, right? So, for example, charities have a need to demonstrate that the funding they get, the donations they get, really represent impact on the world. We didn''t really have a very good way of actually doing that in the Web3 space. With Walrus, what they can do is they can upload media, reports, videos, both themselves and others about the work they do. And then, because of the tight integration with Web3 and the SWE blockchain, you can basically have DAOs that determine funding that actually direct the funding to the different charities depending on basically what media they have shared and what kind of evidence you can see. So, suddenly, you can create these richer experiences that are all integrated in decentralized system using both Walrus and SWE. Similarly, we now have, within reach, experiences relating to more traditional social media, let''s say, right? You can have fans going to a sports event, recording the moment, sharing it socially with each other, with pictures, with videos, et cetera. And then, you can actually have brands that observe all of this activity on Walrus and SWE that reward fan engagement with VIP tickets or collectibles or tokens or whatever in order to actually have a direct relationship with their fan base. again, you use both Walrus for the media and the kind of, you know, bulk data and SWE in order to actually control the collectibles and the passes, et cetera. Finally, something that is very close to my heart is decentralized science. Science should be something that has high integrity, that everybody can trust and that is open to everybody and yet, today, let''s face it, it is really behind closed doors or it is controlled by a cartel, effectively, of publishers that doesn''t really let results flow as freely as possible. Now, again, one could think of a world where we combine Walrus and SWE in order to improve that. You can have scientists registering their experimental protocols, the results of their experiments, even their papers on Walrus because this is all big data, we can''t just record it on a blockchain. and then the blockchain being used, again, as part of the review process that can be open and as part of actually directing funding to different projects that seem more promising than others in order to actually improve the scientific literature out there and the results humanity relies on. Now, all of this is aspirational and I hope that folks can go out there and be, you know, try to build some of that but in practice we already have a very healthy ecosystem of partners that are working with us to build specific things. So, for example, Ethereum is building an app that is streaming music and the music is, of course, stored on Walrus and all of the payments and the rights controls and the access controls are done on SWE. So, again, we have SWE effectively acting as a coordination layer both for the data that is on Walrus but also for the logic by which who can access what data. We''re also working with OneChampionship and they''re using Walrus, again, to store media relating to their martial arts brands and SWE, again, for doing fan engagement in relation to basically that media. Talus is also a very interesting partner of ours. They basically build AI agents that interact with the blockchain and, again, they use Walrus both to store their models, store their inferences, store their data sets and, of course, they interact with SWE in order to optimize particular things that the agent is asked to optimize. Tusky is a partner of ours that takes the basic technology around Walrus and Seal and builds an equivalent, let''s say, cloud folder for people to store their data and be able to actually share their data. You can put up your files, you can share them with friends, you can share them with family or you can publish them using both SWE and Seal and Walrus. Decrypt is the well-known crypto media site and they basically use Walrus as part of their story to make sure that if basically their main website goes down, the media, basically, they have created remains available and you can still read it and, you know, they cannot be suffering from other failures or censorship in their infrastructure. And finally, Arkham is a partner that works in the space of security of blockchains and analytics of blockchains. They look at blockchains, they do monitoring, etc. And they are going to be publishing on Walrus datasets about basically the trustworthiness of addresses, the trustworthiness of transactions, etc. This is big data. You could not just store it on chain before. Now it''s going to be available on the decentralized store that is built by Walrus. So, by all means, Walrus is today at kind of like a testnet phase. We have already a network with over 100 nodes. We are doing tests around how it scales and its performance. You are already able to bring up Walrus sites, store resources, read resources, write smart contracts on the sweet testnet that exercise all the functions that I''m actually mentioning here. We''re observing some very impressive results where you can upload at the rate of hundreds of megabytes and download at the rate of hundreds of megabytes data. And we have about a petabyte of storage already on testnet. But the interesting news is that very soon we''re actually going to be going into mainnet. And we hope that this is going to be happening in March. So join us and use it and build on it. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('48ed56202e', 'Welcome Remarks', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Music Good morning. This is really awesome to finally see. We are all gathered from truly around the world at ConsenSys Hong Kong. This is the Open Money Summit and this is the stage where you''re going to learn all things about how traditional finance and the digital ecosystem are converging and intersecting. I''m Tira Gray, Managing Director of Coindesk Events, and it''s truly a pleasure to welcome you in our very first session, which could not be more appropriate to start the day with, from Wall Street to crypto. We have three esteemed Wall Street veterans joining us today for this opening session. It is my pleasure to welcome them to the stage. The at scale is best represented by the over 8,000 attendees of which over 75% traveled from outside of Hong Kong to join us. We have nearly 100 countries represented here today. Second is to leverage Hong Kong''s unique geographic position to be a gateway to Asia. We have gathered the top voices and ecosystems from around the region to provide attendees an effective and efficient way to gain substantive insight into the Asia region. And finally, third is to showcase Hong Kong. This is my home and it is our ambition to lead the Web3 industry in how conferences can incorporate the uniqueness of our host city. It''s been our desire with ConsenSys to incorporate iconically Hong Kong elements into the official conference experience and to get you to fall in love with our city. One of the best examples of this is the partnership that we have as the first ever Web3 Cup race sponsor for the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which we will be hosting the ConsenSys Cup tonight at the Happy Valley Racecourse, an iconically Hong Kong experience you should not miss. On top of that, there are over 330 side events scattered across the city this week. I hope that you get the chance to experience everything the city of Hong Kong has to offer. We sincerely appreciate how much time, effort and resources you have invested into making ConsenSys Hong Kong one of the most important Web3 conferences globally this year. We also appreciate how much time, a lot of the people who have done this work, we are here today. Thank you. Those are some incredible stats, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Joe Son. Zao Sang-hao. Wow, I am just beyond energized by the enthusiasm and the excitement that''s in this room right now. Thank you so much to everyone who traveled from near and far here to Hong Kong to join us this week. On behalf of CoinDesk, we are thrilled to be building on the legacy of the Consensus Conference, the longest running and the most respected digital asset conference in the world by expanding and growing and bringing the experience here to Asia. This marks the first major crypto gathering this year, really setting the stage for 2025. Even though we''re just a few weeks into this year, it''s already been a landmark start to 2025 with so much happening in the space. What an exciting time to be in the digital assets industry and to all be gathered here together. We''re seeing real progress from around the world as governments like right here in Hong Kong develop clear crypto regulations. And as a result, after what feels like many years of waiting, more institutions are entering the space. And institutional adoption is really starting to gain some momentum. We''re discovering new practical use cases for blockchain technology more and more every single day. And finally, the entire space is buzzing with new entrants who are just driving this innovation and growth. So as you walk the halls of the convention center over these next few days, as you listen in on panels, as you partake in meetings, I hope you''ll have the opportunity to really explore and discuss all of these exciting developments that are happening. I hope you meet with some great people. I hope you learn a ton. And I also hope you close some deals, which is what consensus is really, really all about. So again, I want to thank you all for being here. We hope you have an incredible and productive time here at this conference. And we look forward to seeing you in just a few months at our flagship conference, consensus conference, which is happening this year in Toronto in May. So thank you so much. And without further ado, I''ll let Michael introduce our honorary keynote speaker today. Thank you. Thank you so much, Sarah. So with that, I would now like to invite the Honorable Mr. Paul Chen, Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR, to join us on stage to deliver his opening keynote.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.128', NULL, 'https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-welcome-remarks-93', '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');
INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('9df440f241', 'Web3 Blueprint for Hong Kong Report', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' . Extremely humbled for this opportunity to launch the Web3 Hong Kong Blueprints. Firstly, I want to introduce Web3 Harbor. Now, Web3 Harbor is the region''s premier pro-innovation, pro-collaboration Web3 Industry Association. You may know us over the last, I don''t know, year and a half across Hong Kong for various different reasons, but I want to focus on a few notable areas that I''m extremely proud for the association to be part of. First and foremost, last year, we ran a month-long celebration at Hong Kong Fintech Week called Blocktober, and it was an astounding success. We also have done multiple smart contact series every third Thursday of every month. We have an industry leader, industry executive, coming to talk to us about all the on-goings and updates from across the world. And lastly, to the core of why Web3 Harbor is so special, we have two subcommittees. One subcommittee focused on enterprise development, basically Hong Kong-listed companies and Hong Kong-originated companies wanting to build Web3 use cases with the rest of the ecosystem. And the other one is our regulatory and VATP subcommittee, focused on improving the experience of licensees through the process and for incumbents to maximize their license. So, why are we here today? You know, one thing about Web3 Harbor that''s so special is the community that we represent. We have over 25, 27 companies actually, I''ve just updated, 27 companies that focus on why Web3 should be the key focus of Hong Kong. And that leads us to our key learnings. Our key learnings around how to build the future of finance with Web3 in mind for Hong Kong. What is the blueprint? The blueprint, simply put, is the private sector''s commitment to Hong Kong government priorities. And the first of these many priorities announced and launched last year at the Hong Kong FinTech Week is how does Hong Kong become an international financial hub with Web3 in mind. So, as we get through that, I do want to talk about how we came up with this process. It does not happen in an echo chamber. It''s really important to have consultation, collaboration, and sticking to our pro-collaboration, pro-innovation commitment, the idea was to first connect with the Hong Kong government to understand where the gaps were in terms of moving this to the next generation financial hub. Through that process, we assembled a really rock star team, and they''re sitting here up in the front, of industry experts from our membership. And through this approach, we were able to come up with a first draft of the report, of the blueprint. And so you see here today, we''re in the middle of this process. So, after immediately this discussion, we will open it up for public consultation. And in this, we really need the help from the community to read, to understand, as well as to give feedback to this entire process. And once that happens, we will be able to commit to the government and to the rest of the Web3 ecosystem, what''s next before we move into the next version of the commitments from the various priorities. Okay. So, this concept, which, you know, I was speaking to our chairman, Gary Liu, about this. And he had made a very, very astute conversation about having different types of regulation and jurisdictions that regulate differently around the world. So, some accept and allow crypto. But what''s unique about Hong Kong is the active purpose of integrating crypto with the current financial system in the markets. So, this is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity that should not be taken lightly. Now, in terms of why Hong Kong has the right to win and the right to play in this space, just fundamentally at its core, from Hong Kong''s pre-existence of really driving innovation with a lot of the crypto infrastructure that we take for granted, many people obviously know, but some may not. A lot of the infrastructure that we take for granted today has come and originated from Hong Kong. Now, moving forward, because we have this pedigree and specifically just from the traditional financial sense, eight trillion dollars assets under management, over 15,000 organizations and institutions operate here in Hong Kong, and then we are a multi-lateral trade focused hub from cross-border activities. We deserve and we have the right to win in the virtual asset space, to create new products, lead in standards, adoption and regulation, as well as be the super connector from east and west. How do we actually start getting there? And so the Web3 Blueprint is this approach, this framework, and it''s right here. There''s multiple different sections. We will focus and deep dive into areas between Web3 talent and how we actually take practical steps from the private sector, alongside the priorities with the Hong Kong government, to make this a reality. First and foremost, focusing on the current existing extant structure, which is Cyberport and Science Park. And then really thinking about what other private sector commitments can we actually look at to make sure that this is actually robust and competitive. Next thing is what I call market-tecture. You know, it''s very funny. We were going through this entire process of talking about, okay, what blockchain infrastructure, what systems, what solutions, and we always kept going to this market infrastructure, market architecture. Market-tecture is really what we need. It''s this really close, no daylight synergy between what the market and the business needs and what we can actually do with infrastructure and Web3 technology. And so some of the things I really, really want to focus on with the architecture is really on the artificial intelligence integration with Web3. Another thing is around the adoption of standards for the movement and transfer of information so that we can have these robust systems in place. Standards. Standards, extremely, extremely important. One of the key areas of standards is really being able to accept global international standards as well as set them. Setting standards is not only important for our presence as the international financial hub, but also for the ability for us to explore and innovate. And this leads to other regulation activities and sandbox activities. Technology contribution commitment from market diversification. One of the areas I think is truly special in this blueprint, as you''ll see, is a call to action. The call to action from private sector to participate in private sector-led sandboxes to ideate and test different use cases. Now use cases often misconstrued with we need to find a reason to build on Web3. In fact, if you have to find a reason to build on Web3, that''s already late to the game. So one thing is creating new opportunities from scratch that not necessarily requires pre-existing infrastructure and processes to be renewed, but looking at new products and services that have been created with people like in this regulatory subcommittee as well as the enterprise subcommittee. Regulation. Regulation has been a hot and important topic for Hong Kong and our existence as an association for quite some time. But I think moving forward, one of the very interesting areas is supervisory technology. So understanding how Hong Kong can be not only a trend center in terms of standards, but also focusing on what it means to be an international financial hub when we''re looking at regulatory, regtech, and supervisory tech. Okay, so with all of these different opportunities in play, how can you contribute? What is the value add and what is the call to action that we have for the audience today? Okay. Very simple. Scan. Read. And we will have a form. And this form, again, is open until the end of this quarter. After, we''ll publish a final version of this paper in which we''ll move over to elements of the FSDC policy so we can start moving towards a policy position. And then we will restart this process for the next commitment. Over the next two to three quarters leading into the next policy address. I''m super excited about this because this allows us to create a backbone. A backbone of discourse with private and public sector. And then a focus to separate both from a marketing perspective, as well as from a policy and regulatory contribution. I really, really want to thank everybody today for taking the time to come and be part of this. Again, the call to action. Please get on. Please share with your friends. And people who are not from Hong Kong, please enjoy the city. And as Honorable Paul Chan said, make it the most while you''re here today. But before I close out, there''s actually something special. You know, this blueprint wasn''t built by people who were paid to do this. It was, again, a task force assembled of industry experts and subject matters. Sorry. Industry leaders and subject matter experts in their respective fields with priorities focused on the policy address. So it''s very important to understand and thank those individuals for all the contributions they made throughout the entire process. And I wanted to take the opportunity today to also talk about our first commitment that we can immediately address. So one of our members, IDA, you may know them from the Sablecoin activities that they are engaged in. They have created the Web3 Future Leaders Program with various different universities here in Hong Kong. And I''m excited to talk about how they''ve actually connected that with our first commitment. And through this, I hope that there will be more and more commitments from the rest of the private sector and the rest of our membership. So with that said, I wanted to thank the team and have a wonderful consensus. And then also please, again, take a look at this blueprint, contribute, and give us your feedback. Because it''s so important to have the public information back to us. Thanks, doctor. Thank you. Speaker 1 We''re housed in town. And there''s one.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('9e649fe3c5', 'Why Polkadot is the Best Place to Build Web3', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' So, we have here Nicholas, co-founder from Velocity Labs. We have Flavio, CMO from Polymac. We have Matt Cook, co-founder and Cede, BDO from Mandala Foundation. And Shiga, founder and managing director from Trace Labs and Origin Trail. Hey, welcome. Hey. So, Nico, let''s start with you. You are the co-founder of Velocity Labs. Just give us a quick intro of what you do, but then also more importantly, what''s currently going on in Polkadot Cloud, Polkadot Hub, what do these things mean? Absolutely. Well, first of all, good morning, everyone. Thanks. Thank you for having us here. So, Velocity Labs is a core contributor to Polkadot ecosystem, and we focus on two main areas. One is we do BD for DeFi and infrastructure, so that means that we make sure that the Polkadot ecosystem, with all of its parachains and builders, have all the necessary pieces to actually build great products. So, that includes custodians, centralized exchanges, stable coins, bridges, or close, etc., etc. And then the second arm that we have is a product and engineering arm, where we have a very unique view into how the core protocol development is going, and also how builders are using it, and we kind of find and identify pain points to solve by building tooling and products with our team. So, that''s a little bit of what Velocity does. More specifically around the Polkadot ecosystem and this new framework that we''re using, which is Hub and Cloud. I''m a big fan of analogies, which allow us to kind of abstract these more complex subjects. And the way that I would put it is that Polkadot, since inception, which was four, four and a half years ago, we sort of built race cars when developers were just starting to drive, which basically meant we were too early to the market of actually building and developing chains. Back in 2020, 2021, people were just starting to iterate with smart contracts on generalized chains. We''re starting to build the DeFi primitives or like gamified primitives that we know nowadays. And then after a couple of years, fast forward to today, then the demand for chains and the demand for customization and scalability started to arrive. So, we''re a bit too early. Let''s say this chain concept that we offer as a protocol is what we call Hub. Sorry, what we call Cloud, which is any developer wanting to spin out its own parachain. Now, the other focus that we''re having is kind of focusing in the earlier stage of the builder cycle, which is this concept of Hub. And Hub, we''re leaning a lot into the EVM world. We actually want to lower the barriers of entry to developers, provide those familiar tools of developers in the EVM and in the Ethereum ecosystem, but actually allow them to combine those with Polkadot native functionalities like its throughput, its interoperability, and its scalability. So, yeah, I''ll stop there. That''s a little bit of kind of where we are as an ecosystem. All right. Okay. Thank you, Niklas. Flavio, let''s continue with you. So, you are part of the team from Polymech, and you are an ICO protocol. So, give us a little bit of an introduction, and then I''ll follow up with my question. Yeah, more than happy to do an introduction. So, Flavio from Polymech, as mentioned, we basically bring back ICOs, but this time we settle them on chain. So, we''re a decentralized funding protocol that settles those fundraisers on chain. We have a lot of investors, a lot of projects that are coming to us because they don''t really like the current stage of how basically the baseline is for raising funds. Over the last couple of years, it''s been very dominated by VCs. There was a very opaque scene in primary markets and not a lot of access as well for investors. So, we want to make it more transparent, more accessible, and also more secure by having it on chain. So, without having those reliabilities of centralized parties, no counterparty risk, no financial outsourcing. Since we put everything on chain, it also allows us to act as software, which also in turn then means we are able to integrate with financial intermediaries directly, which is one of the scalability strategies that we are running. So, think of exchanges for the Polkadot OGs. If you remember back in the days, you were able to participate in those part chain auctions or leases on, for example, Crockin or other exchanges. And we are now looking to implement similar products for fundraising just to make capital allocation much more efficient, more accessible, and for you to have some good deals on your table. So, the Polkadot hub is basically the go-to portal for new users and developers, but it''s also the portal that bridges to systems like Ethereum and other chains. So, it gives you access to use the T, use the seed natively on Polkadot, but also this interoperability aspect. Can you go a little bit into how PolyMech is leveraging it? Yeah, more than happy. One of the big reasons why we initially wanted to become a part chain or a roll up, whatever you want to call it, and build on Polkadot was that we have the ability to actually bridge to other chains. Which is also why, I think, I don''t know if this is an exclusive, but we are soon announcing our expansion to Ethereum as well, with other L2s following up. What does that mean? It means we are able to actually have fundraisers from EVM based projects on PolyMech, which is built on Polkadot. You know, Polkadot sometimes is called the relay chain because it relays the messages between all the chains. And I think this is sort of what we look at as a power tool for us to be able to, you know, offer our services beyond any ecosystem and really bridge into every different community and offer those deals. And obviously bridging assets is very important. I think also Nico is playing a big role with Velocity Labs there and supporting us in how can we bridge assets to invest in those protocols, but also then the migration process once those tokens go live. Yeah. So pretty cool. Yeah, I think it really highlights the interoperability aspect of Polkadot where you can connect to different ecosystems and orchestrate all the activity from Polkadot. Absolutely. All right. Okay. Thank you, Flavio. Matt, you are part of Mandala chain, your founder, co-founder, co-founder, co-founder, sorry, co-founder and chief business development officer. Yeah. Right. So for me, this is very interesting because you''re building guv tech or governance tech. That''s at least how I frame it. I''m going to be interested to hear how you frame it. But the interesting part of Polkadot for me is that it''s very heavy on web free, right? It''s not just about DeFi and financialization, but it''s also about bringing a benefit to the real world. And for me, Mandala is a project that really highlights this in terms of developing products that are going to affect millions of people. So maybe can you share a little bit about Mandala and what you''re currently doing? Yeah, sure. It''s great to be here. Thank you. So Mandala chain is based in Indonesia right now, our core team, but we''re very much not focused only on Indonesia. We are starting our initial use cases there because we have a strong advantage with our connections with government and enterprise. What we essentially are is we''re a parachain in the Mandala ecosystem, a layer one capability parachain. So that brings together three different sectors, the government, the enterprise, and then obviously the public permission world. And so we felt that Polkadot, after kind of weighing our options in the beginning, really provided the most modularity and adaptability for being able to cater towards the enterprise or the government needs. A lot of times we have private permission requirements that then need to interact seamlessly with the public retail or decentralized permission world. So Polkadot really allows us to be that solution. So yeah, just a couple other things is that we''re focusing a lot on in the early stages on digital identity because Indonesia has a massive population. And with some of the other use cases that we''re building for microfinance and medical, this allows us to have an identity solution that is able to interact with government and enterprise portals. So yeah, we can talk more about that later. All right. Thank you, Matt. Okay. Shiga. OriginTrail. We founded OriginTrail. And it''s a platform for knowledge assets. Yeah. So I''m very happy about this because it was part of my computer science curriculum. But maybe can you explain a little bit and how it is helping people? Yeah. Yeah. The story or the origins of the OriginTrail date back to 2012 actually when we built the first rudimentary solution to basically improve transparency in supply chains. And that''s over 13 years now. And we''ve done a lot of like different iterations on OriginTrail technology from being a centralized solution to becoming a decentralized solution that was then later employed by much, much larger companies than initially. One of the first companies that initially employed OriginTrail to improve transparency supply chains was a dairy in central Europe. And it already featured. It was already featured the application that was based on OriginTrail back in 2014. So there are still like, you know, TV commercials from back then. And then in 2016, we started experimenting with Ethereum. And we also saw that Ethereum was not, you know, appropriate solution as a blockchain to really drive enterprise adoption. And later on, we have experimented with a lot of additional L2s like Nossys, Matic and so on. But we really found out that none of those solutions can compare, you know, with the parachain infrastructure on top of Polkadot. So what OriginTrail is, is basically a merger between two technologies, blockchain, which you all know here, and knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs were popularized by Google to power browsing experience. So you can consider OriginTrail technologically as sort of a Google for Web3, although it might sound a little bit, you know, cocky to say this is a Google for Web3. But it essentially works as a Google technology does. And why is that important? OriginTrail right now powers some 20% of overall imports to the United States by supporting audit exchange, audit reports exchanges between major retailers such as Walmart, Home Depot, Costco, Now these audit reports describe what''s going on, what went on within some 30,000 factories that import to the United States. So we kind of see that technology is still better, you know, more suited to be put in place than tariffs right now in the States if you want to improve the frictionless international trade. Then we''re also securing transportation in Switzerland with SBB, Swiss Federal Railways. So those for Switzerland are traveling with train, you''re also, you know, in a way safer thanks to what SBB does with OriginTrail and dozens of other European funded projects. And lately we''ve been also onboarding a partner that handles some 150 million daily users on their internet platform. And all of these things like the real world challenges that we''re tackling require scalability. And today, I believe still by the end of the last year, OriginTrail assumed over 50% of all transactions within the Polkadot ecosystem. So we''re really banging that hard. And, yeah, what''s becoming even more important in the present day is the online content. And we see that AI is now becoming the number one generator of either fake news or, you know, things that are not, you know, according to reality. And this is kind of the next stage where OriginTrail with the help of Polkadot technology will have to even, you know, amp up its activities in order to tackle the new challenges that we''re facing as a humanity. Okay. Wow. I didn''t know the first part that your company has been existing for 13 years. Yeah. So I think it''s a really, it''s a really nice highlight story of how Web3 is popping up as an option to do all of those things in the blockchain space. And you''re doing this transition. It''s really interesting. And I think it''s also nice to highlight that it works for Polkadot cloud as, as, as this space where you can deploy applications like Web3 applications. And you get the throughput that you need. So one thing that is sometimes new for people is that Polkadot is not like Ethereum or Solano or other chains in that it is a single virtual machine, but it''s basically a multicore system. Like on your phone right now, you have multiple processor cores running. Right. And so Polkadot offers a similar thing. So any chain that needs additional resources can tap into those multiple cores. Right. And I was hearing that the you''re already looking forward to this upcoming release when you can tap into multiple cores. Yeah, it''s, it''s definitely just a matter of time when much, much greater scalability is going to be necessary. I mean, it''s, it started small 10, 12 years ago, but now, you know, things are, you know, we are in the big boys league and we need to make sure that we''re using the technology that can support not just Web3 applications, but the mainstream adoption. And mainstream adoption requires, you know, much, much higher levels of scalability and also shared security. And all of these things are, you know, being made possible possible only by Polkadot, according to our experience. All right. Okay. Thank you, Shiga. Nicholas. So I want to dive a little bit deeper into hub, Polkadot hub and what''s upcoming, especially in terms of DeFi, since this is your specialization. And I know that you''re working with a lot of companies to, to get them ready. So can you give us a little bit of a tease? Yep, absolutely. Um, so the hub is basically a component, um, or a project built out of two main components. Uh, one of the main components is we''re actually moving all the functionalities from the relay chain, which is the dot token, uh, governance and staking activities up into this rollup called the hub. And then the second component of this upgrade is turning it into EVM compatible. So it''s going to be the first time in Polkadot''s history that we''re going to be able to develop products that actually tap into these very core functionalities of the Polkadot ecosystem, like governance and staking. So that''s one, uh, obviously giving that we''re making this EVM compatible and allowing smart contracts to be deployed. Um, it''s also very exciting because it''s basically a white canvas where we''re talking to builders and trying to get them to actually come and build, uh, on Polkadot. As I mentioned before, with their familiar EVM, uh, tooling environments, but also being able to leverage these very unique Polkadot functionalities. So we are building from the very typical deep-by primitives like DEXs, UNIB3 type of DEXs, money markets, et cetera, et cetera. But what really gets us exciting is what can be built on Polkadot that can be built elsewhere. And I think that''s kind of probably drive a lot of the activity in, in, in Polkadot going forward. Um, so yeah, it''s something that we''re, we''re really excited for. All right. Okay. Thank you, Nicholas. Flavio. Um, so PolyMik is an ICO protocol, but I think in some way that even undersells it because there is, there is, uh, it, it has such a capacity to do more things because it is its own dedicated chain. So, um, maybe you can share a little bit more about that. Uh, and maybe in relation to, uh, you already did a few of those, uh, ICOs for protocols, maybe some good story to tell here. Yeah. I mean, um, what we usually sell ourselves as what we call a settlement layer, but that sounds a bit boring. So we say ICO protocol. Um, but at the end of the day, we settle deals in the primary market. Uh, so primary markets are not really accessible. There''s no second, no market for it per se. There''s no liquidity for it. Um, so what we provide is we settle those deals on chain, which obviously from day on, uh, day one makes us very scalable on the global stage, uh, very accessible. It makes it very transparent in the sense that, you know, you have the same terms and conditions, um, compared to everyone else investing in those opportunities alongside you. Uh, we have like a slogan and we call it, uh, I am the VC now because we sort of allow everyone to become their own VC and tap into the same opportunities and deal flow. Um, but this goes into this layer of being able to have this, uh, settlement, settlements on, on chain. Uh, on top of that, we also use KYC solutions, which means we sort of create a compliant investing environment, which makes it very important for not only investors, but also for teams to be able to then, you know, later on bring their funds to, because you still need them, banks, uh, or other financial intermediaries that you require for your services. Um, so we sort of create much more of an ecosystem in that sense. Um, it''s a very fragmented market. As you know, the deal flow is fragmented, the liquidity is fragmented, and we want to aggregate it all in one ecosystem to provide us opportunities. Um, as you mentioned, we, we did have a couple of really cool fundraisers last year. Uh, this year we will have the second wave starting in March. Um, so as you mentioned with the hub going live as well, we also expect much more Ethereum focused projects or EVM compatible projects to build on Polkadot. Uh, to have those smart contracts come over, it''s much easier to build. Uh, you don''t need the entire rollup anymore. So for us, uh, the part is just getting started. Yeah. All right. Okay. Thank you. Uh, round us, round us off a little bit and maybe as a little bit of a tease when once identity becomes possible on Mandala, what are some other applications that you can build on top that have some impact in the real world for, for people? Sure. Well, the, the identity is a key element to onboard more users. So the, the public can actually, the non web three natives can actually participate in, in blockchain without even really knowing it. So whether they''re interacting with their hospitals or their, their bank, um, this is all possible through the KYC and the verified credentials. If we have the UI UX the way it needs to be. Um, but yeah, for Mandala, we''re also working on a lot of other use cases as far as supply chain. Um, also some RWA, uh, tokenization, which is very exciting. We''re going to be launching a marketplace for RWA is very soon. Um, but also our, our kind of Mandala chain Academy has just launched where we''re training up a lot of Indonesian students, uh, university students to, to become, um, let''s say blockchain savvy and understand, uh, various codes like rust and solidity. And so that''s very exciting to be able to onboard, uh, new developers. Um, but also I''d say that the identity solution is now, um, being integrated with some AI infra that will help with fraud protection. And that also will trickle down into some of the finance as well. Um, there''s a lot you could do with the AI agents, um, we''re finding. Um, we''re finding so, um, I''ll also end with, uh, we have a new nation state that we''re onboarding. We can''t make the announcement just yet, but, uh, it''s looking pretty official. So we''re very happy with the copied paste deploy, uh, that we''re building out the infrastructure, the use cases, and then we can just bring that to different countries. Yeah. A new nation state. Okay. Super exciting. Thank you. Yeah. I think we could give you a little bit of an insight into what polka dot cloud and polka dot hub is capable to do. It''s for web free. It''s the place to build web free, uh, where you can build applications that are gonna change the world. So hopefully we can see more of you, uh, coming to polka dot soon and feel free to reach out, uh, to us with any questions. Every good consensus.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('9eddb93450', 'Fireside with Web3 Foundation''s CFO', '待定', ' Fireside Chats', ' My name is Max Ruebal on behalf of Polkadot. A very warm welcome here in Hong Kong. I''m based in Hong Kong, by the way, so I''m very excited to see so many faces join us here from overseas. And I''m particularly excited to welcome Thomas, the COO and CFO of the Web3 Foundation, which is the foundation behind Polkadot. So we''re going to have like a 20-minute fireside chat here, the two of us, and then afterwards move on to a panel discussion with builders on Polkadot. Now before I get into it, who am I and why am I moderating this conversation here? So I''m kind of having two different roles within the Polkadot ecosystem. One is what you can see here, Polkaport East, which is a growth and IR initiative for Polkadot in Hong Kong. And the second thing is Harbor Industrial Capital, which is a Polkadot-focused VC fund, also based out of Hong Kong and focused on investing in early-stage startups within the Polkadot ecosystem. So with that, let''s get started with our conversation with Thomas. Thomas, very, very nice having you here. Flew in from Switzerland to Hong Kong. Thomas, start a little bit with your background. You''ve been in the Polkadot space for quite a long time. Maybe can you walk us a little bit through your journey in Polkadot? When did you first meet Gavin, for example, and how did you decide to become involved at the foundation for Polkadot? Yeah. Thanks, Max. Thanks for having me. Pleasure to be here. I kind of came into the Polkadot ecosystem through my business angel and venture capital activity. Started doing that in 06 and then went into the rabbit hole of Bitcoin. And in Switzerland, as you are well aware of, there was this development of the crypto valley around Zug, greater area, Zug and Zurich. And hence a lot of protocols and projects were arriving and kind of developing and launching. And I followed these protocols. And then in 19, I had my first touch point with Polkadot. So quite early. Yeah. I was participating in the funding, the private sales. And three years ago, when Three Foundation got in touch with me again because he had to fill a position as CFO. And we engaged. After having certain discussions, I kind of took that opportunity. And a couple of months later, my mandate got broadened a bit. Today I''m responsible for the operations and finance of the Web3 Foundation. Okay. Then let''s dive directly into this topic. What is it really that the Web3 Foundation does for Polkadot? And maybe also how did the role of the foundation change over time? Yeah. I think the mission of the foundation didn''t change a lot since the establishment back in 2017 it was. So it has always been enforcing and supporting the development of the decentralized Web. And we do that through supporting Polkadot, through the development of Polkadot, which is our native protocol. We have a canary protocol, test protocol, Kusama. But the main focus is on Polkadot. And for me it''s really important that the people here recognize that Web3 Foundation is not the managing entity or the manager behind the protocol, but rather a shepherd, a coordinator. And all decisions actually related to the future of the protocol are taken by the dot holders through open governance. That''s a good keyword. So there''s gov on the one hand side and then there''s the foundation on the other hand side. For the foundation, what are some of the key programs that you''re running to support the growth? So I first probably go into the growth drivers and then the programs. So if we talk about growth drivers, what the foundation really does, the clusters within the foundation, we have three of them. So the first is a cutting edge research team. A lot of people don''t know that, but we have quite a big team actually focusing on research in cryptography, in game theory and in economics. And these findings flow them back into the engineering work that is being done by Parity, who is our core engineering entity. And then we have education and governance coordination, which shouldn''t be underestimated as well because education is kind of the layer of the adoption, right? If you do not educate people, if you do not communicate what Polkadot is capable to do, you know, the adoption will not follow, right? So these two pillars are actually not as known as the other one. And the biggest, the last, is actually the funding program. So we have a dedicated grants program, which has three sub-clusters. The first one is the regular grants program, which is publicly known, very transparent, and we supported over 600 teams and projects so far in the past. And if we talk about amounts given away, you know, we talk about millions, right? It''s really material. And it''s all about supporting open software development. Then we have a second layer, a second cluster, where this is called Founders Grants Program, where we really want to catch the talents very early, at the early stage, and support them. And the third one is a strategic grants program. Everything else that doesn''t fit in the other two boxes goes into that program. And there we talk also about bigger tickets. Got it. Yeah. When talking about this funding, you often mention the flywheel effect that the foundation is trying to achieve. Yeah. Can you elaborate on that? Yeah. Let me first dive into other programs we have, actually. So we have this funding program. But recently, we also launched decentralized nodes. Ah, yeah. Okay. Under the umbrella of decentralization, which we are a firm believer in, you know, decentralization and resilience is basically the core kind of non-negotiable point for Polkadot. We launch decentralized nodes where we have an application process. You know, potential validators can actually apply. Mm-hmm. Go through that application process. And once they pass that, we basically nominate them to be in the active set. Then we have a second program that was launched a couple of months ago, decentralized voices. Again, under this resilience decentralization umbrella, where we try to achieve also diversification on the open go off side. Right? So we have quite an active open governance framework and active community. And we strive for that. This is kind of something we want to see. However, you know, the foundation has quite a lot of dot holdings. And we actually abstain from voting whenever we can. So by doing that, we established actually wanted to activate these voting, that voting power, and established decentralized voices where, you know, DAOs teams within the ecosystem can apply again. If they pass, we actually nominate or delegate the voting power to them so that they can actively, actively contribute to the open governance. Got it. And then there''s a third one, decentralized futures. Yeah. Decentralized futures was one of the biggest, actually. So that was launched back end of 23 when we had a resetting within parity and Web3 foundation. We wanted to focus again on kind of what we are doing. And this is engineering, right? And for the first time with that program, we supported actually non-engineering work heavily. So we went into marketing, business development, growth opportunities, event management, open golf coordination. And this was a huge program. It was five million dots and $20 million all in back then with the prices we have seen end of 23. We were talking about 55, $60 million equivalent. Wow. Yeah. But this has basically stopped end of 24 and is now a part of the strategic grants program. Okay. And then going back to this flywheel that you were talking about? Yeah, right. The flywheel. So when I arrived at the Web3 foundation, there was this constant claim that, you know, there was a funding gap within the ecosystem. And I wanted to tackle that. So I''m quite the structured guy. I want to approach solutions in a structured way. So I came up with that conceptually with that flywheel where we have five components. And when we tackle these components and give them a push into the right direction, the whole flywheel should actually activate the self-funding mechanism within the ecosystem. Okay. And let me deep dive quickly into these components. You know, first of all, it starts with the value proposition of Polkadot with the technology step, which we are a firm believer in, of course. And then it goes into early stage capital. And if I talk about early stage capital, I don''t mean VC funding. I rather mean projects that need funding before they are ready for VC funding. So we talk about the grants program. Then it''s liquidity provisioning. We do liquidity provisioning through different vehicles indirectly into the ecosystem. And this is also something we need to strengthen, basically. We need to push more. This means also that we support actually infrastructure that enables liquidity provisioning, not only directly injecting liquidity into the ecosystem. The third component is multiple capital sources. And that''s quite an interesting one where we had actually focused on the last couple of months. We committed capital to various VCs out there. We were focusing on ecosystem VCs and now we are focusing actually on external VCs and invite them to participate in the ecosystem. This was quite a big push, actually. We had a long list of 25 names. We did some due diligence, of course, and ended up with a short list of roughly eight. And by the end of 25, we will have committed a substantial amount to them. And hopefully onboard it with six to eight of the VCs. This is one layer in that bucket, multiple capital sources. But then there''s another one where we focus actually to get more capital, more fresh dry powder in from the trade fi guys. And how we do that is we actually invite them to structure investment products. SPVs, OTC vehicles, but also exchange trader products where they actually gather money. And then, you know, with the hope that they activate actually the capital contribution into an injection into the ecosystem. And this is going quite well. So I can communicate that we had quite some success the last couple of weeks. And, you know, there will be more in the pipeline. The second last component is marketing and communications. This is something that we need to do better. You know, we need to tell people the storyline of Polkadot about the capabilities so that we attract developers, more developers in the ecosystem where they can actually build stuff. And then, of course, attract also end users of these products and applications. And, you know, last but not least, if all these components are actually pushed into the right direction and the positive momentum is created, hopefully investors who invested into Polkadot will get a decent return relative to the risk taken, of course, and reinvest into the ecosystem. So all in, you know, we are a firm believer that, you know, with that framework, if you push all these components in parallel, actually the self-funding process of the ecosystem will accelerate. Okay. Perfect. That makes a lot of sense. I do want to switch gears a little bit now, moving away from the role of the foundation to talking about Polkadot as a whole and basically how Polkadot positions itself. So we''re all familiar with, like, you know, the parachain auctions that we had in the past. Now we kind of move to agile core time. Nowadays Polkadot is often described as the AWS of Web3, like a decentralized supercomputer on top of which all kinds of applications, decentralized applications can be built. What''s your mental model that you use to describe Polkadot? Yeah, I really like actually that metaphor of AWS, right? And I think one of the core developers of parity technologies recently also mentioned that, as well as, you know, Bitcoin is sort of brought the world calculator. Ethereum, basically the world computer and Polkadot will bring the world cloud or core, multi-core cloud, right? And if you think about it, this is really exciting. People will be able actually to create their own computer, to make their own computer, or even rent multiple computers and deploy their products and services. This is something that hasn''t been seen before. This is new. Yeah. What is also new is Jam. So Gavin Wood was here in Hong Kong the day before yesterday, on Monday. We had a big talk over at Cyberport. We were there as well. It''s part of the larger Jam tour. Obviously, Jam is a very complex technical upgrade to Polkadot. It''s a major upgrade, and I''m personally very excited about it. I always like to say Jam has not been priced in yet. But what actually is Jam? Like what''s in the simplest terms that you can use, how would you describe what it does and how it improves Polkadot? Yeah. So first of all, I have to admit I''m not an engineer, right? But, you know, I have listening at talk on Monday and kind of doing my deep devs into the reading and material that is out there. I have two takeaways basically. You know, with Jam, going forward, there is quite a difference to what Polkadot is doing right now. Polkadot is, you know, focusing on verifying blockchains right now. And going forward, Jam, with Jam, you can basically almost deploy anything you can imagine. Really products and services and even if I got it right, even kind of Web2 applications on Jam, right? Which is a breakthrough basically. Yeah. And, you know, going a little bit into the second factor or takeaway I have as non-engineer is that, you know, I believe there are kind of two clusters of blockchains currently. One is more the monolithic approach from a design approach where probably Solana is part of. Of course, with that monolithic approach, you have certain pros and cons. The cons are probably on the resilient side, decentralization that is not as strong. And if you want to visualize that, I always, you know, kind of talk about two horses actually drawing a carriage, right? And there are only two horses. Yeah. So, you know, there''s a single point of failure. And with Polkadot, we talk about more kind of the modular design approach with charting. And there you have something like 100 chickens drawing a carriage, right? And with these 100 chickens, you have a communication issue at the hands which goes back to the word coherence, I believe, you know. And what I believe is that, or my takeaway with Jam is that Jam will give actually something like a coordinating layer, coordination layer over everything. And the services can talk to each other and hook up with each other. And, you know, if they do not need to do that anymore, they basically separate, go back and come together again. And by doing so, actually, you get the best out of the two worlds, which is amazing, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You mentioned Jam will enable like a bunch of very new, very exciting applications. What actually are the verticals that you''re most excited about for Polkadot moving forward? Let''s focus on the current state first. I think, you know, I''m most excited about everything that needs high throughput, which, you know, the testing that we did end of year showed that Polkadot is capable to do so. We reached like, if I''m not mistaken, more than 140,000 throughput transactions per second, which is far better than any other protocol out there. And I also believe that more complex projects that need more kind of complex features are made for Polkadot, basically. And, you know, Polkadot actually is that protocol that should actually draw in these projects. Talking about what these projects are, I think that the verticals, for instance, gaming. Oh, that''s good. I''m always kind of interested in that part. Internet of things or AI. And if we talk about names, you know, for gaming, it''s, of course, mythical. Then hydration, our decks, I really like because of that, also because of that feature, which is called Omnipool, where we have an aggregated liquidity pool compared to other protocols, other projects that provide basically just a single asset to single asset liquidity pool. And, you know, kind of one of the emerging projects I like is Accarest, where, you know, the guys try actually to use mobile processing power for distributed computation. Perfect. I actually think this is a great place to wrap it up because it is a segue into our next session. You just mentioned a few of the interesting applications that are building on Polkadot at the moment and some of the new ones that are moving into the Polkadot space. So I think it''s a great transition to move to our panel, which is a panel of Polkadot builders and projects that are taking advantage of the Polkadot infrastructure. And they are coming on stage right now, moderated by Tommy. For now, I can say thank you very much, Thomas. Thank you. Thank you. Let me just summarize something. Sorry. Yeah. Let''s reiterate our claim. More truth, less trust, and hopefully going forward, guys, also less noise. Thank you. Perfect. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('a_blockchain_revolution__splitting_by_ultima_chain_opens_new_horizons', 'A Blockchain Revolution_ Splitting by Ultima Chain Opens New Horizons', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' My name is Alex Reinhardt. I''m a serial entrepreneur, investor, founder of many projects. And today we are here not to catch money or asking for investors or looking for some support. Today we are here like investors, like developers, and to invite also projects to support fundamental growth of the blockchain. Because guys, you know, the market, the crypto market right now is in a revolution stage. It means that, yeah, you can see what''s happening on the blockchain market right now. The alt season is out. Meme coins rocking everyone. Presidents of big countries starting on meme coins. And altcoins are very down all the time and nobody can understand anything because there''s nothing the same today like it was before. And it means the big, big crypto revolution is coming. Right now we have projects on the market on the one side who are fighting for fundamental business. And on the other side, they are just playing some games and trying just to collect money in the NFTs or meme coins or futures. And everything is one big, very interesting, but not really profitable game. And we are here. If we can see on the market, the market is growing. The number of projects is growing. Capitalization is growing. But there''s very low number of real business behind. Because, of course, we can play games and do a little bit gambling with cryptocurrency. But normal people need more business in the background where you can earn long term, stable money. Where you can not only win something to lose it later, where you can really create assets, where you really can create wealth. And one of the fundamental business, of course, is mining. And yeah, mining is, I think this is a base of all the crypto market, especially mining of Bitcoin. And yeah, normally all the fundamental projects, they focusing on the Bitcoin growth of the development of the Bitcoin. And the main coins on the market, they just following the trend. If the Bitcoin is going up, everyone going up. If Bitcoin goes down, everyone goes down. But for real investors and experts, this is not very interesting to invest in coins who are just following the trend. Because why to invest in these coins? You can straight invest in Bitcoin. They are all looking for cryptocurrencies who are not following the trend. Who can just explode and just can change the trend or they are following their own trend. These are opportunities where investors are looking for and the same opportunities we are looking for. Yeah, for projects who are able to survive in this very strong competition and offering really fundamental technology, ecosystem, idea. So if you have projects like this behind, we have our Ultima chain stand. Just come to our stand, let know each other and find the communication. And maybe something very interesting will happen. So we with Ultima creating also very big and strong fundamental ecosystem and fundamental project. And our goal is to combine mining, staking and we have invented additional way of business named splitting. Maybe you have never heard about splitting before. But this is very interesting technology where people can just generate their assets on the smartphone just with one click. Because, you know, the cryptocurrency is pretty difficult business. Very risky. You need very strong nerves. Yeah, you need to stay calm and you have to adopt any stress on the market. To balance any stress on the market. And the splitting technology is something what you can apply by everyone''s normal and regular purpose. You don''t need a special education for this. You don''t need a special knowledge. You just need a little bit of time a day, maybe three to five minutes just to click the button. What is splitting and what''s Ultima standing for? The Ultima is supporting the combination of mining, staking and splitting. It means it creating the absolutely full stage of business. What everyone can do just from home. This is very energy friendly. This is combined with lifetime rewards. It''s very important and very easy to use by just clicking off one button. So, how it''s working. It was created a liquidity pool in the blockchain. And this liquidity pool you just need to contact one time a day to get daily rewards. If you get these daily rewards, you can use them every day by exchanging on the exchange, by buying products, by uploading your card, by refreezing it again, to send it to staking, to use it by voting. Same like Tron doing by selling your energy resources or bandwidth resources on market. So, many, many use cases are given on the Ultima chain. This is very easy. This is very easy to use. You just have to freeze your coin and just click your button after 24 hours. And then everything in the background will be done automatically by blockchain itself. So, we have already many, many users. They clicking every day. And if they... Why it''s important to click in our ecosystem to produce transactions. You produce transaction, you burn gas, you freeze coins, you create demand, create liquidity. The price is growing. Just you know, if you go and right now to coin market cap, you will see incredible price. The Ultima coin is... The price of Ultima coin right now is rent about $20,000. Not 20 cents. Not $2. Not $200. Not $2,000. Not $2,000. $20,000 is the price of Ultima coin right now. So, and the project is already more than two years on the market. The technology will be used already by hundreds and thousands of people. And till end of this year, we''re expecting minimum 3 million users. Who are using this project together with us. The same technology what we''re using here, we are ready to share with other projects. That everyone can repeat the success of Ultima on his own product, on his own coin. And that everyone can apply the same technology for his own asset. Because the way is very easy. Just freeze, just click, just take reward and take benefit. Yeah, this is the way. Yeah, you just request the reward and receive the reward real time immediately. It''s taking just a few seconds. Yeah, the Ultima blockchain is running right now. So the Ultima chain is running not so long before we was working on different blockchain just because the Ultima was just a token. Now it became to a coin, to the mother coin. And of course, can be used as the gas fee, can be used for staking, for voting and promising pretty good rewards every day. Yeah, the Ultima coin was created for math adoption. It was created for easy usage. And especially, this should be an example how you can build up with your project, with your asset, really fundamental technology, fundamental business. Because behind Ultima, it''s not just the ecosystem, not just a coin. This is really fundamental business with debit cards, with hardware wallet, with marketplace, with more than 7 million goods on it, with freezing programs, with exchanges and of course, splitting technology and daily rewards. Yeah, this is again how it''s working. And this procedure you can apply on any token. Ultima is just an example. If you have any token and maybe you are in trouble, maybe you were pumped and now you are dumped and very low price. Then by applying of our technology, you can push your asset, push your token very high. And not like a pump, you can do it on a very logical, natural way and without any manipulation. Because this is the technology behind. You have only to create your own split. Your users have to freeze it, have to click it every day and have to take the reward daily. And so they will fall in love with your token and your community will grow so much more. In our ecosystem, we have a lot of projects and products. This is just a couple of them. We have our own wallets, we have our own marketplaces with millions of goods. We have our hardware wallets, our own debit card in physical and plastic in virtual version too. We have also our staking technology, pools, liquidity pools. And of course, marketplace for resources. Same like Drone Energy for example, where you can really profitable in real time, sell your energy, sell your bandwidth. Where you can create really business behind. And yeah, this is the most important. Not only play the gambling game in the cryptocurrency market. This is very important also to create fundamental business. What you can run for years and not only for days or months. So about Ultima chain, it''s not much to say. We are strictly, we have really strictly limited coin supply. We have smart contracts inside. The Ultima chain is running on delegated proof of stake technology. It''s around about 2 to 3 seconds what will be needed to create a block. It''s up to minimum 2,000 transactions per second. So very fast and very useful blockchain. And of course, our technology is providing utility to normal people. Because most of them, they don''t have the right education. They don''t have the right skills, knowledge. They are just dreaming about to come to the market and just do something very simple. And what can be more simple than just click one button a day. It''s very simple. Everyone can do this. Doesn''t matter in what culture or in what country this person is. So the Ultima coin is listed also already on Gate, Maxi, BingX, Bitmark. We are preparing tier 1 exchanges also. But this is only the beginning of the project and of the project. And yeah, listed on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko. You can see this live in your smartphone. As I told you already, yeah, to the time where the presentation was done, the price was 19,000. The highest price was 22,000. I think yesterday or two days before. Today it''s 20 something. It''s not so volatile a coin. It means for traders. It''s also very interesting. You can predict the price development. And this should be only an example. I''m not selling you something here or I''m not advertising here the Ultima coin to buy or something. I''m not. The price is $20,000. We don''t need to do this. But this should be an example how any other project can be successful on the crypto market and can survive if he applying the right strategy and right technology on his assets. So, of course, if the founder is really interested to run long term business or not only to pump the coin and then take the money and disappear in one, two weeks or months. So, yeah, the price is also very interesting after Bitcoin is the number two coin in the price growth and price development. Of course, we''re still in the position 200 because 200 plus because the listing on tier one exchanges is still not happened. But we''re working on it very hardly. But I think this year it will be done. We''re already in discussion with tier one exchanges. So, the trick behind or the know-how behind is the market. The basement on the hyper deflation. It means that coins if they starting the rally on crypto market they producing billions of tokens. They creating crazy rates of minting or farming of cryptocurrency. And they creating very big inflation. And the inflation is the biggest enemy of the price growing. So, we apply or we applying completely different strategy. We, yeah, we applying the strategy of hyper deflation. It means that every year the number of tokens about the halving, about the special procedures getting lesser and lesser and lesser on the market. If the supply is going down, the price is growing automatically. So, this methodology we have applied around about 10 months ago. That you know, the price of Ultima coin was in June of this year just $2,000. Now, 20 and 22. It''s 10x in just 10 months. Only because of this technology. And this technology we want to share with different projects. We can see a lot of them here. And I think many of them who will start the projects on our Ultima chain will succeed very fast and yeah, very big. Yeah, that''s it. Yeah, I''m almost in time. And yeah, the Ultima is just more than just a cryptocurrency. This is entire ecosystem. And again, we''re pretty big in Europe. We''re pretty big in Latin America. We''re pretty big in India. But in Asia not. And I hope that very soon I will see here not only a couple of people. I will see thousands and thousands. Normally I speak in front of 10, 15,000 people. But here I understand this is my first speech in Asia. And yeah, consensus. The Ultima is not very known here. But we will change it very soon. And I hope that next time if you see somewhere advertisement of Ultima, you''re remembering me. You''re remembering the chain. And you will be our guest because we will absolutely for sure come to Asia and Hong Kong especially. The next time also to next cities. So just if you''re interested in cooperation, if you''re looking for also investors. And if you''re looking for opportunity to grow your business idea. Behind is the Ultima chain stand. So just join us and speak to my colleague, to my team. And yeah, let''s stay in contact. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.', 'My name is Alex Reinhardt.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('bf2df39722', 'Fireside: BitGo', '待定', 'Fireside Chats', ' I''m Tom Farley. I''m the CEO of Bullish. This morning, I''m proud to tell you that as part of Bullish, we own the CoinDesk slash Consensus business. I have the best colleagues in crypto who have put on this conference. What a tremendous success. It''s so awesome to be here. In my day job as the Bullish CEO, we run a global crypto exchange. And we have a, I believe our largest office is here in Hong Kong with just amazing colleagues. And in fact, late last night, we received the full license to operate as a crypto exchange types one and seven from the SFC here in Hong Kong, which were. So thanks to Julia, Elizabeth or others from the SFC for putting up with us for the better part of two years. We''re excited to bring global liquidity, really unique way we did it, where we''re going to onboard customers here. We''re going to keep the custody here and provide access to a global pot of liquidity. So anyway, that''s enough about me. The reason why I''m excited here is I''m with crypto OG. I''m going to call him Mike Belshi. And I say that because he was just telling me the origin story of BitGo from 2011. And he referred to, you know, I was talking to these OGs of crypto. And I''m thinking to myself, you''re an OG of crypto. So 2011, he started BitGo. Fast forward. Here we are 2025. BitGo is, I''ll call it the premier custodian for crypto globally. And they''re doing a number of other things. I''ll refer to them as a custodian, but it''s a broader business, as you''ll hear. And for full disclosure, Bullish has used BitGo as our principal custody solution from our outset. We have some other things we''ll do in terms of custody. But they''ve been a great partner. So I am a little bit biased up here as a moderator. I''m not up here as a journalist because I love Mike. I love the business. And so you know where I''m coming from. So with that, let''s get started. Mike, wow. I don''t even know where I want to start. There''s so much fun going on in crypto. Let''s start with the nuts and bolts. Can you give a sense to the audience? What do you see for just, in general, the custody business writ large, both for BitGo, but writ large as an industry over the next year or two? Let''s start generic. Sure, sure. Well, thank you, Tom, by the way. Thank you guys for being clients, partners. You''ve been fabulous for a long time. By the way, the bullish team probably stressed us the most in terms of verifying the underlying technology is fully recoverable without BitGo at all. So the whole point of what we do is we start with this security layer of two out of three, multi-sig, MPC. But no matter what, it''s always two out of three, which protects against theft and loss. You guys test all of that stuff, and you make sure that we''re doing it right. So anyway, thank you for being great clients. Let''s see. In terms of where custody is going, custody, I think, is kind of this thing that''s mostly behind the scenes. People don''t really see it that much. They think of it as a commoditized business. They think it''s going to run exactly like State Street, like BNY, kind of these types of guys. And look, in the traditional markets, which are very established over decades, you can see why people think that way. But crypto is just getting started, right? So I did my first kind of market structure chat with JPMorgan executives probably around 2016. And I come from the technology world. I come from the crypto world. You outline what''s going on in the CFTC world. You know, you''ve got your DCMs in the middle. You''ve got your FCMs on the side. And in the equities world, you''ve got your brokers. You''ve got your exchanges. You''ve got your clearings parties, et cetera. And then in crypto, you''ve got like one guy. And he acts, oh, I''m bullish, right? It acts like the client''s broker, like the seller''s broker, the buyer''s broker puts it all together. Custody and market structure for crypto is just getting started. So as a result, you know, custody''s got a lot of work to do. It''s not a commoditized thing. We do a ton of R&D, as evidenced by, you know, the thousands of coins that are constantly coming through. And every single one of them needs a lot of new work, right? So anyway, with custody, we do staking at the bottom. I''m sorry, we do wallets at the bottom. We do custody above that. And then on top, we do services. So staking, trading, borrow, lend, settlement services, tri-party collateral management. We have GoUSD, actually, a stable coin coming very soon. When I look at custody for other asset classes, the custodians, the main custodians, no matter what asset class we go through all around the world, are these gigantic companies. So they''re typically trust companies or banks with $100 billion balance sheets. Is that what''s going to happen in crypto? So, you know, are we going to see more of those types of players come in to challenge BitGo? Look, I''ve been getting that question since around 2016. I remember meeting with Abby Johnson and Fidelity back in those early days when they were just getting started. Look, the traditional world is going to start with Bitcoin, and extending into other assets is pretty difficult for them. As evidenced by, you know, you look at the Fidelity offering today, which is a great offering. It''s got the full faith of, you know, the Fidelity balance sheet behind it. So that''s got an appeal, and it''s got a market that it hits. It hasn''t really affected our business. It turns out, you know, the ETF business, you know, just like for the asset managers, you know, the ETF business, they don''t make the bulk of their money off of the ETFs, right? Now, it''s an important part of what they do. It''s good money. They like it. But, you know, it''s all the other stuff that they do, and the same thing is true with us. So we support all of these assets, all of these tokens. We support them in a number of contexts that traditional finance can''t do. We''re global. You know, most of those companies are kind of U.S.-centric. First, they do hit internationally, but, you know, we continue to duck and weave with the changes in innovation in a way that they don''t. Let''s pivot. We''re a couple of Americans up here on the stage, for better or for worse. Terrible. Why don''t we give – oh, hi, Elizabeth. Why don''t we provide a little bit of insight in terms of what''s going on in our home country? Mike and I had breakfast in May of 2024, and we were lamenting the terrible state of regulation and enforcement in the U.S. You know, a regulated environment''s fine, an unregulated environment''s fine, but an opaque environment with lawsuits flying around where you don''t know what to do is really just agonizing. And we didn''t see really any end in sight. So now let''s fast forward. It''s mid-February. What''s the state of play in the United States in terms of regulatory, perhaps possible legislation we''ll see this year? And in general, how are you feeling? Well, like, it really couldn''t be any better. It''s like we went to sleep, woke up, and we just had, like, the most amazing dream ever. So not only did we get kind of what we were hoping for, which is a president that put in some regulators that didn''t want to kill us. That''s really all we wanted. It''s a pretty low bar. Instead, we got a president that''s deep in on crypto, regulators that are all in our crypto, whether you''re talking Paul Atkins going into the SEC, Brian Kintens going into the CFTC, used to be a board member at BitGo Trust Company. We got David Sachs, an investor at BitGo. He''s the crypto AIs are. Like, it really couldn''t be better. But I think if you want to relate it outside the U.S. a little bit, it''s also really good globally. So we have seven custodians. We operate around the world. We got Switzerland. We got Germany, Dubai, Singapore, Korea. So we talk to regulators everywhere. And, you know, frankly, the regulators do look in all of these countries. They do look to the U.S. for guidance, for better or worse. And the U.S. being pro-crypto makes it so much easier for them to be pro-crypto as well. So this is going to be fantastic in terms of opening up markets globally, not just in the U.S. And what about legislation this year? Are you expecting to see legislation come out of Congress that will clarify, you know, I don''t know, basic things like what''s a security? What isn''t a security? Who can issue a security? What sort of transparency do they provide? Any thoughts? Look, the team that''s there feels they''ve been dealt a totally winning hand in terms of the ability to get things through. So not only do you have Trump, of course, you''ve got the House and the Senate controlled by the Republicans. So there''s an opportunity to make real change. So they are ready to go. They''re ready to do stablecoin legislation. They''re ready to do whole new regulated regimes in addition to the CFTC and the SEC. That might be good. That might be bad. It could take a little bit of time. But they are ready to go make big changes for sure. Let me ask you a question a little bit off topic. A topic du jour. I woke up this morning and a colleague of mine, Danny Nelson, had broke an amazing story, a bit scary, that Javier Malay, the gentleman who launched this Libra stablecoin, had sent a text saying that he was bribing Malay''s sister, effectively, paying Malay''s sister. And he had Malay in his pocket. And this is part of why Malay was advocating for this stablecoin that ultimately resulted in great losses. Why am I asking you about that? BitGo has typically been a quality over quantity in terms of tokens. I know that as a customer. What are your thoughts on the rise of memecoin trading, the proliferation of memecoin trading, given the pros and cons? Do you see it ultimately as a good thing for digital assets and capital formation? Is BitGo looking to get into more memecoin custody or businesses? Any thoughts on this? Look, we just want to be a great custodian and service provider. So people get to pick what assets they deem are quality or not quality. Obviously, we do diligence on everything. Our regulators require us to do a pretty lengthy form. By the way, AI helps with filling out those forms. But they require us to do a lengthy evaluation of everything that we list. We''re still able to list memecoins, and we do that for folks that want it. My personal opinion, however, look, we have global markets, and you cannot put the genie back into the bottle. So people all over the planet are creating new stuff every day. And the innovation is so fast, you know, bullish is having trouble keeping up with it. BitGo''s having trouble keeping up with it. The regulators, they''re having trouble just watching it, right? So there''s so much change. What I fear is that we could have an overreaction from the legislators and the regulators. The reality is, you know, with the Malay coin, there''s a bunch of retail folks that were damaged. And, you know, people love to brag when they win a bet. But when they lose a bet, they''re like, who do I blame? And I fear that we could see regulators try to close things down. And then that actually could hurt for global markets. I mean, one of the best things about digital assets and blockchains and all this that we''re doing is we''re able to connect markets globally that we''ve never done before. So unfortunately, the meme coins, you know, they could lead to regulatory retaliation, which I think would set us back. I hope that that doesn''t happen. I think most of us here probably hope that doesn''t happen. But look, we''ll see. This is the yin and the yang of regulatory versus innovation. I did an interview with Annabelle of Bloomberg Asia this morning, and she said, Tom, there was an article saying that bullish was contemplating an IPO in the United States. Can you tell us more? And I was squirming in my chair because you can only say so much about IPOs or you''re violating regulations. So it''s kind of fun. I get to turn the tables. Mike, I read an article that BitGo is contemplating an IPO. Tell us more. Very clever. Look. Much more fun to be on this side. Let me just say it this way. The mission statement of BitGo is delivering trust in digital assets. You know, in the early days, it was about technology. Like, you know, how do you secure these assets in a way that, you know, you''re not going to get rug pulled, protects against loss of passwords or hard disks and all this. And so we pioneered that. Eventually, we added this regulatory layer. How do you do it in a compliant way? We do that globally. But that delivering trust, you keep doing it. Look, one of the things I think in order to address Wall Street, you''ve got to be a public company. And we''re seeing this where some companies on Wall Street in particular, look, they tried to interface with private companies, Silicon Valley due diligence companies like FDX. That didn''t work out so well, right? So they''ve learned that, like, diligence really matters. And the SEC process, the SEC diligence, the oversight, I think, is a key part of delivering trust. So it''s in the destiny. And then I''ll not comment on timeline. Yeah. Just for what it''s worth, I completely agree with you. I mean, we''re in the digital assets industry, which is doing really great things. And that''ll be my next question for you about some of those great things. But let''s face it, there''s still a little bit of that negative sense from this flush out of frauds and charlatans that we saw. And I think anything that you can stack up, a balance sheet, which you have, a big four auditor, which we both have, really credible regulators. I''m not just saying that because of present company. But, you know, we got a German license. And we see institutional customers on the other side go, oh, OK, that''s good. And I completely agree. I think a listing on a public, very well-respected market is a great thing because it demonstrates your willingness to be transparent about your financials. And it provides a lot of confidence. Look, our job is to provide confidence to our clients and continue to provide innovation. Right. And sometimes it seems like those don''t go well together. And I think the traditional system, you know, back to that conversation I had with J.P. Morgan. Yeah, after I explained to them about the differences in market structure, they were very happy. They were light bulbs going off in their heads. You can see that. I asked them, I''m like, why am I telling you guys this? You guys are J.P. Morgan. Like, you know this thing in the back of your hand. Look, they''ve gotten to a point in traditional finance where, you know, the market structure is the way it is. And they don''t think about how regulation could be or what market structure could be that would be better. Instead, they think that''s the way it is and how do they get their job done. I think in our industry, we''ve got systems thinkers. We''ve got programmers. We''ve got, you know, folks that are rethinking, like, how would you rebuild these markets now that you have computers? Because remember, SEC started before we had computers, right? But we can change everything, of course, for the more efficient, of course, for the more transparent. So our job is to make sure that continues to happen while also meeting, you know, some of the legacy rules and regulations and hopefully some of that changes in Washington in the coming months. So I want to close on probably my favorite topic in digital assets right now, which is the rise of stablecoins globally. For those of you who haven''t been paying attention, stablecoins have gone from around about $5 billion of market cap four and a half years ago to $200 billion today. And this is my view. What''s that? Not too shabby. That''s not too shabby. And my view is it will go to $2 trillion in the next two or three years. That''s my view. And quite frankly, maybe even higher. And when Mike and I work on, when our companies work together or even when Mike and I are backstage, we''re often talking about stablecoins. We''re both kind of nerding out about the potential there. But why don''t you share some of your thoughts on why they''re working, where you think it goes from here, and what is BitGo in particular doing, which I think is exciting? Look, I think it was kind of an overlooked innovation when it first came out. Tether deserves a lot of credit for having Bitfinex, for having driven that in the early days. But it''s just so clear at this point that it''s a better payment system. Look, the payment system, even outside of crypto, has been lacking from the banking sector for a long time. And you know this because the younger generation is switching over to Venmo. They''re switching over to Cash App. They''re switching over to WeChat Pay and other things. Banks could have had that role, but they didn''t. When it comes to stablecoins, runs 24-7. I actually am, I think, more bullish than you are on stablecoins. And we have, on Bias, we have our own, GoUSD. I think the stablecoins are the bank you wish you had, but you never did have. So people are now starting to learn how money works a little bit more. A bank is a depository. They take your money and they lend it out. Sometimes that works out pretty well. And we have some big institutions that have navigated it for a long time. There''s a whole bunch of institutions that died along the way. SVB was one of the scary ones not too long ago, Signature, Suffrogate. Banks take risks with your money. Stablecoins are 100% reserve in federal T-bills. When you put money in the bank today, how much interest do you get? 0.1%? T-bills get 4.5%. Why? Because the banks don''t need the money. They''ve got more money than they know how to lend out right now. All right. So I think stablecoins are going to be able to fill all of this. It''s actually what you wanted from your banking system. It runs 24-7. It''s all yours. It''s like cash. It''s a whole bunch of attributes. It''s just a win. Excellent. Well, two things in closing. One, thank you again for being here. We don''t take it for granted that you''re taking out of your time and your budget to be here at ConsenSys. Really, really fun start to this conference. I''ll be here for the next couple days and would love to meet any of you. Number two, please provide a warm round of applause for somebody who''s not just here on the stage giving us his insights, which were fabulous, but has really been toiling away to move the digital assets industry forward for the better part of 14 years now. Mike Belshi, thank you very much.

It''s called Concealing the Chain. My name is Liz Peng. I''ll be moderating. I''m head of communications and marketing at Sella Foundation. We''re stewards of an emerging Ethereum L2 that stewards a thousand projects in over 150 countries, all geared towards real world users and use cases. And it is my distinct pleasure to welcome Perina, founder of Flickplay, a Web3 consumer app that is merging physical and digital worlds, as well as Ahmed, founder of KID, KYD, who is also sort of transforming the ticketing journey for artists and brands. And very excited to be here. Would love for you to also sort of introduce yourselves. Ahmed, why don''t you kick us off? Yeah. Hey, so my name is Ahmed Amali, co-founder and CEO of KID Labs. Prior to founding KID Labs, I was a product leader at Ticketmaster Live Nation, where famously our namesake came from in a meeting where my goal was to be able to push data ownership and rights to venues that were going out of business in the pandemic. Michael Rapinoe responded with, who the fuck is this KID? So that is the story and beginning of what we do at KID Labs, which is enabling artists in major venues to sell, market to their fans effectively, and creating a world where fans are rewarded for going to shows instead of being gouged by service fees. To date, we''ve serviced over 500,000 fans in the U.S. and are the world''s first Web3 ticketing company to take a music venue from an incumbent, DICE. Awesome. Perina? Hello, everyone. My name is Perina, and I''m the founder and CEO of Flickplay. My background is at the intersection of design and technology, a recovering architect, but with a very strong vision on how design and technology will build the next generation of human experiences. At Flickplay, we believe that maps are poised to become the new app store for online to offline experiences, and Flickplay as a platform is partnering with the top entertainment studios in the world to power it. Amazing. So in thinking through sort of concealing the chain, what we mean by that is instead of sort of leading with protocol infrastructure, talking about scalability, vertical and horizontal or infra and market cap and prices, we really want to focus on how do you actually design and build and create these sort of seamless user experiences for the everyday user, who is really, for lack of better words, not going to care, right? So we''d love to hear from each of you what concealing the chain sort of means to you and your respective roles. Maybe Perina, do you want to start? Yes, absolutely. I think that this is a conversation we have a lot with all of our IP partners. And for us, it''s really creating a seamless experience where the technology really is invisible for consumers. And one of the things that Bandai Namco told us when we were exploring a partnership with them is that oftentimes in Web3, people don''t really understand what community is and people think that they will come to them and tell them how to foster community when they have communities that they have foster over 40 years, right, for each of their IP. So when we really think about concealing the chain, we really think about how can we make the experience seamless. And within Flickplay specifically, we focus on the interoperability layer. How can we enable consumers to unlock digital characters in real world locations that are connected to the culture and enable its interoperability across an open ecosystem of games and experiences? So how does that evolve the next generation of stamp collecting? How does that evolve the next generation of connecting retail experiences with gaming experiences, which normally within studios are totally fragmented? And how blockchain technology actually enables that? Sure. Amazing. Ahmed, what about you? Yeah. So music venues and artist managers are the most skeptical people on the planet. They''re distrustful of everything. So at KID, our goal was to deliver an experience that not only was more seamless than existing players like Dice and Ticketmaster, but one where fans can easily buy tickets. Simply that''s the goal. Simply that''s the goal. And second piece where we''re actually driving additional return on spend or metrics to venues in a way they can digest. Success for us was being able to get music venues and artists who are distrustful to trust us. And ultimately what that means is being able to deliver experience that''s not only better for fans and easier to transact on and convert on, but is also more robust from a data and storytelling perspective. There''s no excuse in my belief as a Web 3 or Web 2 company and consumer to not deliver an experience that creates value for your customers. Right. And yeah, that''s our thinking and our stance. So I guess maybe just to add to that, like why blockchain for you, right? Yep. Why this particular sort of technology? So the craziest thing and the reason why Ticketmaster today has such a stronghold on music venues and artists is because that music venues traditionally can''t get loans. When you''re a venue, your ticketing company is traditionally your financier. It''s a form of factoring. So Ticketmaster has created basically these long tail deals with a lot of music venues by giving them up from capital to produce their shows and guarantee artists'' tours. It is absolutely critical for us to succeed against Ticketmaster by providing decentralized capital to venues, enabling stable coin depositors or what we call patrons to be able to fund and produce, enabling venues to take those loans out and produce the shows they need while providing yield back to those lenders. So why is blockchain useful? It''s a way of banking the unbankable and music venues today are traditionally some of those that face that issue. Right. So I''m hearing ownership, the ability to sort of deploy capital, funding mechanisms. It''s a ticketing platform owned by the fans, the artists, the people. Love that. Right. And that''s the core behind it. By the people for the people. Right. Parina, what are some of the thorny problems that you''re sort of encountering and aiming to solve for with Flickplay? Yes. So on one side, I could say on the business side with the partnership with our IP partners, currently their retail business and their gaming or digital business are completely fragmented. They''re normally run by different teams with different goals and business initiatives. Sure. And this creates a natural bottleneck for consumers because a true fan of Pac-Man or Mickey Mouse that is going to a retail experience, they can''t really connect with how that franchise is developing or connecting digital experience for it. I think that when we think about the concept of Ready Player One and the ability for you to go to a store, buy something and that something enables a digital experience that enhances your connection with the franchise. That''s a user journey that currently is broken. So as a platform that connects to real role and where the culture and the connection with the IP is foster, we''re able to channel those audiences and power the distribution to their digital initiative. Right. And from a consumer standpoint, we see more and more the desire of fans wanting to connect with the community, but right now don''t really know how to, because you would get surprised of how little one-to-one connections, our franchises or the partners that we work with have a direct connection with them and instead they''re going to Meta or to, I would say, Web2 social platforms to pay to be able to connect with their fans. So we''re creating a one direction for them. I love that. So I''m hearing a lot of fostering connection, community and really leveraging that. Great. So I guess another sort of question for you all since, you know, this talk is about concealing the chain and, you know, sort of hiding the wires. How are you all sort of speaking to your communities or talking about crypto and blockchain without speaking about crypto and blockchain? Maybe Ahmed, you could sort of share some insights on that front. It was kind of funny. One of our venue customers actually hit us up and said, we should do a meme coin. And it''s funny because a lot of our customers starting off didn''t know we were on chain. Right. And then they would look us up and like, oh, you guys are on Aptos. Oh, what is this? And that came from the fact that we were delivering on our promise, which was making them more money and selling more tickets. And by that, they were all comfortable in asking about these foreign concepts and how we can help them use that to make more money. Now, when it comes down to it, we don''t have the conversation when we''re building a relationship with our customers around the blockchain and the crypto components because it doesn''t matter. What they care about is how am I going to sell more tickets? How am I going to fill my room and how am I as a venue or an artist going to make sure I reach my fans? And then when that conversation is complete and we''re being successful at that, how can we now leverage this crypto component that Kidd has to now drive a further wedge, whether it be financing or whether it be, you know, trying out new things? Yeah. Traditionally, like it''s a conversation we have after. Yeah. Yeah. Go ahead. The short answer is we done. Yeah. And I think that that''s where the beauty is. We really focus on the mainstream adoption of Web3. Yes. But basically powering the foundational value that we find in blockchain, which is interoperability is a global identity for consumers. So one of the aha moments that we had, we started as a Web2 platform. And in 2019, we had this aha moment once we did our first wallet integration and in-game assets from platforms like the sandbox were able to migrate to our platform and became part of the experience. And that''s really why we believe that blockchain really enables this interconnection of experiences and culture that traditional gated ecosystems don''t really allow. And so one of the aha moments that we had with our community is that at this point consumers can''t trade inside the platform. But we created a very seamless experience for users to win custody of their wallet and trade it somewhere else. And we see within the community portals in our platform people teaching each other how can you go to OpenSea and trade that specific asset with someone else. Right. And I think like these are genuine ways for us to onboard people into Web3 without really tapping into the speculative layer that normally breaks fan base. Absolutely. And just sort of erodes trust, I would say, fundamentally. And I think something we were talking about even before sort of coming on stage, too, is just, you know, not over indexing on sort of leading with the engineering and the infrastructure. And to your point, Ahmed, it''s incredible. People don''t even realize you''re on chain because that experience is really great for artists. And to your point, to not speak about it. And then all of a sudden organically you have these conversations taking place where people are then interested in, OK, I''m onboarded. I may be slightly pilled. What''s next? Like how else can I go on and explore this sort of technology layer? Right. Yeah. Cool. Something that you had mentioned, Ahmed, that I love is just meeting your audience where they are. And I know that''s something that you do as well in Japan with all these different localized activations and content. How are you building trust with them and, you know, in your sort of respective communities beyond, yeah, just the technology itself? Yeah, I have actually two examples of that. One of our partners is Bratz, which is a doll''s IP and they are the most followed toy brand on TikTok. Cool. So when we launched that collection or onboarded that IP into our product, we went where the fans were. They would go to TikTok to watch the miniseries and connect with the IP there, right? And through our partnership with MDA, we start tackling that audience, really understanding how they engage in the comments segment. How could we actually, as a platform that explores the next generation of toys digitally, could actually connect with them through an authentic experience? Cool. So we started using TikTok as a channel to connect authentically with them. And on the other side, when it comes to our location-based real-world experiences, we localized FlickPlay in Japan about a week ago in partnership with the city of Shibuya and Bandai Namco. And it was the perfect location and the perfect IP considering that we''re celebrating this year Pac-Man''s 45th anniversary. And the first time that Pac-Man was played was in Shibuya 45 years ago. Very cool. So the idea of bringing fans to the location that has so much nostalgia for them and connecting them with a culturally relevant experience in a city that they''re familiarized with, was that entry point for us to onboard them into a Pac-Man experience that now transcends Shibuya into the digital realm. I love that. So it''s kind of funny. Like most people in New York that have used KID have learned about it from their favorite artist. It''s, you know, if you''re seeing a show for the Lemonheads or you''re seeing a show for DoD, one of our venue customers does 300 shows a year. And on average, that''s a thousand people per show. And the artist is spending anywhere from 20% of 30% of their ticket sales on promoting their show on TikTok and Instagram. When a customer buys a ticket and validates it, it validates it on chain. Their account is a wallet. And I like to say in New York, most normies that have an actual wallet on chain, it''s probably because of us. So going back to meeting fans where they are, you know, we do a good job at that because we do a good job at making our artists and venues successful at marketing and reaching their fans. And by doing that, it creates that flywheel of onboarding the next generation of fans. We meet our venues at their conferences, whether it be Polestar or it be NEVA, the National Independent Venue Association. Just because we''re a Web3 company in music doesn''t mean that we can''t or should not be going to those conferences. We make it a thing to be there and educate and meet them as venues where they are at their conferences in a language they understand. So that''s how we found success in that method. Incredible. I love that. How are we thinking through? I mean, I think gone are the days in the last cycle. We were all there when people were signing these sort of banner partnerships and maybe with, you know, these sort of like enterprise brand deals that, you know, didn''t necessarily, you know, come to full fruition. And, you know, I think it''s a totally different time that we''re in in the industry. And, Purina, you guys are still doing it, right? Like building trust even with enterprise, you know, companies and brands. How has that experience been? Yeah, it''s a long, long term game. I think that Web3 platforms or Web3 builders underestimate how long it takes to create a paradigm shift with a new technology stack. And I think that year after year, I started Flick Play in 2019. And year after year, we see that every year is a year of something new, right? You have the year of AR, the year of NFTs and blockchain, and you have the year of VR, and now is the year of AI. But the way we really think about technology and convey to our partners is it''s not really about you being bucket as a Web3 platform, but how you''re leveraging all these technologies horizontally to create a better experience for their fans. So when we create that connection with our enterprise partners, we really sell them in that five year roadmap of innovation and disruption that we''ll bring for the company rather than that promise of an overnight success for them. Yeah, and I think it''s better that way. You have folks who are genuinely committed, right? And thinking through a real partnership. Ahmed, what about you guys? I got like a hot take on the partnership stuff. I hear it. Always here for a hot take. My take is this. I believe that you have customers and partners that pay you to do what you''re doing if you have something valuable. I think gone are the days where we''re seeing these amazing big brand deals, but now we''re seeing consumer projects actually being used by these big brands or big venues. And if you''re generating revenue off of that, I think that is what a successful relationship looks like. Right. And ultimately, if a brand or a partner cares about what you''re building, they''re going to pay for it. And that''s my two cents there. No, absolutely. And I think just in speaking earlier this, you''re also thinking through very thoughtfully about KID and how you guys show up as a company and raise money. And I think that''s very admirable. Let''s talk a little bit about adoption and geographies and markets. I know you guys are in respective U.S. and Asia in particular and North America for you as well. How are you seeing the adoption shift? Are there any surprises? No. Yeah, I think that depends on the vertical that you gravitate on. Certain markets have natural more adoption than others. And we see in Japan specifically the rising of virtual influencers in ways that in the U.S. is just not there yet. And that emotional connection with virtual beings which led into it becoming a critical market for flick play. I remember when Bandai Namco originally reached out to us, they couldn''t believe that we had not been yet exposed to Japan or Korea as a market because of how ideal the product was for their consumer. So that we have a huge focus in Asia and it has really become a magnet just because of the readiness of consumers for the experience that we provide. Rather than the U.S., we typically see the U.S. kind of catching up to some of the digital trends after a few years that they evolve in Asia. And that''s why we have put a focus in here and we launched last week in Japan and it was an absolutely incredible experience that we''re looking to expand with different cities and different local institutions. Right. How are you guys thinking through sort of markets and places? I''m really hoping, you know, we''re seeing a lot of regulatory changes in the U.S. and we''re banking on that. You know, our focus is U.S. venues, helping U.S. artists and scaling into Asia once we find effectively we own a tour out. So owning multiple venues, multiple exclusive deals across, you know, primary markets, New York, L.A., so forth. It''s expensive as a crypto company in the U.S. The cost of legal is insane and it hurts us. Right. So I''m super excited with this, you know, with this new government in place. I''m hoping that, you know, it makes it easier for a Delaware C Corp to go and actually, you know, launch a token, be able to have clear regulatory guidelines. I think that''s what I''m excited about. And, you know, our team is looking forward to seeing what happens in the next six, 12 months. Awesome. I think just to sort of shift gears a little bit, I would love to sort of talk about, you know, separate of our respective projects, maybe some of your favorite real world use cases or consumer crypto use cases that, you know, you''re seeing pop up that have been sort of successful or even if more niche than mainstream. We''d love to sort of hear about it. Maybe Perina, if you want to share. I think that connected but disconnected to flick play as a platform. I really love how different companies are exploring digital as an experience. I think that that idea of connecting, exploring the future of play and how today technology allow us to bring to life and materialize in the form of videos. It''s what you normally just imagine, right, as you play with physical toys. And I think Polly Penguin is doing a great job of creating that bridge of connection between physical toys and digital collecting and experience. And I just think that it''s just like the start of creating a seamless on-ramp into the digital realm. Right. So I''m really excited to see how that vertical continues to evolve. Cool. So the intersection of physical and digital. Ahmed, what about you? I''m really into David versus Goliath stories. So similar to us going up against Ticketmaster, I think what Helium is doing, Helium Mobile is doing with telecommunication companies and just mediating that is super interesting and we''re watching them closely. I''m also excited to see some infrastructure plays in consumer that I think are exciting. Opacity with ZKTLS. I think being getting those proofs on chain so that data can be used to, you know, do different things, whether it be underwriting or it be effectively getting as your past following on chain and notarized in a way that makes sense. I think that''s going to be super supportive for consumer social five products in the future. Yeah. Helium is I''m a huge fan of Helium. Very cool. Yeah, I think for me it''s I''m very bullish on sort of stable coins and stable assets and on Sello we have this incredible sort of use case. It''s a very seamless, easy to onboard sort of dollar digital, you know, savings wallet called MiniPlay and built by the Opera sort of browser team, which is really incredible. I think there''s like five million sort of users right now and it''s just awesome to see. And then I would say the other thing that I love is Blackbird. I think for those of us living in New York and, you know, it''s a former founder of Resi who, yeah, you can just go to really incredible restaurants and sort of build up loyalty points. And it''s it''s really sort of neat. Loyalty is super interesting. Yeah, definitely. And I think that''s certainly a really awesome layer that we''ve seen a few projects kind of come and go, but for sure interesting to sort of leverage blockchain tech on that front. Any trends and predictions that you can sort of share any alpha for the audience, at least in terms of, yeah, maybe where you''re seeing the industry headed? I think this is a very not partial opinion, but I really think that the breakthrough of consumer products are about to come. I think that we see we were talking this backstage where for the past two years we see so much investment and focus go to infrastructure and as consumer products. And we''re actually focusing on building what they''re not building because they don''t really most of them don''t really understand the true use cases for which we need infrastructure. And but we''re getting to a point that the companies are managing to actually lead these two verticals of infrastructure and consumer facing technology. We''re getting to a point where it''s becoming seamless. And I think that I mean, we''re two two cases, but there are many companies that are at our same stage. And I think that we''re going to see a rise of new consumer products that are going to start bringing Web3 mainstream. I absolutely agree. I would even go to the fact that I think institutional institutional investors and sophisticated investors are trying to find strong consumer brands that they can align themselves with. I think, yeah, again, make make meme coins and all that. You know, the the hysteria around that is great. But somebody is left holding the bag. I think when you''re looking at real world use cases and cases that are already generating revenue, I think that''s going to be the thing that''s going to make long term. Like those were the long term bets are going to be. We''ve seen that with circle. We''ve seen this with right, you know, the adoption of stable coins. This is where the excitement should be. But ultimately, it goes back to it. I''m very biased on this, but I think the real stuff is going to stay. And a lot of the cats or hats or whatever the heck is going to fade off. Yeah, absolutely. So, yes, I love sort of thinking through it''s, you know, protocol village stage should sort of merge with this one. But yeah, no, absolutely. I think we have a few more minutes and we wanted to sort of open up the conversation to anyone in the audience who might have a question for our panelists. Feel free to sort of raise your hand. I think there we''ve got some folks with a microphone. Any takers? There is so much light. Feel free to sort of raise your hand. I think, you know, in lieu of that, would love to sort of share sort of in summary or closing, you know, in lieu of questions, maybe a one key sort of takeaway for the audience or maybe one key sort of Web3 wish that you''d like to see change. I think that just instill a sense of responsibility. I think that there are so many builders out there that are really focusing on bringing the technology mainstream and doing things right. And I think that every day we learn something whenever we feel that we clear the path for companies to really enter the front door with their head up and with a sense of pride for the people. And pride for being building the space. We see more and more headlines of bad actors that continue to compromise the space. So I really invite everyone to think responsibly about not their short but long term commitment to the technology and the space that they are building on, because I do believe that we have a massive opportunity to make and disrupt a consumer. And I think that''s how we engage in the world. But that needs to we need to break through the bias. I think regulation will help. Yeah, but yeah, that''s if I were to like leave takeaways, it''s like don''t try to solve the hot problem. Try to solve the hard problems. Yeah, may focus on your core business fundamentals. Those will serve you every single time revenue users and and quantifying that. And finally, you know, crypto should be a flywheel to help you achieve something in your product that is going to help you go up against existing competitors or drive a flywheel. I find that we see a lot of things looking a lot of solutions looking for problems. And I really do believe building consumers really hard and you''re doing it right. You''re solving a problem and you''re focusing on your fundamentals and ultimately with crypto and with these use cases, you should be able to find flywheels that will go help you go from one to 100. Yeah, like I really do believe that this especially now and what we''ve seen in the past four or five years that we''re entering the age of real world use cases, consumer use cases that make sense and builders that are hungry and are looking to win in a world that''s rapidly changing. Amazing. So be thoughtful, mindful, operate responsibly and the next sort of killer dap and use cases among us. And hopefully it''s kid or flick play. Both. Both. Thanks, everybody.

And scale means a lot of different things that we''ll get into this afternoon. I''ll have our panelists introduce themselves. Quickly, I''ll be your moderator for today. I''m Camilla McFarland. I work leading strategy at G20 Group, a global asset manager, market maker, treasury manager, firm, also a venture partner at Fabric Ventures on the VC side. So we work with lots of different projects and lots of different parts of the ecosystem. I spent most of my career at Serotonin, the leading Web3 marketing firm, and also a consensus in the Ethereum community in the early days. And I''ll pass it over to Matt Senix from the Magic Eden Foundation. Hi, everybody. I''m Matt, EMI Foundation. And I lead the foundation, which is the steward of the protocols that power Magic Eden. And before that, I was a business lead at Magic Eden for the last three years. Hi, my name is Justin. I''m head of Asia for Alva Labs, overseeing business development and ecosystem in Asia. So I think my major involvement was MapleStory Universe out of Korea. There''s Suntory and there are financial institutions. So we''re all about scaling crypto projects. So we''re excited to be here. Great. Amazing. Well, we are hearing from a layer one blockchain today and also sort of wallet market infrastructure. So different parts of the stack. To start us off and to frame the discussion, what are the key ingredients for scaling? So what are the must-haves for scaling a project? And if you will, what are the biggest mistakes some teams make? Either one of you, feel free to jump in. Oh, man. So many mistakes that we''ve made, honestly, in the past, like, three years. And they''re, like, good mistakes because, like, we obviously learned a lot. But I think some of the core ingredients, and I''m thinking back to the early days, is choosing that early team really wisely. And it''s, you know, the early team sort of shapes the culture of the growing team so much. And I''ve learned this from the founders, too, and watching the company grow over the years. The folks that stay do shape the culture. So I think it''s sort of, like, a soft, you know, thing and, like, hard to measure. But finding, like, these culture carriers early on that could still have the vision so many years later is super, super important. A lot of that comes from the founders. But I think I place, like, a lot of value in finding, like, that early team that could kind of help scale. And also scale themselves over the years. So I''ll just say that. That''s super important. Yeah. It is. It''s true. If you have a culture of excellence and execution in crypto, it means the world of difference. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I remember, like, our early team was actually, like, a good mix of actual, like, degens that are in the trenches that are, you know, trading NFTs, tokens, et cetera. Web to, like, ex-product leaders at big tech companies. And some of the best engineers I''ve ever worked with. And, you know, we have that 100x engineer that we thankfully started with. He''s one of the co-founders. And so that mix was actually super important to get off the ground. It''s a mix of, like, understanding go-to-market, understanding business, understanding, like, what the community wants. And obviously being able to execute with the early engineering team. Yeah, definitely. What about you, Justin? Yeah, I think I probably speak from the operator''s standpoint because we''re a layer one blockchain, right? So I think Avalanche came into the space with a very, very clear vision. The future of blockchain will be many blockchains. But what I mean by many blockchains, it''s not going to be a lot of general purpose blockchains. It''s going to be a lot of purpose-built blockchains. Just working backwards, the thought process for this scaling of crypto projects. We need millions of users and thousands of apps. But when you actually toss it in, like, millions of users and thousands, millions of apps just into one chain, it''s going to get clocked up. That''s how blockchain is because you have to communicate with different validators all over the world. It''s really hard to scale technically, right? So the vision of Avalanche is most of these projects will need their own layer one blockchain, basically their own execution environment because corporates, gaming projects, they''re under a lot of compliance and jurisdictional requirements. But they see the value of using a bit of crypto, a bit of blockchain to scale the project. So there''s just one game coming up on Avalanche off the grid. It''s a major AAA gaming. It has 13 million users since November. It''s being operated on PlayStation. It''s the first game to be operating on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. And it''s printing more than 4 million transactions a day. And last year, I think one of the days, one of the lowest days for Ethereum''s transaction was like 80K, 0.8 million, right? So if you need to be a really, really scaling project, you''ll probably need your own execution environment. So that''s the vision of Avalanche. And we actually have a really easy platform to just deploy your own L1s. So that''s where we''re going at. Yeah. That, I would love to stay on the tech stack question for a second. Because obviously, you know, there''s a lot of layer one blockchains and crypto. There''s a lot of block space, if you will. Yes. All discussion around how do they scale. And also, if they do all scale and reach a level of scale, we all imagine, I think, a world where they will interoperate with each other. Whether that''s cross-chain bridges or some sort of interoperable tech. But if everything sort of reaches the scale that we all imagine and that we''re starting to see in some cases on the gaming side or on the deep end side, what does that world look like? You know, if Magic Eden scales and Avalanche scales, I imagine they''ll interact with each other. Either of you, where do you think of scale when it comes to sort of like interoperability? Yeah, I''ll probably start with, I''ll just add on to the gaming space, right? So there''s off-the-grid game. And at the same time, we also have this other major gaming IP coming out of Korea, which is MapleStory Universe. It''s a game that''s been here for 20 years with 250 million users over 20 years. So when there are two gamings operating on their own chains, you definitely need these two games to exchange ideas, exchange assets, exchange messages, right? So the architecture of Avalanche is basically you can deploy L1s whenever you want, and there''s already a native sort of bridge and interchain messaging. So when you have a skin in this one game, and you''ll be awarded, I don''t know, tokens or games, that''s already built in as a very crucial part of Avalanche. So, I mean, I think we are ready in terms of the technicality here. Yeah. Yeah. And from the perspective of a dApp that''s grown over the years into supporting many different chains, I think what I''ll say is, like, what we care about a lot is building that relationship with the user, because we''re a dApp, and we build UI and fun things for users. And we want to have that relationship. So that''s our focus. And I think in scaling over the years and thinking about infrastructure, what I''ll say is we actually don''t want to spend that much time thinking about infra and scaling. And therefore, what we look to do, like, going forward is actually looking at partners that have very scalable infrastructure, like L2s of the world that you could very easily build on top of. And nowadays, it''s actually a lot easier than it used to be, because when we started, we built a stack from the ground up on Solana, then we expanded on to Bitcoin, and building on Bitcoin is pretty jank, I''ll just say it. It''s pretty hard. So, like, looking forward, I actually think a lot of the content will come from the EVM ecosystem, just given how quickly you could spin up an app chain, how quickly you could have content be on chain. And, yeah, that''s sort of, like, where I see the future going. And, obviously, that''s projects like Avalanche. Yeah. I want to move. So, we''ve talked about tech scale. The unavoidable other part of the curtain, if you will, is the token question. And I know there''s lots of projects here today that are thinking about launching a token that have a token. It''s sort of the oxygen in the room in crypto that keeps your project going. In a lot of ways, launching the token is your product launch. In a lot of ways, your first product launch, because it''s done before you launch your tech. So, it''s what your consumer first interacts with. Both of you have, your projects have tokens. Magic Eden were recently. Just some thoughts about how to navigate that. There''s the marketing side of it. There''s the capital market side of it, of good liquidity and listings and discoverability and all of it. Like, how do you approach tokens as part of the scale and ongoing scale and longevity of your project? Excellent question. Because I think there''s, like, you see two examples here. And, like, both of us, from our project perspective, we didn''t choose the same path. An L1 and L2 infrastructure companies, they have a very different goal with the token. And as do dApps. I think it''s very different goals. So, for us, we started out, you know, three years ago as a small salon of marketplace. And we were lucky to find product market fit. And we had some success in gaining users. And not all projects are, like, really privileged in having that. And we actually thought about when is the right time to launch a token, like, over the years. And ultimately, we chose to just double down on building the business and building a better user trap. And so, that''s, you know, that''s culminated over the years in expanding to different chains, launching a wallet. And now there''s, you know, millions of users that use the marketplace across different chains. And thankfully, like, we had the privilege of being able to wait. But the token was a very important part of the equation. And the way we thought about it was, like, we''ll launch it when we''re ready to take the company to the next level. Is sort of how we thought about it. And when we could have that incentive lever to power products. And so, that''s how we thought about it. And that''s what we did. When we went to market with our new wallet, we made the claim of the token exclusively available only in the wallet. And it drove a lot of users to the wallet. And people started using the wallet more. And actually, it was a great success because now there''s, like, 100,000 users in the wallet. Which we wouldn''t have had if, you know, we didn''t actually force them to download it. Which is good. It''s, like, a good way to, like, direct people to different places. Now that we have a scaled user base. But, yeah, we chose to wait. Thankfully, we had some product market fit. Right. And I think that''s one of the key sort of questions. You have to, like, understand. Do you have a big enough user base to sort of, like, power your business for the next few years? And if so, I would say double down on that. And then think about the token afterwards. But it does, as a crypto company, they do play important roles. So, like, you always have to keep it in the back of your head. Yeah, definitely. It''s interesting because both of you come from sort of different perspectives of the token side. You know, you had a product. Because of where you sit on the stack for Magic Eden, you had a product. You had users. You had interactions before the token. But obviously, the nature of a layer one blockchain, you need the token to launch for mainnet to function for people to use your blockchain. So, how do you see tokens as part of scale? I''m actually, like, Avalanche is layer one blockchain. So, the token had to be there on the first day. Sure. Because it''s a guest token of the network. But looking at more, like, crypto projects launching on this network, different networks, I think it''s better to actually show conviction and earn conviction with the actual users during the early phase. Like, there are gamings with beta play that''s inviting a lot of users. And they actually see the value of this project, right? Magic Eden proved to a global audience that this is going to be the leading marketplace for, you know, a different flavor of NFTs, right? So, I think it''s important and better. So, like, if you''re really confident about your project, I think it''s better to launch tokens later compared to, like, what we did at Avalanche with layer one, right? Yeah. Yeah. Just to say on this topic a little more, because I know it''s top of mind for a lot of people at the moment, you know, launching the token is just one step of it. Then you are now forever in crypto, essentially a publicly listed company with a token and a share price. You''re on the foundation side now. And obviously, Avalabs is funded in a lot of ways by the foundation to support the development on the network and support dApps being built on top of Avalanche. How do you think about the foundation and as part of sort of, like, the forever journey of keeping your project alive, being able to fund development and scale in the future as sort of, like, an engine to scale for your projects? Yeah. I could go first. It''s exactly what you said, actually. It''s that engine that could fund a lot of new user experiences in the future. And that''s how we thought about it. But also, like, how we think about the token is almost like, hey, we want people in the ecosystem that like to use the Magic Eden apps. I''ll say, like, the apps ecosystem to actually have ownership and a stake in what''s being built. So an important part of this was launching governance for it. Yeah. And we wanted to make sure that our biggest believers actually have the biggest say in how it develops over the future. It''s, like, one of the key tenants of Web3, right? Allowing. It''s like the alignment. Exactly. Exactly. And so what we did is we basically gave people a staking system. And if, you know, you stake for, we gave them essentially like a way to choose how long they stake. And people just, some people like that are big believers just said, I''m staking my thing for four years. I don''t care. And, you know, when you move that little cursor over in the staking UI, you''re also moving your voting power over. So we''re essentially like aligning your incentives and we''re aligning the true believers to be also the people with the most voice in the ecosystem and ability to shape the protocols and the direction. And then also what you have there is like a way, like a, you know, a true 1,000 believers, let''s call it, like the true 1,000 fans. And that user group, you could reward over time. You could, like, take them in closer to the labs and company and, you know, bring them into the fold of development and get their feedback. And it''s actually like a really good flywheel and good tool to have the community have more participation in the ecosystem. Yeah, definitely. What about you, Justin? Yeah, so for Avalanche, we have Avalanche Foundation and there''s Avalanche. So I''m actually part of the Avalanche. And Avalanche is actually the software service company promoting the ecosystem and the business development for Avalanche Foundation. Right. So we have a clear distinction in terms of roles. So the Avalanche Foundation is a nonprofit. At the same time, the people at Avalanche, we bring expertise and we actually bring services. Like deploying L1 takes a lot of resources. So we actually have a business that actually accrues revenue when we actually provide consultation for launching on L1. That includes tokenomics, business development. We make connections to other partners. So we actually provide professional services. So we try to keep the roles of foundation and Avalanche different. But we are aligned because we''re all for, you know, a bigger ecosystem on Avalanche. Great. So we''ve covered the tech stack. We''ve covered the token side, the foundation side. In our last sort of minute, this is obviously the first year consensus is in Asia. Asia, how do you see Asia for the geography question? And obviously, Justin, you''re head of Asia for Avalanche. So maybe you can start us off. Yeah. How do you see Asia as a crucial part of scale for sort of the next group? I think Asia is a leading geography really for the crypto as an industry. Because just looking at the names of partners that we have in Asia, it''s SK, the second largest conglomerate in Korea. The MapleStory, the largest gaming studio, maybe in the whole world. One of the Suntory is a whiskey brand out of Japan coming into Avalanche, bringing their products. So what we''re seeing here is that financial institutions and corporates are curious and interested in experimenting crypto and blockchain technologies to improve their business, which we really don''t have a lot in the U.S. So I think Asia, looking at these partnerships, is definitely leading and contributing to the industry as a whole. Fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. Big plus one. Maybe people don''t know, but Magicine is a really well-known brand in Western markets and English-speaking markets. But we also have a pretty big brand in places like Korea. Yep. 60% of the trading of our token actually happens in Korea. 60%? Yeah, it''s pretty insane. 60% on Upbit only. And then you add the other exchanges, it''s actually more. And we managed to do that by building on-the-ground community in these markets. And I''d say going forward, our focus will be Asia, for sure, 100%. Because, one, we''re underpenetrated. Right. And, two, I think our products and the things that we build actually resonate a lot with folks. And we''re starting with Korea as the first focused market that we''ll expand to in a big way. And then we''re going to go to Southeast Asia and all the other markets as well. Great to hear, Matt. Well, that''s fantastic, guys. Thank you for your time. And thank you all for coming. And everyone will be probably just outside in the back after the panel if you want to ask them questions. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks.

Welcome to Consensus Money Reimagined Stage. John Pensuller with CoinEd, ManagingEd. And we''ve got a superb group of people here really representing the whole world of crypto. And we''re going to be talking about emerging markets and really how emerging markets can take to crypto, can use crypto to fill in gaps with existing traditional finance and the weaknesses of some of those systems. So I''ll introduce the panelists here. We have Trung here. We have Maggie. We have Chris. And we have Mosh. So I''m going to let them explain a little bit about their background and their company. And then we''ll get into some questions. So Trung, you want to start off? Hello, everyone. Can you hear me? Okay. I can hear you. Thanks, Benjamin and Consensus for the invite. So basically, I''m probably from Vietnam. And hostation is we doing, I''m doing the crypto business for around like seven years. We do mostly like OTC trading. And hostation was like three years old right now. And it''s a wallet. You can, it''s non-custodial. But you can do a lot of things on, you know, OTC directly in the wallet. Maggie. My name is Maggie. And I''m the CEO and co-founder of 2Bit. And I started the crypto journey about eight years ago. And the first thing I do is I start a venture capital. It''s called Crypto Group. And we started to do a lot of primary market investment, second market trading. And then since 2020, and as a chance for me to travel in Latam. And then all of a sudden, like I started a business in Latam. And now we''ve been there for five years. So build a platform, the crypto platform over there. Mainly focusing on crypto trading and also crypto payment. Thank you. Chris? Yeah. Hey, everybody. I''m Chris Maurice, CEO of Yellowcard. We are the largest licensed stablecoin payments orchestrator for Africa and the broader emerging world. I grew up in the U.S. Before this, I was selling Pokemon cards on the Internet when I caught the crypto bug. Good practice. And then I met a Nigerian guy on the Internet that told me to move there, which I did, obviously. And, yeah, started the company. Today we work with businesses, banks, financial institutions of all shapes and sizes. Helping them make international payments, manage treasury, and, you know, really just access dollars using stablecoins. Moshe? Hi, Moshe Schlosser, chairman of Ubit. At Ubit, we started in 2017 focused on creating infrastructure to enable payments using crypto. Our concept is to be an open ecosystem, allowing any wallet to connect to us and for people to be able to use their crypto in the real world. So, Moshe, I was just wondering if we could start with you. You were just in El Salvador, which is kind of a very interesting test market for crypto. Obviously, they went on the Bitcoin standard a few years ago, and now Tether has gone there. It''s going to be headquartered there. What did you learn there about the adoption of crypto in an emerging market? Sure. So, it seems, you know, El Salvador is a fantastic use case to show about financial inclusion and enabling people to kind of leapfrog from, like, a very primitive structure to the most cutting edge, you know, crypto payments. I think every business is mandatory to accept Bitcoin there. But we think overall, more and more people were going to move to stablecoins, to being able to pay through their wallet directly in merchants. And it''s been a phenomenal experience over there to see what''s going on. Chris, so Africa probably least advanced in terms of kind of traditional financial infrastructure. Give us some examples of how crypto has helped some of those markets to evolve. Yeah, I think, you know, look, you don''t need traditional financial infrastructure anymore, which is, you know, the beauty of this space, right? You know, the customers that we work with, right, the businesses, the banks, the financial institutions, the importers, exporters, etc., that we work with across the continent. And, you know, the majority of them have one main thing in common, which is that they don''t really care about stablecoins. They don''t care about blockchain. They don''t really care about any of the stuff that we''re talking about here. They care about solving their problem. And, you know, that is, I think, you know, really the power of this technology and, you know, the power of stablecoins more broadly is it enables businesses around the world, in parts of the world, where you don''t have access to USD. In parts of the world where banks cannot facilitate international payments at, you know, any sort of scale that''s necessary to be able to continue operations. It enables them to take back control of their own money. It enables them to be able to actually, you know, facilitate these payments themselves. And, yeah, it''s, you know, I think that''s probably the, you know, the most powerful thing about it. But I think, you know, we spend a lot of time on education and trying to make sure that everybody understands, you know, the technology and self-custody and things like that. And realistically, a lot of these guys don''t care. They''re interested in solving their problems. They''re interested in making payments. And so, yeah, that''s, you know, I mean, that''s what we focus on. It''s just a very practical use case for the space, for the technology to enable businesses to be able to continue to operate in markets they otherwise wouldn''t be able to. So, Maggie, just take on that question as well. I mean, on the one hand, you have a technology that''s tremendously useful that can fill in a gap. But it does have this reputation for complexity and difficult to use. How are you working to abstract some of that complexity to make it easier for people? Yeah, I think one very important thing that we''re also Chris mentioning about, a lot of businesses really don''t care about the stablecoin blockchain. They don''t know anything about that. And we''re not into educating them either. So we try to innovate and build a product that which is very easier for them to use and without any, like, hassles. So, for example, like our product, and when users are logging, it''s a very simple interface for them. They don''t even know you''re using stablecoin or blockchain behind the scene. But actually, you''re solving their problem and pain points. So I think product-wise, it''s very important to build something that you can serve to provide a very seamless user experience compared to traditional financial or decentralized platform. Because they don''t have to remember the private key and all the complicated stuff. Right. Sure. I think, like, for me, it''s similar, like, for Vietnam market. It''s what Chris has been saying. People don''t really care about, you know, like, how to actually, like, what is crypto, what is blockchain is about. They care more about the payments. And for the Vietnam market, the reason that the people involved in the industry is mostly on a few categories. First one, investment, of course. But the second one can be, like, the devaluations of the currencies in Vietnam. And people want to hedge that with, like, USD or USDT. But buying USD in Vietnam is pretty hard. You need a lot of compliance and control. So that''s why, you know, like, the OTC, the payment stuff like this appear for them to hedging their position. And overall, like, in the remittance services, they start using that as well. In Vietnam, also this year, the regulations stand out pretty clear. That''s a lot of things changing and very positive for the Vietnam market in this area. Okay. What about the impact of regulation? Do you feel that it''s getting easier now in the markets that you represent to do business? And how is maybe the impact of the U.S. market with the kind of liberalization with the Trump administration? How is that going to change in the conversation about regulation where you are? Marsh? It certainly seems that the regulatory environment is getting better, obviously, under Trump. Some of the markets that we operate in a lot of time, like Mexico, there''s an interesting use case where a lot of Mexican employees go and work in the U.S. And they send back about $100 billion to Mexico every year, which is very costly and with a lot of friction. You know, they use the typical old school Western Union that charges them 8% to 10%. And then $100 billion, that''s a lot and takes a while. So, you know, we think, you know, in the markets that we operate in, given the, you know, especially for stable coins, the regulatory that we''re going to see through the U.S. will enable a much more seamless path to be able to do global remittance, making more instant and cheaper. You know, and in a market that''s $100 billion that moves from the U.S. to Mexico, changing it from $10 billion being charged to $1 billion is still profitable enough to make sense, but at the same time make it 90% cheaper, make it much more accessible, frictionless. And I think with regulations, it''s going to be much more easier to be done. So if I''m a Mexican living in the U.S. and I''m sending money back to Mexico, it''s now 1% versus 8% with Western Union? It would probably be between, typically it would be between 8% to 12% in a while, and then it goes door to door from, you know, where you are in the U.S. to the Mexican peso to your family. To be able to enable that instantly, almost instantly, and at 90% cheaper, 1%, that''s where we are, and that''s where we think there''s a huge opportunity. And there are similar markets to that, you know, like the Philippines and others that just send a lot of people abroad and they''re sending back money. And it''s just costing them an arm and a leg, and we think that could be a huge disruption. And it''s not just like an edge case. These are huge markets. It''s $100 billion a year. So I think with the right regulation around stablecoins, it will be much easier to on-ramp and off-ramp. And with our infrastructure, it could be enabled in a big way. Right. Chris, were you going to say something? No. Okay. I can. No, no, I look like you were about to say something. That''s why I asked. Maggie, I mean, you were talking about, you deal with the Latin markets as well, and you were talking earlier about how a lot of Chinese companies are using Mexico as a kind of staging post to get into the U.S. market, and then now wanting to transfer using stablecoins, the kind of B2B payments. Just talk about that and how they can use TrueBet to do that. Yeah. I think Mexico has a very special location between the U.S. and China, and now the new shoring becomes a big trend out there. There''s a lot of Asian companies, very Chinese companies. They''re moving their manufacture to Mexico and building manufacturing and producing a product over there, and then they will ship the product to the U.S. and that actually increasing a lot of trading value between Asia and Latam. I think yearly-wise is around $480 billion of transactions, and traditionally they only can use bank rails. You have to go through Swift and have to wait five to seven days and with at least two or three percent of the FX rail you have to pay. But now by using the stablecoin and by using our solution, you can receive your funds or payout, massive payout within a day. So it''s T-plus zero, it''s blockchain. Also connecting with the bank APIs, you can get your fiat within 30 minutes. You will imagine how amazing it''s there. And also you can control very low rates, as well as 90% probably less than the traditional way. And Chris, I mean, are you mainly transacting using stablecoins, and would those mostly be USDC and USDT? Yes. Yeah, USDC, USDT, PYUSD, if you''re feeling adventurous. You know, I think, you know, to your original question, though, the regulation, when you look broadly across the African continent, has gotten, I mean, there was just a massive sea change that we saw about two and a half years ago. And, you know, the regulation writ large has improved pretty significantly since then, where it was, I would say, gray slash hostile before that. And, you know, obviously things have changed a lot in the U.S. now since, you know, in the past couple of months, right? But, you know, pre-November, the African continent was the single best place to start a company in stablecoins, in crypto more broadly. You had the most access... Anywhere in the world? Anywhere in the world. You had the most access to regulators. You had the most sort of, you know, clarity in key markets. You have, you know, a number of sandboxes available. You have, you know, in general, you have regulators that are looking for innovation to spring up locally, as opposed to being developed somewhere else and then being imported at great expense. And, you know, I think this trend has been going on. And now with, you know, everything going on in the U.S. and sort of the Trump effect, it''s only compounding. I had a regulator ask recently why Trump gets so much credit for embracing Bitcoin when it was actually President Tenubu of Nigeria who was the first one to say that he liked Bitcoin. So, you know, people have really taken notice and there''s sort of a, you know, a race going on now within the continent to get some of this legislation through. And you''re starting to see this in Kenya, Morocco, and a number of other markets where they''re racing to get through legislation to encourage these companies to start there, to move there, to grow there, to hire there, and, you know, develop locally within, you know, each particular country. Do you think that Trump gets too much credit for liberalizing crypto? Hey, it should go to Tenubu, apparently. It should. What do you think, Trump? Yeah, for me, like, on the perspective of Vietnam, it''s probably the combination of Mosh, Chris, and Maggie together. Especially, like, right now in Vietnam, if you want to send the money out, you have to, at least, you have to pay around, like, 3% on the Forex rate, additional 2% for the transactions we''ve got the banks, so total around, like, 5% plus. And a lot of paperwork as well. So with the growth of, like, Tether, USAT, across the whole world, and also, like, the position of Vietnam, very nature between, like, China and US, we are in a very good position. There''s a lot of good trades there, so the exposure is very large. Also, like, under the new regimes of the prime ministers of Vietnam, the innovation is the key for the growth, and by this year, regulation of crypto is going to come out, and also what Chris said about, like, sandbox, and all of the innovation in this area will be available in Vietnam this year as well. I mean, what particular are they doing in terms of regulation? So the regulation, they got the overall, like, crypto framework, and in the future, like, they legalize a stable point, and another few other steps to be the local exchange. Yeah. Okay. I''m interested in this role of USDT, Tether, because a lot of people think that the new stablecoin legislation in the US is going to make USDC more usable, more palatable than USDT is. I mean, are we going to see this kind of bifurcation between, you know, USDT for emerging markets and USDC for other types of markets? Is that what we think? That''s exactly the same. What you have said is actually correct. In Asia right now, people tend to use, like, USDT more as the method of transaction using join network as part of that, and in the US, it''s more like USDC or, you know, Europe. So to, if, like, the transaction make, they have, like, at least, like, the liquidities in the middle to transact, we cannot, like, change the habit of the Asia, you know, like, to move 100% going over to USDC or changing, you know, like, the US to using the USDT. So we are just in the middle and make sure that, okay, liquidity on both sides is good. And whatever the client needs, we also provide that. Okay. Mosh, I''m interested. I mean, you have a kind of global view of things. Are there any places in the world that we maybe don''t know about that are enthusiastic kind of users of crypto for the types of use cases that we''re talking about? I think it''s obviously still an education phase for a lot of people around the world, especially in the places that need it most, which is, like, the cash economies that you see in Africa and in Latin America and places in Southeast Asia. I think one of the, you know, to touch on the question you asked before about Tether, one of the things that they''ve been doing is kind of creating these endpoints and touchpoints in these areas of the world that are very cash-intensive and kind of bringing them back into the digital economy and enabling them to use it worldwide or locally through the traditional rails. So it''s not just, like, it''s very easy to compete on, like, a stable coin. You can build a stable coin in a second, but having the infrastructure in place across the globe to enable the on-ramp and off-ramp, that''s really where it becomes competitive and interesting. And I think one of the things that Tether has been doing is building out that infrastructure to enable that on-ramp and off-ramp, which I think, you know, USDC is lagging behind. Of course, in the U.S., you already have regular payment infrastructure. It''s not really needed as much. So they might be the biggest in the U.S., but it''s, like, who''s using crypto in the U.S.? Right? You want to use stable coins in places that are actually needed. And worldwide and emerging markets, the main focus of Tether was to build out that infrastructure. I''m not a spokesman of Tether, but they are our partners, so... All right. Maggie, what do you think? So we leave this to the clients. So we do have two types of clients. So one type of client, they want the flexibilities. They love Tether. They use USDT. But there''s another client. They''re an institution client. They have internal compliance requirements. So they will, you know, point out, and I have to use USDC. And it really depends what kind of the client they are. For us, you know, we use anything that they want, but we provide different liquidity for them. So we also partner with a circle. We also partner with a tether. Right. So... Do we think that stable coins will basically be USD denominated in the future, or will other currencies come and be stable coins as well? It''s USD. USD. Like, for any, like, real market cap, it''s going to be USD. Nobody wants anything else. We''ve never gotten a single request for euro or anything like that, right? So everybody everywhere in the world wants the dollar. That''s the reality. And I think that, you know, stable coins for anything other than the dollar, unless you have banks really utilizing them for settlement, right? And you have, you know, like banks being able to settle amongst themselves in stable coins, unless you have some sort of, you know, mass adoption platform within a country, right, to encourage the use of a stable coin on any other currency. I just, I don''t see it happening. Yeah, I think, you know, the dollar is what everybody everywhere in the world is looking for. Local currencies, I mean, it depends on the country, obviously, but at least, you know, for a lot of the markets that we work in typically settle faster on local rails than sending a stable coin and then having to liquidate that to local rails and then send that payment anyways. So I think, you know, there''s a reason that nobody''s using euro stable coins. Should we take some questions from the audience? Anyone? Where''s the microphone? Please, gentleman over here. Can you hear me? Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. I was curious, how do you view DPEG risk? Is that something that you actively try and mitigate and talk to your customers, clients about and educate them on? Or is it something you just say, ah, the base unit of account is a stable coin and that''s that? DPEgging anyone? I mean, we don''t, we sit in stable coins for, I mean, you know, seconds, right? A customer is sitting in stable coins for a couple of minutes. You know, again, I mean, we''re using these for transactions, right? We''re not using this for, you know, the vast majority of companies that we''re working with are not using this for savings. They''re not using it for, you know, really for storing value or anything like that. They''re using it for facilitating payments, right? So, you know, I have money in, you know, country A, I need to get it to country B. How do I, you know, facilitate that transaction in the quickest, smoothest way? So I think the, you know, the DPEG risk is pretty minimal, right? In terms of, you know, is the currency going to blow up in the next five minutes? You know, probably not, right? Yeah. And so I don''t see it as a massive risk. I don''t think, you know, most of the customers that we work with see it as a massive risk because it''s just such a short timeframe. Anyone else think about exchange risk? I think, I think the major stablecoins have done a pretty good job being transparent about what they''re doing with the USD, specifically Tether, around T-bills, which the majority is sitting in T-bills. So unless you think the U.S. is going to default, which is a possibility, but not a big one. The vast majority is there and their balance sheet and so on. And I think that''s one of the big moats that some of the bigger players have now, that they have also a huge balance sheet besides what they''re doing with T-bills. So we don''t see it as a major risk. But like Chris said, for us, as an infrastructure layer, we just do transactions so we don''t take major risk on the stablecoin itself. But we''re quite comfortable with specifically USDT. Yeah, if the U.S. defaults, we have a lot bigger problems than, you know, what''s going on with our stablecoins. I think, I just want to give an example in Argentina. So in Argentina, they have, you know, a lot of inflation out there. So for the people living there, holding their own currency, it''s a risk. So they want to sell their own currency to USD, but they have no way to do it because the bank doesn''t provide any USD bank accounts. And stablecoin becomes the only solution for the, in the quick way to hold some sort of USD. So for them, if you''re providing a platform, a solution for them to buy the USDT with this immediately, is it really helping them? And then, once, there might be a risk on the sell side, but for a company like us, we already have very mature trading desk, hedging department, risk control. We have all kinds of the, the, the info to support, to liquid out, and to hedging our position, to making sure that we''re profitable, you know, from what we''re selling. I suppose in Argentina, it''s more dangerous to hold meme coins than USD. Anyone else question here? So, companies are still launching new US dollar stablecoin, even though there are two big giants in the market right now. are there any aspects of these new US dollar stablecoin you see that could bridge any current gaps or current deficiencies in the two big giants that would make it a third or actual sizable coin? Maybe yield bearing stablecoins? Anyone? I think this is a very good question. You know, for last year, there''s over 10 different USD, 10 different kind of the USD stablecoin come to Mexico and one willing to partnering with us. But unfortunately, like, it''s really hard to be honest, at least at this moment, unless you are PayPal, right? PayPal have their PayPal USD. And if you go to the marketplace, you''re checking on the daily transaction value between the different type of stablecoin. And then you will see USD and USD still will be dominated. And USD is still much larger than USD, in fact. And the rest of the stablecoin will be much, much smaller. And I know there''s a lot of the new type of the USD pack, the stablecoin. But I want to see there''s a huge challenge in front of them. Because you need a lot of money to back you and to provide the liquidity in each of the country. And because we need a very fast settlement. And other than that, I think that''s the challenge in front of Paxo and Gemini. And all those big name, most stablecoin, they have less value, I think, than us. And we have a real use case. But we don''t, at least us, we don''t insuring any USD stablecoin. but one day, for example, a company like us, if we have huge value to moving between different countries, we can, we can use our stablecoin. For example, there''s a company in the U.S. called Bridge, just acquiring ViceDrive. They newly launched a stablecoin. And they will provide you on top of that. I think that''s a good use case that might have some opportunities for new USD stablecoins. Yeah, I''ll be a little bit more controversial. So, I will preface this by saying that obviously USDT and USDC are the most liquid stablecoins today. However, I think that they are the worst positioned in the market right now. I think that PYUSD and RLUSD, Ripple, and PayPal are actually the best positioned stablecoins right now for the market moving forward. And the reason that I say that is this entire market is going to change in the next 12 to 18 months. USDT and USDC only make money one way, which is you hold the token and they get to put the money in treasuries and then they keep the yield. And you have several A lot of yield. Yeah, look, I mean, Tether is like the most profitable company in the history of capitalism per employee, right? So, yeah, they''ve done very well. This is not to say that these companies have not done well. I just think that when you look over the next 12 to 18 months, you have several factors working against that business model, right? You have Trump in the White House who is promising to bring interest rates down. you have increased competition from yield-bearing stable coins, right? You know, the Paxos and mountains and others in the world. And, you know, you have this overall movement right now in stable coins to give more and more of that yield back to the consumer, right? You already see this on, like, Coinbase. Like, I have USDC on Coinbase. Coinbase gives me 4.7%, right? So, essentially, the entire yield that they''re earning is already going back to the consumer. And you''re going to start to see more and more of that as USDT and USDC try to keep up with, you know, yield-bearing stable coins and things like that. The thing is, is these guys have no other way of making money right now. USDT and USDC have not invested in the on- and off-ramp infrastructure outside of US dollars that I think is important for them as stable coins, to really look into and really get into. The future of stable coins is on payments. And, you know, the reality is you can make a lot more money on payments than you can sitting in treasuries, right? Right now, Tether makes, you know, what, 5% a year on a dollar. You can make 5% a week on payments. You can make, you know, 1% a day, 50 bips a day, and you can cycle that money as many times as, you know, people need the payments, right? As opposed to being able to cycle that and make that revenue once a year. And so, you know, I think that when you look at stable coins that are being issued by companies that actually have payment networks, right? PayPal, Ripple, et cetera. And, you know, look, a lot of it depends on their execution. Are these guys going to be able to integrate the stable coin into their existing payment networks fast enough for, you know, this to matter before, you know, companies like Visa and MasterCard and banks, you know, get into the space, which they will, and they will all issue their own stable coin eventually. That''s the big question. But I think that, you know, the companies with existing payment networks that have alternative ways of being able to drive revenue and, like, earn money off of their stable coins will be in a much better place in 12 to 18 months when these issuers are fighting over 25 to 50 bips instead of fighting over, you know, 400 bips right now. Next question. Hi there. Do you see a future where people opt to hold their assets more in stable coins? Now, given what you''ve said about the yields, the possible yields in stable coins, do you see a future where instead of using it as an intermediary from one fiat to another, and people choose to hold their liquidity in stable coins for yield? Yes, if they have a reason to. And again, like, my core problem today with USDT and USDC is there''s not really, outside of being a company with, like, a US bank account, there''s not really a good reason to hold these tokens, right? Because what can I do with USDC today? I can give that back to... account, you know, in the US, in my name. So if I''m a company anywhere else in the world that can''t get a US bank account, that cannot get, you know, local, onshore, you know, rails in Europe, US, and other markets, which most companies can''t, right? You look across, you know, Africa, Southeast Asia, Latin America, right? Most companies operating in these parts of the world can''t just get a US or European bank account in their name that enables them to smoothly interface with something like USDC. There''s no reason to really hold it in that case, right? Unless you have alternative on and off ramps. And so, you know, I think that in order for people to really want to sit in stable coins and for, you know, the AUM to go up, you need to essentially provide people a US dollar banking alternative on stable coins, right? I need to be able to hold USDT or USDC and then make a payment, make a dollar payment to China, to India, to Europe, make a Naira payment, a Euro payment, et cetera, from some sort of base. But, you know, until then, I just, I don''t see people necessarily holding stable coins for, you know, long periods of time on chain unless there''s, you know, more on and off ramps available to do something with it. Another question? I have a question. Is there any run about no US dollar stable coins such as Hong Kong stable coins? Sorry, can you repeat the question? Could you repeat the question? Sorry, I didn''t hear it. Is there any run about non-US dollar stable coins such as Hong Kong stable coins? He''s asking about non-US dollar stable coins. In Hong Kong, yeah. I think Chris just mentioned a little bit, you know, now still USD dollar stable coins will be dominated. But, for example, like, we''re in Mexico, we''re issuing a Mexico stable coin. So, we have our own pesos-packed stable coin. Right. But it''s not a lot of value, to be honest. This is kind of intermediary for us because every single user, when they''re on board, they have to use our stable coin. And then, immediately, they will change to, like, USD. Right. And they will use USD across the country, globally. So, value-wise, at least for our case, local generate stable coins still are quite small. Yeah. I''m not sure you guys have any. I think we''ve got time for one more question. If you want. Right here. Right there. Can we? First of all, thank you for all the insights you shared with us today. Yes, thank you for the insights. Yeah. So, thank you so much. That''s the first thing. And my question is about what are the challenges, like, the biggest challenges you are facing when you are collaborating with highly regulated financial institutions? Yeah. I think a regulation is one of biggest challenges. Yeah. I think the regulation framework is the key. And when it''s green lines from the top regulation, then you can and then the financial institution is willing to adapt new technology, then they will potentially, like, moving toward these new stable coins. Otherwise, it''s very, very hard. Yeah. I think today the world, especially when we are, like, 2025, compared to 2020, when I first land in Mexico, the regulators are much more open-minded and you have much more legal framework to follow. And, for example, like, we years before, Argentina doesn''t have any license related to crypto. and after the new president be elected and they''re launching a new license, which we already obtained. So, I think it''s getting more, like, friendly for our industry. And it''s a good thing. But I think they still have a lot things that we need to do. It''s a long way to go. And there are a lot more countries need to launch their new regulation framework for our industry. And that''s still a challenge, I think. Yeah. Great. Well, that''s all the time we have. Thanks very much for coming. And thank you to Marsh. Thank you to Chris. Thank you to Maggie. And thank you to Trump for all your insights. Thank you. Pleasure. I appreciate it. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('d3741435f0', 'Zeebu Mainstage Session - Bridging Reality and Blockchain: The Future of RWAs & User Abstraction', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', 'Ben Shiller, Managing Editor at Coindesk Hi everybody, I''m Ben Shiller, Managing Editor at Coindesk and we''ve got a special session here sponsored by Zebu, which is the sponsor also of the main stage here. So thanks all for coming. I''ve got Raj Bambarat here and then we''ve got James Harris from Zodio Custody. And then we''ve got 0xSocratic here on the far corner there and he''s from Dab Dab. So I''ll let them just explain what they''re doing and we''re going to hear from Raj in a minute. So what is Zebu exactly? You''re a bulk telecoms payments provider. Just explain what you''re doing a little bit. So Zebu at the high level is effectively a mission to get crypto and blockchain technology to the next 1, 2, 3 billion users. And we saw an opportunity to do so specifically through the telecom industry, both at the wholesale level and the retail level. Wherein we are working to integrate vertically directly to the cell phone service subscribers all over the world to enable blockchain wallets for them, crypto collateralized credit cards, etc. And then at the wholesale level, we are currently enabling 140 institutional telecom clients to settle value. So payments cross borders instantaneously and at a very cheap rate. And we have enabled them to do over $6 billion in transactions till date. That''s amazing. And you started only in 2023, right? Yeah. So that''s $6 billion in about 18, 20 months. That''s the power of crypto. So James, Zodiac, what do you do? First of all, thank you very much for inviting me on this Zebu stage. So thanks, Raj. Lovely to be here today. James Harris, Chief Commercial Officer at Zodiac Custody. We are a regulated digital asset custodian based in UK, Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Japan. So pretty much global. And we''re also owned by a consortium of banks, including Standard Chartered, SBI and Northern Trust. So we''ve got two verticals. The first one is we look after people''s balances. And the second one is we also provide technology to banks and financial institutions so that they themselves can be digital asset custodians. And we do that predominantly with Standard Chartered, who recently announced an offering. Okay. ZeroX, Socratic, DabDab, tell us about that. Cool. Yeah. First of all, thank you for inviting us. So basically, DabDab is a consumer app that aims to address the UX fragmentation in the market today. So TLDR on the numbers, basically there''s about like 5,000 to 6,000 DeFi application recorded on DeFi Llama these days. And there''s about like hundreds of the layer 2s, layer 1s. To the end users, like they will feel fragmented when they access the different apps across different chains. Seeing like changing different websites, switching between different wallets. So DabDab is basically a consumer app that aims to address the UX fragmentation. And basically we have integrated about 200 different DeFi applications across 20 different chains. And basically users can come to a single platform, they can interact with all of the applications on a single platform. And yeah, well today we served around 12 million users to date. So that number is still growing. Great. So what three of you have in common is you''re all doing abstraction or reducing complexity for mainstream companies to get involved with crypto. So just talk about that theme within your business. How are you doing that for the telecom clients? Well, I think kind of to add on to zero access point, fragmentation of services is like a massive issue within Web3. When whether you''re a retail user or an institutional user, you need to be fragmented. You know, you need to go to multiple services into in order to achieve one single thing. Right? Usually it''s like I''ll on ramp from fiat to crypto from one venue. I''ll be custodying my assets in another one. I''ll be verifying transactions in another venue, such as, you know, a scanner, et cetera. And for most people that aren''t necessarily Web3 native, and nor are they highly incentivized to become Web3 native, this is a pretty high barrier to entry. So with Zebu, what we did specifically for institutions was we added a bunch of value added services into one specific platform. We enabled fiat on ramp off ramp, KYC, KYB, KYT, custodial, non-custodial services, et cetera, along with invoicing all in one platform. Wherein their experience as a user doesn''t really change much from what they were already used to, but they still get the end benefits of using blockchain technology. And I think that''s like a pretty core ethos of ours with, you know, as we while we horizontally expanded other industries such as commodities, music, automated payments, and we even are vertically expanding within Teleco, our main focus continues to remain is how do we give the end benefit of blockchain technology to the larger masses of institutional and retail users while, you know, abstracting them away from the complexity of fragmentation and lack of understanding. So you''re reducing the cost of making bulk payments, B2B bulk payments within telecom companies. Yes. So what was the problem they had before that you''re now solving with a stable coin mechanism? So number one, massive delays using traditional bank accounts simply in order to remit value because most wholesale service providers are remitting at a global scale, right? Whenever you''re remitting at a global scale, the fiat is going through multiple institutions usually, you know, anywhere between two to three. And in the process, those institutions have reserve requirements. And as part of the reserve requirements, they will hold your capital for one, two, three days at a time, which could lead to a delay of, you know, up to 14 days in some cases. So the wholesale service providers were losing out on massive opportunity to pre-purchase capacity at a global scale because of those delays. And additionally, specifically for emerging markets where dollar availability is low, they weren''t expensive and expensive. Yeah, exactly. They weren''t able to maximize their potential when it came to margins and, I guess, acquiring business at a global scale. So what we did was we set up pairs at a local level with ZBU and the local currency. And we started sourcing stable coin from a much cheaper avenue. ZBU is your utility token. Yes. ZBU is our utility token. It''s used for remittances, on ramp, in some cases, store value and loyalty and rewards. And that is effectively what enables cheap transactions at a global scale. Right. So James, what does abstraction mean for you? Actually, we share another thing in common. We all work with Waxman, the PR agent. They got us together on the stage today, which is super cool. Thank you, Waxman. I think abstracting away the blockchain for us is not just something we deal with on a day-to-day basis. It''s something that is a core value proposition for us. I mean, our clients are banks, brokers, institutions, fund managers, that kind of thing. And they want exposure to the digital assets without the headaches that come with them. Right. They want to explore the paradigms that are possible in digital assets, but they just don''t want to do the infrastructure work. So I think we help our clients interact with digital assets in a way that feels familiar to them. And that means, one, we need to know what their flows are and how they do things, because we need to match up things that they do. But we don''t want them to be too worried about key management or smart contract security risk and that kind of thing. We abstract that away from them. And so really then it boils down to us providing them with a regulated bank-grade custody service where the assets are held in the same way that they''re already used to, with traditional assets or whatever it is. So there''s a couple of ways that we do that. So our first vertical is that we provide balances and we hold balances and wallets for our clients. And a client shouldn''t really care whether it''s BTC or a tokenized fund. Right. It''s the same. They want to hold the assets. They want to show them on the GUI. They want to be able to know what it''s worth. They want to be able to transact if they need to. That''s it. They don''t need to know the vagaries of what it''s like to interact with the underlying blockchain. And then from a SaaS white label perspective, they just want a technology platform that looks like everything else that they''ve got. Right. So that''s, I think, a key thing that we do. And that''s why banks like Standard Chartered and the SBI group, they all trust us to do that. I always like to joke that custody is actually the most stressful, boring job in the world. And the reason why it''s stressful and boring at the same time. It doesn''t sound like a joke. Well, yeah. It doesn''t feel like a joke, but, you know, welcome to our world. But it''s because just to provide a wallet service that has all of the coins and tokens that it needs to hold, all of the services that are attached to it, you have to integrate with everybody. Right. You have to understand new protocols. Everyone''s got different APIs. You have to take that away. And as a whole, if you look at that, it''s a big exercise in abstraction. So that''s really what we do. We want to see blockchain really as an enabler, not a barrier. Right. So that''s how we look at it. And we like to bring our clients on that journey. It''s a really tough journey. And so if we can impart some of the lessons we''ve learned the hard way so that they don''t have to, they can get on what''s important to them, which is serving their customers and growing their businesses. Great. Zero X Socratic. So I love the name, by the way. Dab Dab. So it''s a DeFi platform that allows people to transact across multiple chains from a single place, right? Yep. Yeah. Basically, abstraction is the core value of what we offer. And abstraction to us is about efficiency. Before we started this application, we''ve done some data studies in the market. We see that, like, on average, there''s about a couple million active users, monthly active users in the market. But each of them will only really have, like, about five to ten minutes a day, interacting with all applications across the market. But it creates, the problem it creates is without a unified platform, without a unified access place, it creates tougher and tougher place market for new startups trying to compete for a portion of the user attention. Right? So, like, abstraction basically for us is a mission to improve the efficiencies of how users can allocate the time such that they can maximize the encounter and DeFi users'' use cases that they can interact on chain. Right? Secondly, it''s about expansion. So, think about, like, average users will only have about five to ten minutes a day. What else, what are the other times they''re allocating on? Maybe on TikTok, maybe on, like, Amazon, maybe on, like, different, like, Alipay or PayPal examples. Right? We are, we need to compete for more user attention from them. Right? So, like, custodian services, also, like, payment services, and also real-world asset services, they need to be combined together. We need to work together to improve, like, on attracting away the user steps and for them to, like, experience as a whole system. So, we, as a whole market, can grow better to compete for more attention from those markets instead of, like, competing with the internal resources. Yes. Awesome. Great. So, we don''t have too long left here. So, you''re going into retail now. You''re not sticking just with institutions. You''re now going B to C as well. Yeah. I think we''ve done pretty well capturing the telco wholesale market already, you know, again, $6 billion in transactions in the past 18 or so months. And we''re well set to increase that number quite a bit exponentially as we bring in more and more liquidity into our liquidity protocol for Zebu. So, now we''re mainly focused on, I guess, three things. Main thing is the Zebu protocol, where we have node operators that effectively act as our network''s consensus mechanisms to verify transactions, source the cheapest possible liquidity, provide abstraction services such as gas abstraction, and then stakes ZBU as economic security, and then also liquidity providers that enable us to provide low-slipish transactions across the board. So, as we bring on those participants, we''re now able to enable more and more industries such as direct retail of cell phone service providers, and also horizontally expand to other institutional providers such as shipping, commodities, automated payments, etc. Okay. So, more participants, more liquidity, more useful service. Yes. And then all of the participants that join us in the Zebu protocol are effectively able to earn a share of our revenues. So, real-world yield paid out in stablecoin. Right. Yeah. All right. Unfortunately, that''s all the time we have for today. Thanks very much. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.e-session-7', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.204', NULL, NULL, '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');

Lack of adoption Here comes Apilang A one-stop shop for builders of the future web Now, without Apilang Developers need to go through lengthy researching of documentation They have to go through configuration And integrate it into the product And they have to manage tokens for underlying payments With Apilang It''s a matter of one API call and it''s done Now, let us step back and see Apilang in the big picture Web1 had cPanel for website hosting Web2 have Firebase for easier development And Web3 has Apilang That is mimicking Web2 development But with all the perks of decentralization And we do that through simple APIs SDKs, pre-built solution And clear documentation We''re also governed by the developers And we do all the payments So that developers don''t need to handle multiple tokens for payment We provide core services Such as decentralized storage Decentralized hosting Decentralized compute Decentralized identity We provide developers with embedded wallets So they can onboard their users faster We provide pre-built solutions And they can deploy smart contracts as well All that through a sleek dashboard With all the analytics they need We''re extremely proud of the numbers We have over 140,000 builders currently registered They created over 100,000 projects Deployed 30,000 NFT collections And so on This shows Apilang is really solving real-world problems To real-world developers We received over 2 million from Polkadot treasury In the past two years Showing that the ecosystem of developers believes This is something they need Furthermore, currently we are enrolled in one of the most premier New York accelerators Helping us get the additional funding as well as enter US market And in the next few weeks Currently we''re only building in Polkadot But we will be adding new support for new blockchains And new ecosystems Creating unprecedented growth opportunities Thank you Maybe you can just explain a little bit on the team background Okay We started in 2021 by five founders We all have pretty lengthy experience in blockchain I''m the COO Our CTO has more than 10 years of experience Building complex products in the blockchain space Our CEO, who is currently in New York In the accelerator Also have over 15 years of experience building blockchain Plus some experience in enterprise such as Commvault And so on Currently there''s 15 people working for Apilang And yeah, as I said We''re working hard to become the next go-to Web3 development platform Yeah I think it is SaaS business model So how many clients you have And what''s the price you charge for them? Yeah So we have different models You can buy credits Or you can have like SaaS Like you said But currently due to our Being funded by the Polkadot treasury Everything is in freemium So adding new ecosystems And adding new chains to the platform Will be the next step towards Paying clients from other ecosystems What''s your pricing plan? We have different pricing from $9.99 to $99.99 per month Depending on the product and support from our team Yeah, and just quickly on the business model for the token itself Why do you need the token? And how does the token accrue value from the platform? So our token is more or less for governance purposes So that developers can guide the platform the way they wish to be done I''m here, Doman Thank you so much Maybe you can continue answering that question later on Apilang We''re down to the last three And next is Oneverse Technology Who will be presenting? Well, it''s Jason Chong He is the product director at Oneverse Technology Please welcome him Hi, everyone Hello, judges Introducing Oneverse Pay 5 The new virtual economy engine That breached traditional games and web 3 So we started off with gaming As it''s a proven industry with high spendings Borderless payments As well as ease of transferable of a digital asset So today, in Oneverse 60% of our gamers are actually transacting with us in USDT With the ever-growing of the gaming industry We are actually introducing Oneverse Pay 5 To serve as a bridge between the traditional gaming and web 3 So today, over the past one year We have achieved 20 million of sales in revenues Whereby 60% of it from USDT And with a market reach of 7 million of communities And we are also connected to more than 100 games As well as 60 payment channels in Southeast Asia and Latin America So here are some of the top games titles that we carry With a global market of the 3 billion And also monthly active gamers of 500 million And we connected to 60 payment channels in the Southeast Asia and Latin America And we actually also do a lot of brand collaboration with the top brands in the Southeast Asia And we further strengthen it with our collaboration with the local speaking influencers Mainly in Southeast Asia as well So over the next three years We are to get ourselves connected to more than 150 games in the regions As well as onboarding 100 million of users to our platform And from there on, we are going to actually convert all these 20 million of mainstream users into Web3 So our token model works based on 1-1 credits The universal currencies within our ecosystems Compliment with governance tokens With a total token supply of 10 billion So just here, just a brief of what we have done over the past one year So we have a market presence in Southeast Asia and Latin America With a local offices in six countries As well as a hit out of 20 million in just a one year of establishments And moving next We are going to actually continue to expand our market presence in different markets And also continue to develop new products As well as achieve 100 million sales of revenues And our core team We are coming with more than 25 years of experience In business and financial planning, payments, as well as compliance Thank you Thank you for your time Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you So you provide a payments, crypto payment solution to let a user can buy game, game asset with fiat or crypto, right? We basically accept both and 60% of it actually is coming from USDT USDT Yes Okay So how do you convert fiat to USDT? The conversion is not done by us But basically our end users, our gamers, they already have the USDT And they just come to our platform to get their purchases with all the different games that they are actually playing But I think the game company, they need fiat, right? Yeah So how do you convert crypto to fiat? Yeah, basically today we are actually paying them in fiat, right? So if you actually want to, basically we have a sufficient cash flow that we can actually pay them in fiat as well Okay Just quickly the revenue numbers that you mentioned, which are quite high, so what''s exactly the source of the revenue? So you take a commission on a... The revenue is actually gross revenue, but in our commissions we do have a profit sharing in terms of when we are actually selling on behalf of... or we are actually reaching for the game publishers to all these audience in the market Yeah, and just going back to the token again, so can you explain once again what''s the utility for the token? And why do you need it? Yeah, basically I think today all these are our users, they are actually just using our own credit But then we''ve launched our tokens, basically we can actually encourage more rewards or loyalties as well as the gamers they can enjoy in terms of value appreciation Because it''s a supply, we have a consistent supply and demand in our current ecosystems And it brings additional benefit and also additional competition advantage Comparating us and so our competitors Thank you so much Jason, thank you so much just for the question And our next startup, Liquidium He''s going to be presenting, Su Xu, Asia Growth Lead Please welcome him on stage Good afternoon everybody, good afternoon Josh I''m Su from Liquidium Liquidium is a leading Bitcoin DeFi app We focus on Bitcoin ecosystem Why do we choose this market? Although the capital market or Bitcoin is much larger than Ethereum The fundable token and ordinals are much smaller So we have huge potential in this market But Bitcoin asset is not as liquid as other ecosystems Imagine that you hold a 10k USD or you know and you want 5k tomorrow But you don''t want to sell it, what can you do? Liquidium is born to solve this pain point We are the learning protocol for native Bitcoin assets like ordinals, runes and BRC20 And every transaction is executed on layer 1 to ensure the security and decentralization The platform is very simple to use You just need to select Cardo, click Borrow and it''s done The process is similar for both lenders and borrowers We have launched our startup for over 2 years And we have 4 million total funding right now And just last year we completed around 400 million total loan volume 84k loans and we generate 165k revenue per month So what''s our business model? The business model is very simple We charge 20% of the interest And from this simple business model we generate 1.6 million last year And unlike most startups, we are already profitable Despite being profitable, we show strong growth in both volumes and loans But we are more ambitious We want to become our way of Bitcoin So here''s the roadmap in 2025 We''ve already delivered customer loans and instant loans And the next quarter we will deliver the biggest products of liquid ever The cross-chain liquid pool So at that time you will be able to borrow BTC against USDT USDC against BTC and much more It won''t be achieved with an A-class team Liquidium is funded by 3 crypto-native builders And they were members of Bitcoin Frontier Fund And they are also board members of Liquidium And within one year we grow to 12 people 12 employees from 8 different countries And we do not fight alone We are backed by the leading venture capitals Industry leaders and external advisors That''s all for my pitch I hope you enjoy it Thank you Thank you Maybe you can just quickly explain So you mentioned that transactions And sort of everything is settled on a Bitcoin layer 1 So how exactly does that work? Yes Basically we use DLC Just create log contract You can see it as a smart contract on Bitcoin So it''s a decentralized and security method Yeah And just quickly on the health of the loans and the LTV and liquidations So how do you sort of manage the risks within these lending pools? Yeah, well we do not Currently we do not use liquidation But we use another mechanism It''s default The process is similar You collateralize your house to a bank And you get your loans And if you default The bank will have your house And they can sell it through your house So we do not have liquidation but default Yeah Yeah Thank you Thank you so much Thank you so much Thank you so much to Sushu And the last startup for the semi-finals We have Domi Chain, Rooney Chakravorty He is the Chief Architect The floor is yours Three minutes I''m here to introduce Domi Chain The high performance blockchain fortified by AI and trusted by all Now fast chains are nothing new There''s Solana, Sui, Aptos But some of these only have 100 nodes Others can go down for hours They aren''t perfect We need a fast chain that''s decentralized, secure, and does not go down Introducing Domi The first AI-secured blockchain Now what does AI-secured mean? Well we have two types of nodes First are the core nodes These are your traditional blockchain validators And second are the AI nodes Now the AI nodes They locally run an AI model specifically designed to detect risky events like DDoS and prevent them Now these nodes act as a decentralized firewall protecting the network and averting network disruptions We also enhance our security by storing snapshots of our assets on Bitcoin Which is the gold standard of blockchain security For our core protocol We combine fast Byzantine agreement with Solana''s proof of history to achieve high speed and scalability Now fast Byzantine agreement has a self-run lottery mechanism Immediate finality and a very low chance of an adversary attack It''s also more scalable than Solana''s PBFT As when more nodes join our network our speed does not get diminished We''ve also developed a Wasm virtual machine Now this supports more languages that developers are already familiar with including Solidity Comparison between us and Solana We have a shorter block time We also have the potential to be more decentralized As our hardware requirements for our nodes are much lower We''re more scalable Our fast Byzantine agreement is more scalable And we''re much more secure Our AI nodes and Bitcoin snapshotting make us much more secure than Solana We also have a close partnership with a satellite company And in the future using satellites We''ll be able to achieve synchronization of all blockchain validators At the same time within the hemisphere Some of our milestones October 31st our test tent went live And as of now we''re grateful to have over 2 million users Some of our future milestones is our satellite combination We''re currently deploying thousands of AI nodes And we''re also talking with some DAP projects Our team, Dr. Jack Ding is our founder and CEO He has 23 years of experience designing high performance solutions for NASDAQ and the World Bank I''m Arunee Chakravorty I have over 8 years of AI model design and deployment And 5 years in the blockchain industry Dr. David Castiel, our VP of satellite He has over 30 years of experience in satellite technology And Dr. Cyrus Lingrode Also has some very impressive credentials to his name Some of the partners we''re grateful to be working with And our contact information Thank you Thank you Just quickly on your test net metrics Yeah How many nodes validators you''ve had on the test net? So we have a couple dozen nodes Yep And the performance metrics that you mentioned Yeah The throughput, the finality, obviously the block time is kind of there But have you done like any tests? Yeah, we''ve tested them and they''re verified Yeah So were they done sort of in a geo-distributed manner or like Sorry, can you repeat that? Were they done in the same region or like geo-distributed? Or global Global, yeah And what were they here again? Like how did you kind of load test the network? We have an explorer and we have multiple ways we can test this And once again, so what exactly is the sort of main benefit of using AI like within the actual network setup? Yeah, so the AI knows they act like a decentralized firewall, they detect network traffic and they analyze the riskiness of transactions You know for a DDoS attack we can detect it before it actually impacts the network and prevent it Yeah, and obviously like for any layer one kind of the main challenge is like once you build it even if it''s a high performance and has certain property advantages like over the other networks the main challenge is actually finding the market fit and sort of attracting developers to the platform. I know you mentioned wasm which sort of opens it up to the kind of wider category of the users but how actually going to like integrate it with the existing system or liquidity the development stacks and so forth. Yeah, so we have some cross chain compatibility as well. And of course our wasm is a big feature for us. And we''re also talking with some other DAP projects and some integration over there. So we already have DEXs and NFT marketplaces too. Thank you so much. Sorry Vladimir, we have to finish. Thank you so much Rooney and thank you everybody. Thank you to our judges. This concludes the Finals are coming. Thank you so much. This concludes the pre-finals. We are going to have the finals at 3.20 on this stage.

We are all gathered from truly around the world at ConsenSys Hong Kong. This is the Open Money Summit and this is the stage where you''re going to learn all things about how traditional finance and the digital ecosystem are converging and intersecting. I''m Tira Gray, Managing Director of Coindesk Events, and it''s truly a pleasure to welcome you in our very first session, which could not be more appropriate to start the day with, from Wall Street to crypto. We have three esteemed Wall Street veterans joining us today for this opening session. It is my pleasure to welcome them to the stage. The at scale is best represented by the over 8,000 attendees of which over 75% traveled from outside of Hong Kong to join us. We have nearly 100 countries represented here today. Second is to leverage Hong Kong''s unique geographic position to be a gateway to Asia. We have gathered the top voices and ecosystems from around the region to provide attendees an effective and efficient way to gain substantive insight into the Asia region. And finally, third is to showcase Hong Kong. This is my home and it is our ambition to lead the Web3 industry in how conferences can incorporate the uniqueness of our host city. It''s been our desire with ConsenSys to incorporate iconically Hong Kong elements into the official conference experience and to get you to fall in love with our city. One of the best examples of this is the partnership that we have as the first ever Web3 Cup race sponsor for the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which we will be hosting the ConsenSys Cup tonight at the Happy Valley Racecourse, an iconically Hong Kong experience you should not miss. On top of that, there are over 330 side events scattered across the city this week. I hope that you get the chance to experience everything the city of Hong Kong has to offer. We sincerely appreciate how much time, effort and resources you have invested into making ConsenSys Hong Kong one of the most important Web3 conferences globally this year. We also appreciate how much time, a lot of the people who have done this work, we are here today. Thank you. Those are some incredible stats, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Joe Son. Zao Sang-hao. Wow, I am just beyond energized by the enthusiasm and the excitement that''s in this room right now. Thank you so much to everyone who traveled from near and far here to Hong Kong to join us this week. On behalf of CoinDesk, we are thrilled to be building on the legacy of the Consensus Conference, the longest running and the most respected digital asset conference in the world by expanding and growing and bringing the experience here to Asia. This marks the first major crypto gathering this year, really setting the stage for 2025. Even though we''re just a few weeks into this year, it''s already been a landmark start to 2025 with so much happening in the space. What an exciting time to be in the digital assets industry and to all be gathered here together. We''re seeing real progress from around the world as governments like right here in Hong Kong develop clear crypto regulations. And as a result, after what feels like many years of waiting, more institutions are entering the space. And institutional adoption is really starting to gain some momentum. We''re discovering new practical use cases for blockchain technology more and more every single day. And finally, the entire space is buzzing with new entrants who are just driving this innovation and growth. So as you walk the halls of the convention center over these next few days, as you listen in on panels, as you partake in meetings, I hope you''ll have the opportunity to really explore and discuss all of these exciting developments that are happening. I hope you meet with some great people. I hope you learn a ton. And I also hope you close some deals, which is what consensus is really, really all about. So again, I want to thank you all for being here. We hope you have an incredible and productive time here at this conference. And we look forward to seeing you in just a few months at our flagship conference, consensus conference, which is happening this year in Toronto in May. So thank you so much. And without further ado, I''ll let Michael introduce our honorary keynote speaker today. Thank you. Thank you so much, Sarah. So with that, I would now like to invite the Honorable Mr. Paul Chen, Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR, to join us on stage to deliver his opening keynote.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.108', NULL, 'https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-bitcoin-the-basis-for-a-new-financial-systema-14', '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');
INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('beyond_trading__how_crypto_is_shaping_the_market', 'Beyond Trading_ How Crypto is Shaping the Market', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hello, how''s everybody today? Are you excited? This is going to be an exciting panel for us. So let me just make the introductions, though these guys don''t need it. We have Hong Fang from OKEx, we have Gracie Chen from BitGate, and we have Armani Ferente from Backpack. And we''re going to be talking about a lot of things today. So you guys ready to get started? Yeah. Let''s do it. All right. Great. So the first question is obviously about the market. So what do you guys think? Where are we in this crypto cycle? Is it still a bull market? Is it not? Is it almost over? What are your thoughts on that? I''m horrible at predicting price. First of all, that''s a disclaimer. I think this market has been very interesting and unique. I personally think of it as almost something like a barbell, where on the one hand it''s driven by Bitcoin ETF narrative, and on the other hand it''s really meme. I think what it represents really is about community, right? Bitcoin ETF, it''s community, but really with the support from the regulatory regime, giving more access to risk-averse capital, who wants to get into crypto. And then for meme, it''s also about community, but it''s more for the risk-seeking capital, who wants to be in crypto. So I think that''s really how I see this cycle. From our perspective, at OKEx, we really look at it not from a price perspective, because we think of ourselves as infrastructure player. So we want to continue to build our product, regardless of what the price is. And I personally think that when the price is less dramatic, we actually have more time to build properly in the market. So... Well, sometimes when I joke with my friends, I call this period of time, I call it trash time. What I mean by that is basically... I''m stealing that, by the way. You see that? Bitcoin has hit 100k in December. Last few weeks, there''s lots of meme coins, Libra, Trump, millennia, lots of basically meme coins coming out. And for me, because I''m working in Y3, and for our crypto industry, I see them not as enemy, but I feel they are just getting liquidity from our industry and take it out and never come back. So this week, I guess, especially after Libra and lots of scams coming out from those meme coins launch, people start to think, do we really need those celebrity meme coins to get liquidity from our industry? And when can we expect true innovations and true macroeconomics catalysts such as the Bitcoin strategic reserve in the US in some other countries, together with, you know, macro, more fiscal and monetary policies coming out? Seems that until maybe June or May this year, lots of things are still ambiguous. But similar to Hong Feng, I''m not a trader, I''m not a predictor, but I would personally think this is a little bit trash time, but trash time is not trashy. Trash time is probably the best time to be more focused on your own product, to build, to really create value for your targeted group, either, you know, retail users, institutional clients, or your partners, your community, etc. For us, that''s what we do. And that''s probably how we survived the last bear market, just by very much focusing on our own time. Yeah. Armani, what are your thoughts? So, you''re asking this question in the context of a single cycle. I would reframe it and ask the question in the context of like, where are we in aggregate across like crypto history as a whole? And it''s a lot easier to think about, you know, how to position yourself when you think in those terms, because prices go up, prices go down. It''s impossible to predict exactly where you are in the cycle. And if you try to predict that, you''re going to get into trouble. So where are we today? So we, you know, I came into the industry off the back of the Ethereum white paper. That was the thing that nerds signed to me. The concept of a global world computer, a trust minimized computing machine that we can have a whole new generation of developers build stuff on. For the past, you know, three, four or five years, we all have been chasing this concept of how do we make the thing go fast? How do we make the thing scale? And how do we build actual applications that can genuinely like change the world? Not just like speculation and trading back and forth and watching prices go up and down. We faced so many headwinds on that journey, everything from, you know, technical problems and a seemingly impossible task to regulatory issues, particularly in the U.S., something that hits really close home to me. I''m in the U.S. I''m an American. I''ve been building our company abroad. I think with the incoming new Trump administration, it''s been such a sigh of relief, especially as an American, where there''s so much stigma. In the U.S. in particular, it''s been so hard to get the best talent into the space. This cannot be emphasized enough. All of the best talent has been going in AI, not crypto. And a big part of it has been because of the stigma. And I mean, there''s a bunch of good things about meme coins, a bunch of bad things about meme coins. But just the Trump, like, you know, the Trumpian just like, you know, embrace of the industry has been such a positive inflection point for the United States and U.S. capital markets, which are the most important capital markets in the world. They''re the deepest. They''re the most trusted. They''re the most liquid. It''s where the large majority of value is in the world. And it''s been mostly absent as crypto is really flourished outside of the U.S., in particular here in Asia. This is really the heart of crypto up until now. And I think, you know, we''re certainly dealing with this turbulence with, you know, as you said, all the scams, whether it''s Libra, the legitimate pump and dumps that happen that nobody''s happy about. But we''ve achieved so much as a collective industry, whether it''s Solana and like the amazing technology that''s been built there, whether it''s, you know, we had Evan from sweet that was on this stage. It''s like quite a bit ago, like so much amazing engineering work has been achieved up until now. And the tides are certainly turning irrespective of where prices are today, irrespective of where we are in this market cycle. In aggregate, when you zoom out, if you want, if you want to say that things have never been more positive and more exciting and more inspirational for anybody building into the space. And so like the metric I look at is just it''s very simple. I don''t care what the prices are. All I care about is human capital. All I care about is what are the engineers that are just graduating university, like wanting to do for the rest of their lives? Are they going to commit to crypto? Are they going to join a, you know, a social network? Are they going to join an AI company? And we''ve never seen, I think, more people excited about dedicating kind of their careers to crypto since basically Trump got elected. And so I think it''s an amazing time to be in the industry and it''s a great time to build. I agree with you all. Like probably 18 months ago, everybody thought crypto is dead. Right. And we''re still here. We''re still standing. So it''s it''s like sort of like a positive story. Right. But you guys know traders better than anybody else with exchanges, with everything. Do you think have you seen any shifts in trader behavior? Like is there something traders are now looking at uniquely that is different from the previous cycles? Or is there something that traders are completely missing out on? From our experience, because from a customer segment perspective, we really serve a broad range of customers ranging from institutions to retail. I think on the institutional side, there is continued adoption of institutions at a wider scale, regardless of the regulatory landscape, because I think the direction is pretty clear. Bitcoin is here to stay. Crypto is here to stay. Retail side, I think there is increasing market share taken by DEX. That is a very clear trend that we see last year. Our OKEx app, which we have been really building over the last three years, is really making a point of providing that option of giving both a C5 choice and a C5. choice as well as a Web3 choice to the customer. And we see the AUM accumulated on the Web3 side really overtaking C5 side, which was a surprise to us actually by the end of the last year. But it also shows that there is a lot more traffic, a lot more asset, a lot more infrastructure being developed on the Web3 side. The other major trend that we see is, again, as we continue to build our C5 infrastructure, you know, we''ve got our regulated platform launched in quite a few jurisdictions over the last 12 months. You know, in Australia, in Dubai, most recently in EA. So we do see continued interest from those markets in the regulated environment. But obviously that population not only looking for trading, but also look for additional yield, additional convenience and obviously, you know, sophistication and creation within that regulated, reliable infrastructure. So I think there is a lot of interesting dynamics happening and, you know, we are pretty bullish on the long term direction of our industry. But again, I think what it means is that we have to focus on what we need to build instead of the cycle changes. Yeah. Gracie, what are your thoughts? Gracie, what are your thoughts? Yeah, similar to OKEx, we also have something called Bigger Wallet. So I would say these two exchanges are two of the most strong, the strongest exchanges who have put in lots of resources into building their DEX part of the service, not just focusing on the centralized exchanges itself. So in 2024, we also saw lots of growth on our DEX, a bigger wallet. They hit 45 million users, a lot of them coming from very so-called developing countries, for example, in Africa, in Southeast Asia, in Latin America, and lots of growth from certain ecosystem like TONG, like meme coin cycles, et cetera. So I guess that''s one trend that I observed from more centralized exchange to decentralized exchange, but also like integration. Another trend that I''m seeing is from the institutional interest. For example, I''ve had my, I worked in Web2 industry and in traditional financial banking industry before joining Bigger in 2022. So lots of my friends from my Web2 world, it''s only end of 24, like come and approach me and ask me for advice in terms of having a little bit of their current allocation, the total like financial allocation, maybe 2%, maybe 5% in cryptocurrency. What should they, what should they, what should they do? What should they look for? So, of course, I told them some of my, you know, personal financial kind of principles, like don''t do too much leverage, maybe for the majority of your, your, your cryptocurrency still put it in Bitcoin or Bitcoin proxy. But some hurdles for them is that they don''t feel comfortable holding Bitcoins or Ethereum directly. They feel much more comfortable holding ETF or even buying MSTR, the MicroStrategy US stock. So that''s why we see Bitcoin dominance increase a lot in 2024 from, you know, slightly less than 50% to now over 60% because those money only went to Bitcoin. No other altcoins, not even Solana, Ethereum, XRP. So for our industry really to attract more traditional financial investors or institutional clients, what they need to see is number one regulation change for them to, in order to invest in the industry more compliantly, more, more easily basically. And secondly, more reputational risk need to be solved because many of them after FTS collapse feel afraid or feel a little bit, have a little bit moral hazard by investing in crypto. And the third, the third thing that we need to see more changes is real innovations. Every one of us are focusing and we mentioned real innovations. Like when we say blockchain is this very innovative technology that is equivalently important to AI. How can people really use that? Right now still a lot of like the product market fit are probably in, you know, exchange business, speculations, trading, not necessarily evoluting everyone''s daily life. Unlike, you know, chat, GPT, deep sec, you can experience that. So these three things, regulations, reputation rates, and real innovations are some hurdles that I think are preventing the traditional financial industry investors to enter more here. Yeah, but these two trends that I see, you know, retail users probably interested in lots of DAX and more high nervous individuals, family offices, clients want to enter the industry, but there are hurdles. Armani, what are your thoughts? I think a lot of the key notes have been hit. I would, when thinking about trader habits, I think the story of the past year really has been the rise of the decentralized exchange. I think there''s no doubt about that, especially as these systems continue to scale and as they continue to become more and more just feasible for building financial applications that are used by people around the world. I think Jupiter on Solana is like a wonderful example. Uniswap on Ethereum doing their own roll up is another great example. Hyper liquid, probably like the biggest, most, most noise being made this year in terms of DEXs that have launched. But I think when a lot of people make this DeFi C5 dichotomy, they frame it in the context of almost like an engineering problem where they''re referencing the way that the architecture of the system. But I wouldn''t, I don''t think that''s the right dichotomy. I think the dichotomy is actually censorship resistance versus compliance. And I think that is ultimately going to be the end state of more or less every single project in crypto. Either you, you know, you live in a society, right? You don''t live in an industry. You live in a rule of law. And although there is all of these like new assets that are created, right? You still have to comply with all the rules, right? You don''t just like go and rob a liquor store or whatever, right? It''s the exact same thing for an exchange, right? And as kind of more rules and regulations kind of come into play, that will be kind of a hard requirement. But then there''s the set of fully decentralized censorship resistant, you know, products that run on so many globally distributed machines that it''s literally an undefined problem to actually try to regulate them. Like, how do you shut down Uniswap? It''s like, I got, I don''t know. There''s no single person that has any given point of control over it. And so I think the roles of, of exchanges will continue to evolve to meet one of these two worlds. And you see this with more and more people now building decentralized exchanges because they don''t want to solve any of the compliance problems or the folks that, you know, do have that expertise actually go and, you know, get all the licenses and comply with all the little people. And that is ultimately how we''re going to get to the next leg of, of industry maturity where, you know, I said it before, I''ll say it again. And so, you know, the markets that are important in the world are regular, like they have all the value. I shouldn''t say important. The current markets that have all the value, all of the goods and services that run the entire world, they''re all regulated markets. That''s where all the trillions of dollars of value is. And it''s, and it''s untapped at the moment. Everything that exists in crypto is great. They''re awesome engineering problems. We all know and love it, but it''s more or less meaningless in relative terms. And so a big part of, you know, that the opportunity and the challenges for all of us to solve is to go and bring all that value into back it by blockchains. And that takes a lot of work. That''s not just engineering work. It''s legal work. It''s compliant work. It''s making relationships and, and, and, and building trust with, you know, society as a whole, whether it''s like regulators, whether it''s lawmakers, whether it''s just general sentiment across, you know, constituents in various places. But we ultimately have to be building things that fit into that mold. And I think that is a big part of the story for the industry as it matures. My next question is going to be sort of like a two part question. You guys have already sort of touched on this. It''s, it''s something for exchanges that you guys talk about all the time is regulation and policy, right? With sort of a more crypto friendly environment in the US, do you think US being sort of the top dog in crypto and the other countries, do you think that''s going to lead to a wave of more regulatory cap clarity in some of the regions where it wasn''t there before? And in terms of a centralized exchange, like what, what''s one clarity that''s missing that will really help you guys out to expand in other areas? Like, is this, is there something that a regulator can focus on to help you guys to differentiate more between centralized and decentralized exchange and help you gain more market share? I think crypto, like other industries, is a global industry, but it''s also what we''ve realized is that it''s also a very extremely local industry. I think US regulation definitely has a big outsized impact on the regulatory landscape in other markets as well in addition to US, just given that it is US. However, you know, we''ve seen that different jurisdictions are taking their own steps from a regulatory landscape perspective. And I think that trend will continue regardless of where US is heading towards. US is already lagging behind a little bit, it''s catching up. But, and from a community perspective also, I think the local community on the retail side, different regions, Asia, right? Big, big clusters of community, Asia, MENA, Europe, you know, US and Latin America, Africa. These are all very regional markets that stand on its own. Even if crypto in itself is a borderless industry, I think when it comes to actual development, they all stand on their own. The only piece that I think that US regulation will actually two pieces that I think will have outsized impact on other markets are one, the banking channel, the US banking channel, particularly given the importance of correspondence banks in the global capital flow. I think secondly, the institutional capital. I think one of the things that I keep a close eye on is really how quickly institution adoption happens. Once there''s clear regulatory clarity in US, I think the Wall Street will definitely flood in. They want to get in right now, but there''s still a hurdle for them to get in. So I do think that that actually creates opportunity for more crypto native exchanges and builders, which who can actually take advantage of this opportunity to build in a proper way, to build the bridge between Trefi and Web3, but at the same time also invest very heavily in Web3 and continue to foster that grassroots community before Wall Street coming and over financialize this industry. So it will be interesting to continue to see. I think US is not going to be, well, my personal take, the changes are not going to come that quickly. But, you know, we all know that we are in a very volatile year with the new administration. So we''ll see. Yeah. Similar. I don''t think the changes and regulation clarity will be out soon. I actually chatted with a few so-called the new Trump administers crypto advisors. Like they have 20 something crypto advisors who are coming from top VCs, top Web3 groups, more related to the US. I''m not one of them, sadly. We don''t do any business in the US at all. But I''ve been keeping updated about the progress right now. I know David Sachs is driving lots of the initiatives. He''s a very good friend of Donald Trump and he has lots of connections in the space and he made lots of positive changes there. But still, you know, how do they, you know, even something like whether Ethereum is a commodity or security, right? Simple things like that. Or whether it''s under DOJ, CFTC, SEC regulation, it''s not clear. Seems that all these entities, federal governments and the state''s government, they each has a say. So US has a very, very complicated political system right now. And when it goes to regulating a centralized change or even, you know, defining certain token as a commodity or security, things like that is very, very unclear. You know, ETFs approval, similarly, not clear. You know, DOJ, Solana, XRP, whether they will have ETF or not. So we''ve been waiting for lots of things to be concrete because I can''t speculate on speculations. I can''t make decisions about whether we want to enter a market purely on, you know, those kind of news around whether there is regulation or not and how that regulation might be. So we need to wait for those things to be unfolded, then make a decision whether we want to enter the market or not. In 2025, I don''t see us doing that. We might, you know, reevaluate this decision of like us entering the US market later when we have more concrete plans. But also we want to, we probably want to work with some third party partners in order to fast speed this process. Armani, what about you? I would break the question up into two different components. So the first component are all the questions around the assets themselves. I think it''s very hard to generalize because the rules and laws are different everywhere around the world. But to take US as an example, there''s been a remarkable amount of clarity given by the new administration. David Sachs literally came out and said, NFT is collectibles, meme coins collectibles. And then everybody kind of, kind of went crazy. A huge unlock for anybody building decentralized applications on a censorship resistant chain. So there''s the asset question themselves. And that affects us in the form of listings in particular. And that''s an important conversation. The other component that I would break this question down into is this question of, well, do the regulation, actually apply to me as a builder? And to me, there is intuitively a very clear decision function to answer that question. And it''s very simple. Do I have control or do I not have control? So it''s something so censorship resistant. It has so many globally distributed people around the world operating this thing that it''s not, I can''t just like unilaterally do anything. You know, you could basically ask the question, is there a multisig involved? And it doesn''t matter if you''re a centralized exchange. It doesn''t matter if you''re on Solana. It doesn''t matter if you''re on Ethereum. If there''s a single point of control, well, then it should be pretty clear and pretty obvious that the regulations do apply to you in the same way they apply to any type of financial institution in whatever region that you''re operating in, whether it''s the US or Japan, Europe or whatever. And this is a single question. And I think there''s been, you know, I think there''s certainly to me a lot of clarity around that. The challenge and where the help needs to come in is reducing the barrier to entry. The barrier to entry is super high. If you want to go get regulated in the US, like, here''s a silly example. I''m from the US, spent my entire life there, like grew up in California. It''s the most important market to me. It''s where my family is. You know, I want to do things by the book in the US, right? American dynamism or whatever, right? Like, you know, Trump gets elected, hurrah. He unleashes all the creativity for all the depths and anybody building something in a decentralized fashion. But if you''re trying to build a regulated business, well, there''s still an enormous amount of hurdles if you don''t have infinite money, right? You still have to go through the 50 state MTL process in states like maybe this is like the best example, like a state like New York, for example, where it''s the crypto capital of the United States. All of the talent is there. It''s, you know, it''s where all of Wall Street is. It''s an amazing place. Everybody loves New York. But you can''t operate an exchange in New York if you want to actually go after the bit license. So, you know, we want to go after the bit license. We want to go after all 50 states. And we can''t hire any engineers in New York that have access to our AWS infrastructure. And it''s like, well, that''s quite unfortunate. Like, I want to support my country, but you''re telling me I can''t hire anyone there. And so I think there''s these barriers, I think, it''s the friction that I think it slows us down collectively. But I do think that it is clear. It''s just difficult. You see Coinbase today literally just launched a sole futures market in the USA. And so there''s certainly a pathway to be offering these products in the US. It''s just really hard. And there''s, you know, a ton of barriers. And it takes, you know, only the most, like, rigorous due diligence process, you know, from the regulators to actually approve you to go live in the US. And I think what I would love to see is just, you know, a maybe, you know, providing a more, an easier path for young startups that maybe don''t have all the resources. Right? If you''re, if you''re, you know, just, you know, Mark Zuckerberg graduating or dropping out of college or whatever, how do you build an exchange? You, you can''t. Good luck. It''s, it''s literally impossible. Um, uh, and, uh, at least not in a regulated fashion. Uh, and, and so I think that is the conversation, uh, for me and something I would love to see, uh, progress on. I mean, this has been a great and insightful conversation with the three of you, but unfortunately we''re out of time. And we have to give the stage to other people, but it was amazing talking to you all. I hope it''s been insightful for the crowd and yeah, we''ll see you all guys later. Thank you. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('bitcoin__the_basis_for_a_new_financial_system_', 'Bitcoin_ The Basis for a New Financial System_', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hello everyone. This topic is on Bitcoin and the new financial system. So with me is Samson, Adam and David. Do you guys just want to do a quick intro about yourselves and what you guys are working on right now? Who first? Me. Let''s go that way. Okay. My name is Samson Mo. I''m the CEO of Jan3. We''re a company focused on accelerating hyper-Bitcoinization. And that means accelerating the adoption of Bitcoin around the world. We work with governments, central banks, regulators, and we also developed a Bitcoin wallet called Aqua to spur grassroots adoption. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. And Blockstream works on all kinds of Bitcoin tech from software, layer two wallets, hardware wallets, and asset management around all Bitcoin-centric things. Hey, good morning. I''m David Hsieh, co-founder of the Babylon Protocol. So our protocol is on Bitcoin staking, how to take any Bitcoin holders, any Bitcoin to provide security to any proof-of-stake networks in the world. I''m also a professor at Stanford University. Thank you, guys. So we were just discussing backstage about the current cycle, how Bitcoin''s kind of been going through this sidestep approach. So consolidation, reprice higher, consolidation, the seventh one since the cycle low. So the volatility is kind of being compressed out of Bitcoin. And yeah, so we could just start with there, what your guys'' thoughts are on the current price action, and anything in terms of where you think we could be going in the short term. You want to go for it? Who wants that one? Yeah, I mean, it''s curious that there is a lot of buying that is transparent, that the market knows about. So the ETF inflows are some multiple of the Bitcoins mined every day. MicroStrategy and the other strategy companies doing a similar play are also buying, you know, two times plus Bitcoin mined per day. And of course, you''ve got, you know, the retail buyers who are dollar cost averaging and buying. And because the price is set at the margin, so that means somebody has to be selling. Now, if we were talking about last year, after the DeFi contagion and bankruptcies, there were some structural sellers who were sort of forced sellers, and miners who were restructuring or replacing fleets or going through a less profitable period. But I think all of that is behind us now. FTX is starting to pay out their dollars from selling Bitcoin ill-advisedly in the mid-20K range. And so, anyway, so clearly somebody is selling to match this. Otherwise, the price would already be moving upwards again. Yeah, so since September, as we were discussing, 1.1 million Bitcoin have been sold since September, October of last year. And it''s quite incredible to see that that amount of Bitcoin has been sold and the price has gone up 50%, around 60,000 to 100,000. And obviously, with Trump''s presidential win, that pinned Bitcoin on 100,000. And we''ve kind of been in this trading range, what, from about 91,000 to about 110,000. But it is quite incredible. And Samson, you''re an advocate for price suppression. And it''s so, as a volatile asset, that the volatility is kind of being stripped away. Yeah. Any thoughts on that? Any on that? Well, it seems like it''s some sort of price suppression. If you look at the price movement, we kind of peak, and then we stay steady and chop sideways. And it''s good. You could say it''s consolidation, but it just looks very manufactured. The very tight range in which we''re trading at just doesn''t look natural at all. And then, of course, you have dips when there''s something in the altcoin world forcing capitulation, and then we get pulled down with it a bit. But overall, I would say it''s okay. You just have to be patient, much like with the Bitcoin ethos. It''s about the long game. Yeah. You''re buying something to hold for long term, not something you''re trading daily. So I think it''s healthy to consolidate. And then usually after some consolidation, we''ll rip upwards. Yeah. No, I agree. So if we want to go into the corporate adoption of Bitcoin, so we could discuss the public companies that are buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset. I think we''ve had about 20, 25 announcements in the past few months of either thinking about Bitcoin as a treasury asset or actually doing it. And I think we should start with MicroStrategy. I think that''s the most talked about stock on the planet right now. And Adam, I know you''re an active trader on Mike''s strategy. And so you take a really close look at the price action with it. But what are your initial thoughts with it and anything with his strategy so far? Well, I think last quarter or so they did a lot of ATM selling, i.e. selling shares to fund buying Bitcoin and less convertible note selling where in the earlier half of last year, they''d been alternating a billion of ATMs, a billion of converts. And so I think people were kind of feeling it''s time for sub converts. And actually that was announced overnight. Yes. But they''re doing a two billion converts and they have a target in one of the earnings calls where they said they''re aiming for 1.3 times leverage. So about 30% debt ratio. Yeah. And I think you said at the moment it''s about 12%. So they''ve got scope to buy maybe about 15 billion of convertible notes to get to their debt target. But of course, they can also continue to maintain a debt ratio or leverage ratio while selling ATMs and selling more converts and maintain that target debt ratio. So they''ve got to assume they''re going to try and get past the 500,000 Bitcoin, which takes about 21,000 more Bitcoin. So I would assume they will achieve that in the next quarter. Yeah. For me and a lot of the people that I''ve spoken to, they''ve actually been orange-pilled on his Q3 earnings call back in October when he issued the 42 billion capital raise, the 21 billion of convertible notes and the 21 billion ATM issuance. And on the market cap at the time, I think it was like 80 billion. So it was like a 50% dilution on the stock. And on that day, which was really interesting, the stock went up, Bitcoin went down. And as we know, like dilution, that''s one of the worst things for investors. But for a mic trashy holder, that accretive dilution, that Bitcoin per share is something that we all kind of gravitate towards and why we''re such avid buyers of the stock. So I think that was the largest capital raise in finance history. So he''s kind of, I think he''s learning on the job and just to see how much the market can take in terms of dilution and how much capital he can actually accrete for the company. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think it does take some getting used to for people who are used to valuing stocks, that they would not want to see too much dilution very quickly. They''d want to see the dilution, the capital raised from dilution used to create new product lines and demonstrate enterprise value. But with the Bitcoin strategy, the enterprise value is realized the next day when they buy Bitcoin and put it on the balance sheet. And so really, the question is more, what do you think is the fair market MNav, like multiple of the asset value, either the value of the Bitcoin on the balance sheet compared to the market cap, which is currently around two. So based on historic average levels, I would say that is actually quite cheap for microstrategy terms. And personally, my gut feel and just some loose modeling is that is like long term sustainable because you''re just looking for once Bitcoin is like post-hyper Bitcoinization, where Bitcoin is fully deployed and maybe not going up very fast. Then the MNav on a company like Microstrategy, presumably dropped to one or some small multiple. And so the question is, how much Bitcoin can they accrete per share between now and 10 or 20 years? Can they double it? And given that they increased the Bitcoin per share by 73% last year, that doesn''t seem particularly difficult to do with an MNav of two. So I would say like three or even higher is probably still gives you a discount versus the long term achievable Bitcoin per share. Yeah, it''s quite incredible. And to see how the stock trades on any given day, as an $80 billion market cap, it''s like the top 10 most traded stock or the implied volatility on the stock outpaces any of the magnificent seven. So he''s like trying to integrate into all these different products. So obviously the preferred stock, which was his latest offering, which is a hybrid between the fixed income and equity. And then something I wanted to discuss with you guys is like as Bitcoiners to get that yield in a risk adjusted manner. So obviously with the fixed income product that he''s got, it''s an $8 dividend. So the dividend percentage is at the moment is given on an 8 or 10% basis. And I think we can see that people are running towards these kind of yield products. So what are your guys thoughts on yield? Obviously we, and staking, and obviously we go to David about that, but to try and find that kind of balance on a risk adjusted basis. I mean, in terms of what MicroStrategy is doing, it''s possible because you have, you know, even with those perpetual preferred shares, some kind of dividend and they have the ability to pay the dividend in class A shares. But in terms of a direct or native low risk Bitcoin return, it''s actually very hard to achieve a safe return on Bitcoin. And actually, you know, the bear market a couple of years ago was partly triggered by, you know, sort of risk taken while offering yield by a three arrows capital, Genesis, Gemini, BlockFi. Which all stems from that GBC premium. Right. So, I mean, it was basically the reason people were able to offer what was clearly unsustainable yields, but market them as sustainable is because they''re making their strategy was they will lend unsecured to hedge funds making directional bets, which is obviously a crazy proposition. And so it inevitably fell apart. But now in terms of what could be achievable in a low risk, I would say something in a region of 2 to 4%, but you have to be very, very careful how you do that to avoid bringing on like custody risks and things like that. Yeah. So David, with Babylon, if you could tell the audience about it and then just in terms of how you navigate with your staking product. Yeah. So the original concept of Bitcoin staking is the observation that staking is growing to be a very large industry in the proof of stake networks. It has a trust risk minimizing way of earning yield staking. So we want to bring the same trust minimizing capability for Bitcoin stakers to use the Bitcoin and log the asset to provide security and thereby earning the reward. So that''s the basic observation that the reason, one reason why staking is such an important development in the past few years is because of the trust minimizing characteristic of staking. Do you guys have any thoughts on that? Well, I mean, I think the question, I mean, there are some technical risks around sort of smart contracts and bridges and obviously staking will typically involve wrapped Bitcoin, which is effectively custodial or literally custodial in most cases. So that''s a kind of different risk. I mean, I think the custodians will be capable to secure the Bitcoin. But then I think the bigger question is where the yield comes from, which is a kind of Alan Farringdon kind of quote at this point, right? Which is, you know, in some of the other products, I think there are some altcoins out there repeating the Terra Luna formula, paying a high interest rate where the interest... So you would say, well, who''s borrowing at 20% or 40%? And the answer is nobody. It''s, you know, they''re just using pre-mined coins. So it depends per network what is done. So I don''t really know the details of all of them. But that''s, you know, a concern that if there is no borrower who''s naturally generating the return, there''s a question of, is that return long-term sustainable? Or is there a failure point where something bad would happen? So can I respond to these two observations? Very important observation. Yeah. So a solution to do the staking is to bridge the asset into a wrap Bitcoin type asset and then stick on the network. So I think one of the key technical innovation of our pro of the Babylon protocol is that it does not involve bridging. So there''s no bridging of the asset. It''s natively sticked on the Bitcoin chain and the collateralization, that is the so-called slashing, is done through cryptographic means without bridging to the other network. So that reduces the bridging or the custodial risk that Adam mentioned. So that''s the first thing. The second thing about yield. So here I think the focus is on providing security to proof of state networks. And security is a very fundamental and important use case for the network. So the yield is coming from paying for that security. So because we think that security is central to the long-term viability of a network, so we believe also that yield will be sustainable. I think there''s a lot of there''s really no need to look for yield. Yield is sort of a fiat concept that is paired with monetary supply growth. But if you''re thinking about Bitcoin as a new money, not just an asset, but a replacement for all fiat money, then you''re probably better off just hodling your Bitcoin because that will probably outperform any attempts at getting yield. If you look at historically all the problems that have been had, I''m not saying it''s not possible, but like Adam has touched on it, there are risks inherent to searching for yield. So my advice is maybe just hodl. Hudl. So then moving over to more of a macro discussion, looking at the current US administration, what are your guys thoughts on that? And then also any, as we were discussing prior, and you see any currency risk with the dollar index being quite strong, and also gold kind of pricing in a lot of uncertainty. So I think gold''s up about 12% this year. And that''s with US yields at like 5%. So it seems like the market is demanding gold. So yeah, what are your guys thoughts on just the current macro landscape? Hudl. Hudl. Hudl. Hudl. Hudl. I think gold is sort of an indicator that Bitcoin is going to move up. That''s sort of like the the boomer is understanding that something is afoot and we need a safe haven. That leads to the broader marketplace coming to that same understanding for Bitcoin, which is basically just newer gold, digital gold. but the Trump admin I think is better I mean it''s not ideal because he launched a meme coin but you have to take the good with the bad sometimes he did free Ross he did follow through on that promise and there''s no more aggression towards you know Bitcoin and crypto companies which I think would have continued under a Harris administration so you know cup is half full I would rather take the Trump admin and yeah meme coins which don''t really hurt Bitcoin because mean coins don''t compete with Bitcoin in any way you know if anything it''s a capitulation to Bitcoin saying we''re not even gonna make an effort to throw out techno babble and jargon and you know blockchain technology and we''re just a meme now so it''s sort of hyper shit coinization where it''s just about launching a token letting it fly and letting what happens eventually happen which is going down well I mean so that''s that right isn''t that sad hyper shit tonalization because Bitcoin is the first technology we should build on that right to improve technology no well I mean the the Bitcoin dominance index is growing a bit over the last 12 months I guess and it''s gone to like 40 to now just over 60 percent 60 yeah so over 50 percent up roughly so yeah I don''t know I mean I think it''s probably just because the the kind of insider gamification of of the kind of pump and dump phenomena has been compressed so it''s disillusioning the retail investor and so they''re they''re you know leaving or something so I think it''s anyway I think it''s an area where more is less and that''s that''s really what''s going on in terms of the u.s. I think the yeah as Samson said the the macro is good for having more favorable regulations and an SEC that is you know going to stop the choke point 2.0 phenomena where banks were trying to unbank Bitcoin companies and the regulators were just running interference and say you know if they if they create some regulatory clarity open for business I think that''s good and it also works internationally because regulators look at each other so you know there are there are regulators financial regulators in different countries like Singapore Switzerland UK US but are looking at each other for cues and so the US finally becoming more constructive I think will unlock ETFs and other ETF Bitcoin favorable regulations in other jurisdictions which you know helps access to Bitcoin ultimately and I think the other big news you know going back a little bit now before the Trump administration was the approval of the spot ETFs which unfortunately had to be forced through the courts because of the regulators trying to slow down adoption and I think that set the stage for you know the early stages of institutional adoption which I think is still you know it''s early stages and it''s the next wave yes so with the with the ETF holdings I think the the last filing of the 13 s over 30 percent of them in our institutional holdings which is I think gold ETFs is around 40 percent so they think they''re gonna we''re gonna start getting to even higher levels and but we''ve just seen the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund allocate to I bet the blackrock ETF that ETF hit 50 billion in AUM quicker than any other ETFs of all time but I wasn''t really around in 2004 when GLD was launched but a lot of people were saying there''s a lot of synergies between GLD and how the price of gold had a seven-year bull market to 2011 and these consistent inflows and I think as we were saying before that the basis trade is kind of unwinding and now the we''re now kind of seeing these net long positions and so I think yeah these constant inflows almost like the buyers of last resort now with this into with this bidding for Bitcoin so it''s just interesting to see who keeps buying these ETFs and we get them on a quarterly basis so did any of the filings like jump out at you or anything like that well I mean it''s sometimes you have to pick apart some corporate entities are actually you know maybe buying for some other market reason like they''re you know the market makeup or something or they''re holding it for clients but it it''s definitely interesting to see genuine like institutional buyers I think it''s still relatively early so blockstream we hired Sean Bill who''s a well-known hedge fund manager and pension fund manager and he was the manager of the first US public pension funds that put Bitcoin on its balance sheet and that that was achieved in 2021 but I think still now in terms of you know the allocation to Bitcoin asset class amongst pension funds and mutual funds is very low so the institutional adoption I think is more prop kind of so I think you know those pools of capital are extremely large and the allocation so far are very small so you know that adoption when it does come it''s a little bit slow because it you know they want to make a systematic analysis of their risks and so forth but I think that that''s coming in you know in the mid-future as well yeah the two things I''m looking for is that stablecoin regulation where tether already the third biggest buyer three month treasuries and I think if they were a sovereign they''d be like the 20th largest buyer and David Sachs has alluded to the stablecoins buying the US debt to get their yields low and then the other one is the one is the SA B121 where they can start to hold Bitcoin in custody and have it on the balance sheet and so those are the two things that I''m looking at there''s a few banks now that are looking at custody like offering custody solutions and I think the ETFs are a big game changer I don''t think the implications of the ETFs is fully realized yet previous Bitcoin bull runs we''re usually kind of muted because of exchanges needing to onboard and their backlog for months so they cannot KYC people fast enough but with the ETFs now there is no barrier to trad fi capital flowing directly into Bitcoin and we haven''t seen that torrent of capital pouring yet Adam is saying they''re just dipping their toes in you know the sovereign wealth funds are just allocating a droplet of what they have but you can see that it is all coming and when you combine that with the macro trends of miners not needing to sell Bitcoin because they can finance they can borrow like micro strategy and then you have the micro strategy and all the other mini micro strategies buying more than the mine supply and then the ETFs themselves it just sets the stage for a massive wave of maybe 10 20 years of bullish green candles well I think it''s interesting you mentioned gold as a comparison because it''s probably the sort of most logical target for capital reallocation to Bitcoin especially for like ETF buyers they''ll talk to their broker or their financial advisor and say they want to take a stake in Bitcoin so the question is going to be you know this is new capital not you know it''s existing capital rather from their portfolio right so the question but what do you want to sell what do you want to sell so they''ll sell their gold allocation and buy Bitcoin so I think the proportion of gold value that is in ETFs is a lot smaller percentage wise than Bitcoin so I think and prices set at the margin so I think an interesting metric could be you know value bleeding from the gold ETFs into Bitcoin ETFs and you know potentially even in this market cycle starting to take the shine off gold and you know if that phenomena picks up steam people will switch you know to jump on board if they see the capital flight well if you look at gold ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin ETFs are outperforming gold and actually all ETFs from BlackRock the Bitcoin one is the most successful one ever yeah so the trend is pretty clear that Bitcoin is starting to dominate again yeah no I agree and then we''ve only got a minute or so but I just want to get your views on just the fundamentals of the Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs are outperforming gold and actually all ETFs from BlackRock the Bitcoin one is the most successful one ever so in terms of Like I said before, they don''t need to sell Bitcoin anymore, at least the bigger ones, and if they''re public. But the sovereigns, the nation states that are mining Bitcoin, they''re very price insensitive because it''s their power. And you can even build new power installations just to mine Bitcoin with stranded energy. So the entire dynamic has changed massively in terms of mining. And this is probably why we see Hashrate just piling on nonstop, because they''re not really worried about paying for electricity anymore because it''s behind the meter. And I don''t think that''s fully priced in yet. I think there was a bit of a structural thing going on from the bull market a couple of years ago where people overbought miners on pre-orders, and it ended up taking a couple of years until they received the last of their order batches. And so then they found that there wasn''t enough power to put them online. And so because you''ve got all these enterprise buyers with a sunk cost logic, they''re going to put it online if it reduces their loss. And so I think that''s why the Hashrate has been a bit high and suppressed the mining profitability, which otherwise would be roaring at this stage in the market. Right. So I think it recovered, obviously, because the price is a lot higher now, even factoring in the halving, dropping the supply. Of course, the fees aren''t carrying their weight, but I think that''s just due to kind of cycles in the market of different demands for block space, pushing out other uses and then subsiding themselves.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('china_s_blockchains', 'China_s Blockchains', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' All right. So one of the most talked about topics here in Hong Kong is China plus blockchain and China plus crypto. Everyone wonders, you know, will China legalize crypto? How can you have blockchain in China without crypto? And so we''ve got some of the biggest names in crypto plus China to talk about that here on stage. Let''s do some intros, starting with you. Who are you and what do you do? My name is Edith Young. I''m a general partner in Race Capital. So Race Capital, we''re early investor in Solana, in human finance, seller, many, many other crypto projects. But we''ve particularly focused on early stage infrastructure projects. So always looking at L1, L2 and very, very excited being on stage with our awesome speaker today. Yes. Okay. Who''s next? My name is Yifan. Yifan He. I''m the CEO and the founder of Reddy Technology. So we''re basically a blockchain infrastructure, regulated digital currency, digital identity company. So it''s very complicated. So basically a blockchain company. So we are Hong Kong headquartered with offices in Beijing. Yeah. Very nice. And Lawrence? Hi, everyone. I''m Lawrence Chu. I''m the co-founder and CEO of IDA. IDA is a fintech company focused on stable coins. And we''re in process working with the local government here to launch a Hong Kong dollar regulated stable coin. Very nice. Okay. So in mainland China, they embrace blockchain, but not crypto. We''ll start with you, Yifan. Why is that? And how can you have a blockchain without crypto? So we don''t allow guns in China, but we can still make a steal. Okay. So blockchain is a technology and the crypto is an application. So the technology usually is not regulated. So you can build all kinds of applications. But when some application triggers regulations, then that''s – so we need to, you know, make sure, understand the difference between pure technology and the application. So blockchain is a pure technology. That''s why Chinese government embrace the technology. So they''re okay with technology, but not okay with the financial part of that with crypto. But then how can you have a blockchain work without that monetary incentive behind it? That''s why you come from a coin desk. Okay. So let''s say first the stable coin. Okay. Our tokenite deposit from a commercial bank. Most of tokenite deposit from bank will be on permission chain. There''s no crypto. So which means all of them, you know, will be, you know, doesn''t even make sense. Also, you will see this kind of solvent decentralized identity technology. For example, the China Review, the ID we built in China. Right. So that doesn''t involve crypto either. So this is – the blockchain actually is a multi-party kind of system architecture, right? So it actually can apply to many, many user cases. Crypto is just one of them. Interesting. Okay. So for – go ahead, Lawrence. Oh, I was going to chime in to say backstage you were just mentioning some of the applications of blockchain technology in China. I mean, we came across a big state-owned company that was storing petrol. And they used blockchain technology because it''s immutable. And then they could use that information to attest how much gas there was. And that information can be used to connect with banks to do lending and working capital financing. So there''s a lot of application on that side rather than the crypto maybe we know of from another perspective. Interesting. So what do you see, Lawrence, as Hong Kong''s role within China for crypto? Because Hong Kong is part of China, but it''s also a separate jurisdiction with its own rules and laws. So how does Hong Kong fit into the broader China blockchain play? That''s a great question. That''s a great question. And Hong Kong has had its unique role in China and Asia, bridging between East and West for the 200 years it''s been in existence. And I think that role continues. In particularly the crypto space, most of you may know or may not, but a lot of the crypto companies were born here. A lot of the exchanges, the liquidity providers, what we see that''s global today kind of had its origins here. So there''s a natural inclination and DNA for sort of building and trying to bridge between East and West. And I guess as the entire industry has developed over the last 10 years, we''ve taken a very consistent approach. So I think people have seen what we''ve done on the regulatory side. So there is SFC regulation. There''s now HKMA regulation on stable coins. So a lot of that has been framework to allow for adoption. And I think Hong Kong''s particular role for China, not just in crypto, but overall, is that it''s one country, two systems. So we''re here to play that role, to be a sandbox maybe in some cases for China, but also be a conduit for sort of activity. And we''ll see a lot more of that in the years to come. Yeah. And I want to echo what Lawrence is saying. And in some sense, Hong Kong is the first city, I think, in the world that really trying to integrate blockchain as part of the society. You definitely don''t see even in America, there''s a lot of noise. But so far, it''s just tons of press conferences, but nothing realistic really happening yet. But it''s really, really exciting to see Yvonne actually here doing business in Hong Kong. I actually just don''t see that even in the U.S. But more importantly, this is the first cities actually have licenses for crypto exchanges, all the Bitcoin ETF, Ether ETF. This is the first city in Asia that even have it. So from an investor point of view, I think, I don''t know how many in the audience are investors. All investor want is really a city that actually, at least there''s no roadblock. So that there''s nothing sort of like surprises. So then founders can freely build in a city that they know that they don''t need to worry about it. Yeah. Sorry. Let me. We actually did some very good trials last year, you know, November, October. So there''s two user cases. One actually working with the idea. So we actually use the government-issued Chinese DID linked with the state coin wallet issued in Hong Kong on a public chain flair. Okay. China government ID, a state coin wallet on a public chain. The second user case is the Chinese legal, you know, identity ID with a digital asset issued by Franklin Tampen on Hydra. Those user cases, only you can do them in Hong Kong because there''s no way you can link a Chinese government ID directly to a crypto wallet. So through Hong Kong, make that whole thing happen. Interesting. So as an investor, like what do you look for in these projects? Like where is the investment narrative here? Because it''s a very interesting project for sure. But how would you market that and how would you get yield from that project as an investor? So Race Capital, we actually invest in people, technology. We''re not actually a pure crypto fund. We really focus on, actually I would say 99% of our hope for any sort of exit is IPO. So in that sense, what I''m looking for is, who knows, maybe you could be the deep seek of blockchain technology. And there''s so much surprises lately, particularly 2025. Wow. So I can''t imagine there''s talents coming from Hangzhou or Beijing or many, many other amazing cities in China. But yet it''s really the talent that we''re investing in. Frankly, I think that there''s tons of projects, particularly in the infrastructure side, have nothing to do with crypto. In fact, please don''t just create some sort of token project with useless use case. Because there''s tons of really amazing companies really don''t deserve a token at all. But what us as an early stage investor, at the end of the day, is really investing in great talent that really want to build some real use case. So the exit path is really not about launching a token or we sell the token. It''s really about working with enterprises of SaaS model and or licensing model to build a real business. Okay. Interesting. So speaking of talent, do you guys see around China, like talent leaving the major tech companies like Alibaba and Tencent and going towards startups? Because if I was a guy at Tencent and being well paid, would I really trust a crypto startup? Like is there that confidence that crypto is a big thing? You''ll want to leave your cushy job at Tencent to go work for a startup? I think these guys can, because literally they are hiring people. But from my point of view, I really, really appreciate sort of the BAT talents because they have seen how large systems work before. A lot of times when I talk to a founder, you have a great idea. But if you have never seen how, you know, how like large scale billions of people had deployed in your system before, it''s very hard just to have an idea. So we love the fact that there are experienced founders, particularly engineers, that come out from these, you know, bigger, the BAT of the world. So then we really have something to talk about because it''s hard to build infrastructure if you have never seen a big infrastructure, how it works. And of course, like here in China, the scale is immense, right? Like I can''t imagine how big the cloud deployment is for Alibaba or Tencent to serve the entire country. Huge. And so I guess those lessons about scale can translate well into blockchain infrastructure to help that scale out as well. Absolutely. But I think Lawrence can talk about how crypto projects, you know, attract people because we don''t do crypto. We do exactly like Tencent and Ali do. Infrastructure. And we pay like one third. So nobody come to us. Well, that''s too bad. That''s not a great hiring pitch. We pay one third of everyone else. I think also like back to your question, I was just going to make a comparison like what I see as some of the differences on on blockchain technology adoption. And I think in Asia and particularly in China, there''s a bit more B2B. Whereas like in the U.S. and maybe other places, it''s more of a direct to consumer model, like where the blockchain is being adopted. And in that case, then, to your point, we see a lot of talent flowing. It''s irregardless if it''s BAT or others. But, you know, people from Google spin out new businesses. Right. So I wouldn''t say that''s any different wherever you sit. Where there''s probably a little bit more tailwind is just the dynamics that''s happened domestically over the last couple of years. Globally, what''s changing and also to this point, Hong Kong has consistently started to deliver a safe framework for people to feel comfortable. And it''s, you know, 15 minute train ride to Shenzhen. So it''s pretty easy to come down here. Pretty easy for the rest of China to train or take a plane down to Hong Kong. And I think as we opened up over the last couple of years, look at this conference. Packed, sold out. Sold out. That''s right. Sold out. And the majority of the folks here are not from this region. So people come and it''s a melting pot. It''s like a mix, sort of an awesome opportunity for people to mix and to learn and to develop new concepts. So I''m super excited about that. Very cool. So going back to your stablecoin project, why does Hong Kong need a stablecoin? Why can''t we use USDC, USDT? Because isn''t the Hong Kong dollar itself a stablecoin? It''s paid to the US dollar. Yes. Conceptually, that makes it easier for, again, institutions who are our primary target users to understand the concept. I think it''s not so much about local usage. Aside from the fact that you may not be able to use digital money in taxis, we''re solving that. It''s going to happen in the next few months. Hurry up, please. I always say it''s a romantic thing. You have to use cash. Aside from that, I think stablecoins, particularly Hong Kong as a jurisdiction, is a global trade finance center. So third biggest financial center in the world. So as we see more assets, traditional assets being tokenized and digitized, then you will need a medium of exchange like a stable token. And also, another point back to kind of the panel, Hong Kong is the biggest offshore RMB hub. So if 60, 70% of the world''s trade is kind of with China or involves China, then you can imagine the amount of FX that has to go through a city like Hong Kong, a little bit less so Singapore and London. But these are the three main FX hubs. And we see that as a really a much bigger notional value compared to even the $100 billion that''s in Tether today. Oh, wow. Okay. So, you know, everyone thinks that Hong Kong''s crypto framework is the first step for mainland China to create a crypto framework. Because after all, Hong Kong had equities markets before mainland China and they just copy and pasted Hong Kong stuff. So do you guys see like mainland China looking down at Hong Kong and eventually legalizing crypto in some forms? What do you think? You want to start first? Is there a way to do this, right? Like, is there a way to do it through like, say, having the crypto ETFs in Hong Kong accessible to mainland China? Okay. So this is actually very sensitive. I only say this by my own opinion. Okay. So first, the thing about this, in China, there''s two systems for mainland visitors to buy and sell stock outside China. There''s QDI, so which means right now some Chinese investor comes through QDI, use RMB to buy U.S. ETF. Okay. That''s one channel. Second channel is Chinese investor with their local security firm. They can buy and sell Hong Kong stock through, they call Shanghai Hong Kong Connect and the Shenzhen Hong Kong Connect, which means the Chinese government build the channels, sediment channels directly to the Hong Kong stock exchange. And basically allow them to buy in RMB and sell in RMB. Remember, the most critical red line is capital inflow, outflow. Okay. That''s what government cares. If they have a system for you to sell and buy in RMB, you can never move money outside China. Then what''s the difference with Hong Kong regulated stock and Hong Kong regulated crypto? Okay. Okay. So why I really think right now the infrastructure is here, you know, with all the things. Technically, if the government say, okay, I will allow 200 million Chinese investors through their local security firm, use RMB to buy regulated crypto from a regulated Hong Kong crypto exchange. They can implement the whole thing in three months because all the settlements, all the channels, everything is already built. So also I see some signal from the financial regulators, you know, they begin to talk about, you know, Bitcoin, we need to pay more attention. We need to do more research around digital assets. So now actually I see there''s a possibility, you know, they open up the cryptos through Hong Kong regulated crypto exchange and open that to Chinese investors. There''s some possibility there. I mean, two years ago, if you ask me, I said zero. Okay. Now it''s actually become possible. Okay. So what you''re saying is you can''t actually buy Bitcoin from an exchange in China, but you can buy exposure to the Bitcoin ETF. No, it''s not ETF. Actually, they buy crypto directly, but it''s not like they''re holding by themselves. It''s like the security company in the middle actually holding for you. Okay. Okay. Then there''s a settlement between the Chinese security firms with the cryptos and, you know, that can say, and you basically buy through them. You don''t hold your keys. Yeah. You don''t hold your keys. Okay. Definitely. You cannot move the crypto outside China and sell it. You have the exposure to this vehicle, but without having the actual assets. Yes. But you can invest into it. That''s capital go-to crypto market. In the future. In the future. In the future. No, not right now. Hopefully. Do we have a timeline like, you know, next year, in two years, three years? I think really depends on Trump will become a permanent president or not. Well, he''s in the White House. He''s not leaving for four years. You know, let me put a very bold. I think more than 50% chance in three years. Okay. So if you''re on poly market, bet on that contract right now. His words, YOLO into it. But what about CBDCs? Like, do they have a role in all of this? Because CBDCs are not stable coins, but they have some kind of, like, stable coin-like attributes. Do you see that more in Hong Kong? Do you see that as part of, like, the blockchain push for China to get into Hong Kong? That should be a Hong Kong thing. Because right now, if you really talk about the CBDC and the stable coin, right now the ECNY technically is a stable coin. It''s not really the central, you know, central bank material currency because the liability for ECNY actually holds by the commercial banks. So that''s why actually it''s a little bit more stable coin than CBDC. And we think all three of them interact with each other, between CBDCs, stable coins, and deposit tokens. And actually, I wanted to add one more point to what Yifan was mentioning. And, again, this is a – some of the politicians from Hong Kong who represent Hong Kong in the National Congress, they are proposing to basically the central government to allow for what they would consider token connect. So the token connect would be, hopefully, let''s see the polymarket odds in three years'' time if there''s 50% chance that effectively a, you know, registered user in China could, through sort of this system, be able to get exposure. And this is no different from, to Yifan''s point, buying stocks, buying bonds, buying financial instruments globally. And this is not just a China thing. You need to understand how many countries in the world have a closed capital market. So actually, it''s already very – Explain that quickly for everyone in the audience. What does that mean? So it means that basically money – their money is restricted. It can''t flow in and out freely. So actually, around Asia, there are many countries that are like that. In the Middle East, there are certain countries that have that sort of same characteristic. So it''s not a China thing, right? It''s a – there''s a global phenomenon that certain countries are sensitive into outflows and inflows. So they need to monitor and manage sort of that capital account. Yeah. Yeah. So from an investor point of view, at the end of the day, particularly for the founders in the room, I think Chinese government in general have – always have a love-hate relationship going on with blockchain versus crypto. Right. Love the blockchain technology. But you definitely don''t want to see the crazy 2018 ICO hype or, in Chinese, the jiu cai. Like, which – no more cutting the chive. Right. So basically, the grandma sitting in the hotel and you – for ICO, that is not going to happen again. So at the end of the day, it''s really about protecting the 200 million retail investor. And of course, I think it would be great for the world if they all can come in and participate in the crypto market. But at the end of the day, that''s why a lot of founders should spend time in Hong Kong because we are playing in this city as a sandbox to anticipate this is going to happen. But we just need to keep in mind that it''s going to be step by step. It''s not literally – it''s not turned on the switch. It''s going to happen. Like a floodgate is – we really need to pay attention to the policy. And work with folks who are already actively practicing on the technology side of things. And slowly but surely, hopefully, when this floodgate opens, then all of us are ready for this. But then, like, what''s the upside for Beijing? Like, how would you sell this to them in the PBOC? You say, we know you don''t like crypto, but let''s allow some forms of it in mainland China. Like, what for them is the upside there? I think – not necessarily upside per se. It''s – at the end of the day, it''s all about making sure that none of us are going to get scammed, right? So KYC, AML, making sure that all the guardrail, so then, you know, we don''t all go crazy again. But at the same time, we do want all the retail investors to participate. Economy is a little meek right now. And there – we need to make sure that all the investors are actually continue to be excited about the economy. And we offer them different options to be able to trade. Yeah. It''s a simulogical why the Beijing allow investors to buy U.S. ETF and Hong Kong stock. Because, you know, the Chinese people love to save money. So they need a more diversified investment product to attract that money begin to flow. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. But then for Hong Kong stocks, it''s pretty obvious, right? You want capital from mainland China. It''s so large and big into the stock market here to help capitalize companies, right? But that''s not what crypto does. Yeah. I would disagree. I mean, I think kind of back to our point about B2B and certain innovation. So, for example, we also recently announced a partnership with a company called MicroConnect. So, MicroConnect, they basically do cash flow-based asset securitization, right? And essentially, it is technology that''s on-chain in Notion, but you cannot settle using crypto. But effectively, those are also native digital assets and a new asset class, so to say. So, I would say where there''s the innovation, you cannot stop, right? You need to kind of go with the flow. And it''s a sort of tooling to get to scale. And we see these digital native assets really being part of that blockchain finance ecosystem that we want Hong Kong to be. And not just Hong Kong, everywhere around the world. I think the bigger pie is blockchain finance compared to maybe Trump meme coin. Fair enough. Yes. I mean, I''m sure that Beijing looks at the Trump meme coin and says, we told you so, guys. This is what we don''t want to have. Just to wrap things up. So, what is a forecast you have for this year involving blockchain plus China? Let me start with you. Me? Any forecasts? Like, what do you think will happen this year? Any kind of goals or forecasts? I will pay close attention to the Bitcoin reserve that hopefully will happen in the U.S. And if that happens, I do think that it''s going to get many, many governments around the world to also think about potentially have their own. That would be super interesting for all of us. Okay. Do you think that they''ll have one in Beijing if D.C. does it first? I don''t know. This is a public pay grade. Okay. Fair enough. But I do think that it''s something that we should pay close attention to. Okay. Yifan? Yeah. I think the biggest thing for this year, China, Hong Kong, blockchain, it''s something we are working on. We are working with both governments trying to use the China real D.I.D. for Chinese mainland visitors to come to Hong Kong to do a lot of verification anonymously. Which means they can probably open some kind of account without exposing their personal information. So that probably, hopefully, in this year, it goes in production, not just sandbox. Okay. Interesting. And, Lauren, to get the last word of the panel. Offshore RMB stablecoin. Offshore RMB stablecoin. That''s a pretty bold bet. Yeah. That''s right. And why, though? Quickly, why do you think that would be a thing? Because I''m working on it. Oh, okay. Okay. Pump your own token, pump your own bag. All right, guys. That was good fun. Thanks for your time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.', 'All right.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('cmo_fireside__lightspark', 'CMO Fireside_ Lightspark', '未知講者', 'Fireside Chats', ' So, Christina, I would love, just for our audience, tell us your background prior, because it''s quite impressive. I wouldn''t say it was impressive, but first of all, it''s so brilliant to be here in Asia. There is so much energy and passion and excitement. We spent a lot of time in Latin America over the last year, and it''s matched or even surpassed here. So, me, I started at Amazon in 99. I''ve always worked on tech brands that people really didn''t understand, and they needed to be explained in detail to their user base. I''ve also been lucky enough to work at PayPal, which, of course, was changing payments and moving that forward. I was a messenger and then also part of the Libra project, which hit a few roadblocks along the way with the regulators, and went to Robinhood, where it was all about democratizing finance and changing the way that people invested. And then about two years ago, a group of us got together, and we started LightSpark, kind of finishing our unfinished business on Libra, and we''re trying to really change payments and make them more open and fluid for the world today. So, that''s in a nutshell. Great nutshell. So, when we spoke, I was just, again, I was impressed. I know you''re being very humble, but Amazon, PayPal, Robinhood, Facebook, I mean, you''ve done big tech, you''ve done big brand, and I was sort of interested in hearing what you think the similarities and differences are working in this new technology and how you have to think about that differently to build a brand in the crypto space. Such a good question. I think the first thing that I would say is there are more similarities and differences, but I think maybe the behaviors of the people in the industry is a little bit different. So, in technology, quite a lot of what you have to do is educate and build trust and build community. There''s no point building a long-lasting brand if there isn''t a utility and a little bit of consumer or user love, which we think is really important, and that applies to all tech brands, no matter what area they''re working in. I think in crypto, particularly, there has been, over the past, a sort of need or belief that you could make something orange and it would stand for a long-lasting brand, and I don''t think that''s the case at all. And so, one of the recommendations that we think about is how do we educate, how do we help people understand what they''re trying to do with the product, and more importantly, how do we build a community around it, and therefore, how do we engender trust? So, similarities but differences, but I think it''s the way in which the marketers have been, or maybe not even marketers, have been acting in this industry that have kind of changed, have to change a little bit more. I feel like I''m old enough to remember when Amazon first came out. It was a gray box, or a gray site with a single text box, and you could search for things, and then order, and you''re trusting that your credit card information was safe, and your product would get there. At the time, there was a lot of competitors. People don''t remember that, but there was a ton in the music business when you launched music, in the books business, and I think it became the power of the brand, right? Jeff and the team really did everything they could to say, this is what we''re about, and we are going to sell the world''s goods. So, when I think about what a brand stands for, I''m interested in how you look at LightSpark and say, what does this brand stand for? So, LightSpark. We really genuinely believe that money needs to change, and payments need to change. Candidly, all of us are using systems that were built in the 1970s. They''re older than all of us right now. And so, our mission is to enable money to move really freely, and to do that, we are really centered on educating, explaining, why people should care about using Lightning as the base layer. So, we built on Lightning because we think it is a great solution for people to send payments, but when we started working on it, it was very complicated and difficult for people to engage with. We''ve solved a lot of those problems, and we see huge advantages happening with people like Coinbase and Bitso, who are enabling their customers to send money using Lightning now. And we''re really very happy about that and quite proud of it because we''ve solved that solution. But we really believe there''s lots more to do, and we haven''t even seen all of the opportunities that we can do. LightSpark is also a B2B company, but it''s also a B2C company. We in crypto get, I would say, attacked a lot for making things overly complicated. So, how do you take a B2B2C company and make it easy enough to say, to our B2B partners, we do this, and our B2C partners, the general public, we do that. How is that as a marketing challenge? How does your brain take that apart? We''ve segmented down how we think about it. We address both our payments providers, the companies that work with us, developers who are using LightSpark to build on Lightning and creating some amazing solutions that have really genuinely never been seen before. And then also, we work with our partners to help them educate their customers about why using LightSpark makes payments more open, faster, cheaper, and also secure. And so, we''ve created workbooks and guidance that we send out to people. We''ve worked really closely with some great partners like CoinsPH in Asia to explain that. And, you know, I kind of think of it as a little bit like maybe in the future we''ll be like a visa. So, it''s something that''s trusted. You don''t necessarily have a direct consumer relationship with it because it''s issued by a bank, your card. I don''t think we''re going to sponsor the Olympics anytime soon, but I do think we will be the trusted brand. LightSpark will enable payments to run on Lightning, and that will make payments cheaper for everybody. So, you run on Lightning, which runs on Bitcoin. I believe Bitcoin is the biggest brand in crypto. Yeah. But there''s some amazing new brands coming up, whether you think of the Solano''s or Aptos''s, you know, all of the different folks building. Do you see an opportunity in the future for LightSpark to branch out to work across other chains? We''re laser focused on Bitcoin right now. We think it''s the most decentralized, most understood platform there is. We also think that there is an opportunity for people to do way more than they have done on it, and that''s one of the things that we''re trying to build. So, we are very Bitcoin-centered for sure. All right. So, payments to me is one of the most fascinating areas of crypto because it''s what needs disruption most. My partner and I got to Hong Kong, and the first thing we do is we''re like, we need cash to take a taxi. We go to the airport. They basically hit us for a 10% fee to exchange money there, which we go down the street, and we then get 10% more dollars. Right? So, simply for the convenience of needing cash at a moment, we had to pay a pretty big fee for that. How long do you think it takes before these types of payment rails that sort of are able to extract that friction out of the market are usable for all of us, so that I don''t have to think about when I go to Hong Kong or I go to Thailand or I go to India, that I have to now do all of this conversion in my head and really just be paying these taxes all along the way, because I just don''t know how to transfer money easily and simply in every location I''m at. Such a good question. Hong Kong taxis are my favorite taxis in the world. I just love them. They''re so cute and adorable. But I think one of the things that we really have thought hard about is how do we make money move more smoothly. And we shipped something earlier last year called UMA, which is universal money addresses, which is the ability to send money just like an email. And that means that I could be dollar sign Christina at my bank, my wallet. You could be dollar sign Sam. You and I can send money instantly to each other. There are about 300 million people who have access to UMA right now. But what''s interesting is that that could apply to sending money when you have to pay for a cab or when you might want to pay somebody you''ve met here for a meal or split a tab. All of those things are able to be done with UMA right now. And I actually think it''s happening. It''s just not known. With UMA, we see the network effects really beginning to kick in now. And we''re feeling that there is such a demand for a solution like that that we''re very excited about how people will begin to send money. So, UMA, the universal money address was the thing I got most excited when I read the information you sent. Because I do think that, you know, the idea that all of us have a unique identifier is that can be direct bank accounts between each other. When I spent some time recently with the Stellar Meridian team and we were talking about folks from Africa and Latin America where it''s like they''re used to paying 20% to 30% on their money in order to convert it. And the idea that to say to them, oh, well, I can just get your email address or I can get your UMA address and I can send you money directly, it stays in the currency you''ve sent it, right? Which also potentially is an inflationary currency versus a deflationary one. So, is that, you know, I guess are you building for first market worlds or are you building for the third world markets that really need a reimagination of payment systems? I think we''re building for both. But initially we saw a huge uptick for UMA in places like Latin America because you genuinely send money on the Bitcoin rails, but you can send it in your local currency. And it''s fast. Like right now you can send money between the U.S. and Mexico using UMA and it''s cheaper than anything else that exists. It''s faster. It uses real time payments. And that sort of reduces some of the issues with inflation on currency exchange. I, for people who live in the U.S. and perhaps in other countries, you have good banking systems in place. But that''s not the case for the rest of the world. And we know that people in different countries have been looking for solutions like this, but they haven''t really been able to find one yet. So, we''re really excited about UMA because we actually think it will change people''s lives in a way, which sounds sort of a little bit highfalutin. But genuinely, if you can send money faster than you used to be able to do, it will lift GDP eventually. And we''ve got great partners building on it and it''s very exciting to see. So, you mentioned earlier you worked at PayPal. Mm-hmm. PayPal, for me, did a very similar thing 20 plus years ago. Do you have that same sort of feeling in your gut as a brand marketer that says this could be the cusp of a real behavioral change to really free money up from a lot of these locked up systems and players? Completely. And look, I was at PayPal when we acquired Venmo. And even now, today, you can''t send money between Venmo and PayPal. That''s still a closed system. And what we''re building is something that''s like one step above, which is that open access for everybody. I think as a marketer, you have to think about what''s the balance between growth marketing and brand marketing and how do those pieces come together? And when do you start to pull the levers on growth or when do you start to really tell the story about what your brand has stood for? And that''s the balance. And you have to find the right place to do that. But, yeah, I''m super excited. I feel like I used to do it at Amazon where I spent five years telling everyone they were going to buy everything online. And people would just sort of laugh at me. And I kind of feel like that about what we''re doing right now. It''s very exciting. Right before you, we just said Farouk here. Farouk is, I would say, one of the most consistent, he hates the term, but I''ll say it, influencers in the crypto space. But also, you know, walks the walk. Asia has a ton of people who are really trying to translate why crypto to a very vast market in a lot of different languages. As a brand builder, especially in crypto, how do you assess the influence that these KOLs and influencers have on this ecosystem? Is it a net negative? Is it a net positive? How do you work with them? I think it''s fascinating. I think it''s probably a net positive. I think that you have to be really careful about the people that you put your brand with and how you talk about it. There has to be a level of trust that is delivered. And there also has to be a real belief from that influencer. I don''t think you can slap a badge on any influencer and just say, talk about us. That''s just not effective and not good marketing. What I do think is interesting, though, and we didn''t expect this, is that UMA, as an example, influencers in the U.S. who perhaps might be based in Brazil, they''re using UMA to actually run their businesses. And that''s something that we didn''t expect. So you can imagine that possibly in the future we may well be tapping into that, start to tell that piece of the story. I had the pleasure of interviewing Idris Elba, who''s helping in Ghana get the creator system on blockchain because he says these people, they''re not being given bank accounts. They''re not seen as valuable enough to give a bank account. So now he''s seeing there''s productions that are coming up where the DP and the cameraman and the sound guy are being paid all through direct payments on blockchain. And to me, it''s the use case that you guys really are bringing out to the world, which is pretty fascinating. We were in Nigeria just before the holidays and we had an event and we were expecting maybe 50 people to come. And there were about 120 people who turned up and they all wanted to use UMA. And we have influencers now who are down in Nigeria who are sending money between themselves. Also, one anecdotal story I heard was that people who travel with big bags of cash are now beginning to switch to UMA because it''s safer for them. And we think that that is something, again, which will be great if we can make it happen and make it be real. What''s the, we didn''t talk about this, but I''m just interested in the security protocol for UMA. How does one, you know, my name is public, so people could send something to me, but how do I make sure that my money stays my money? I mean, we have this situation in place where we''ll manage that. But also remember that we are providing the messaging system on the back of it. So that''s why it''s compliant with all the money transmittal rules that we have. And, you know, you will be working with your wallet or your bank who will also have their places, situation in place. Got it. Okay, running out of time, I want to ask you two more questions. The first is you run on Lightning, but you''re also creating your own Layer 2 blockchain called Spark. So tell us what the idea behind Spark is. Why did you feel like you needed your own Layer 2? So Spark is open source. It''s Layer 2. It runs on Bitcoin and Lightning. It came about because we were being asked by our customers for solutions for self-custody and Sablecoins. And so our engineers who are brilliant got to work and came up with a solution. It is built to be the most payment-centered Layer 2 that exists. It''s completely open source, as I said, and we''re rolling it out. So in the next couple of weeks, if you want to go to Spark.info, you''ll be able to find out more. And we''re really excited to see what developers will do on it because it addresses some of the problems that Lightning had. And we all know that stablecoins are moving at scale right now. And this enables people to settle stablecoins and not have the liquidity issues that they did on Bitcoin and Lightning. So Spark is specifically around payments and protocols on Bitcoin. I guess, how much is it, how much is stablecoin transaction built into that itself? People can use it to drive their stablecoin growth. And, you know, it''s just rolling out right now. We announced it just before the end of last year. And we''re super excited to see what people do. The team is really centered on bringing on developers and encouraging them to start to try to do new things. And we''re very excited to see what happens. All right. So just to sort of bring it full circle. Again, you worked at Amazon, at PayPal, at Robinhood, at Facebook. Now you''re at LightSpark. You are building, hopefully, the next great financial company in crypto, next great financial company, period. What learnings can you give those in the audience who might be starting brands from scratch today? From all of that experience to say, how would you go about building a crypto native brand if you were starting today? Such a brilliant question. And it''s so great to see so many people here. I think that understanding who your audience is and being true to that audience and not making it orange is probably a very good early direction. I also think that if you can balance the levers that we all have and be omnichannel, you also see better results. It''s not enough just to do growth marketing. You have to actually explain and have a true narrative that enables people to understand what your brand is standing for and understand how they can be part of it and how they can build with it. And this community, the crypto community, is one of the best communities for builders, I think. And with that comes innovation. And I think we see some of that being reflected in marketing right now. And for us, it''s still, we''re like a tiny percentage of our journey so far. So we''re really just beginning. But we want to do it with the community. And I think that''s something that I keep true to myself all the time. Like, what does it mean for the people who we want to use our products and services? You mentioned to me when we first spoke, which has still stayed in my mind since that conversation, you said, what are you solving for humans? Yeah. Because a lot of people seem to invent problems to then create solutions for them. But it sounds like your core is there is a need that people have. And if you can really just get to that layer and really make an easier experience for them, that''s how you win. Is that correct? I think so. And I think that as a brand, if you stay true to that inner truth and you don''t just sort of throw word soup out there of language or visuals that don''t mean anything and don''t demonstrate what you''re doing, you''re going to win. And that''s one of the greatest things that we all want to do as marketers is to win and to make sure that your company really does become a long-lasting brand. And that''s what we''re focused on at LightsBook. We want to make money move differently. And we really want to win. And we want to do it with everyone here. Thank you, Christina. Thank you, audience. We have another great session coming up right after this. Thank you. Such a treat to see you. You as well. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.', 'So, Christina, I would love, just for our audience, tell us your background prior, because it''s quite impressive.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('d55486d7ef', 'CMO Fireside: Lightspark', '待定', 'Fireside Chats', ' So, Christina, I would love, just for our audience, tell us your background prior, because it''s quite impressive. I wouldn''t say it was impressive, but first of all, it''s so brilliant to be here in Asia. There is so much energy and passion and excitement. We spent a lot of time in Latin America over the last year, and it''s matched or even surpassed here. So, me, I started at Amazon in 99. I''ve always worked on tech brands that people really didn''t understand, and they needed to be explained in detail to their user base. I''ve also been lucky enough to work at PayPal, which, of course, was changing payments and moving that forward. I was a messenger and then also part of the Libra project, which hit a few roadblocks along the way with the regulators, and went to Robinhood, where it was all about democratizing finance and changing the way that people invested. And then about two years ago, a group of us got together, and we started LightSpark, kind of finishing our unfinished business on Libra, and we''re trying to really change payments and make them more open and fluid for the world today. So, that''s in a nutshell. Great nutshell. So, when we spoke, I was just, again, I was impressed. I know you''re being very humble, but Amazon, PayPal, Robinhood, Facebook, I mean, you''ve done big tech, you''ve done big brand, and I was sort of interested in hearing what you think the similarities and differences are working in this new technology and how you have to think about that differently to build a brand in the crypto space. Such a good question. I think the first thing that I would say is there are more similarities and differences, but I think maybe the behaviors of the people in the industry is a little bit different. So, in technology, quite a lot of what you have to do is educate and build trust and build community. There''s no point building a long-lasting brand if there isn''t a utility and a little bit of consumer or user love, which we think is really important, and that applies to all tech brands, no matter what area they''re working in. I think in crypto, particularly, there has been, over the past, a sort of need or belief that you could make something orange and it would stand for a long-lasting brand, and I don''t think that''s the case at all. And so, one of the recommendations that we think about is how do we educate, how do we help people understand what they''re trying to do with the product, and more importantly, how do we build a community around it, and therefore, how do we engender trust? So, similarities but differences, but I think it''s the way in which the marketers have been, or maybe not even marketers, have been acting in this industry that have kind of changed, have to change a little bit more. I feel like I''m old enough to remember when Amazon first came out. It was a gray box, or a gray site with a single text box, and you could search for things, and then order, and you''re trusting that your credit card information was safe, and your product would get there. At the time, there was a lot of competitors. People don''t remember that, but there was a ton in the music business when you launched music, in the books business, and I think it became the power of the brand, right? Jeff and the team really did everything they could to say, this is what we''re about, and we are going to sell the world''s goods. So, when I think about what a brand stands for, I''m interested in how you look at LightSpark and say, what does this brand stand for? So, LightSpark. We really genuinely believe that money needs to change, and payments need to change. Candidly, all of us are using systems that were built in the 1970s. They''re older than all of us right now. And so, our mission is to enable money to move really freely, and to do that, we are really centered on educating, explaining, why people should care about using Lightning as the base layer. So, we built on Lightning because we think it is a great solution for people to send payments, but when we started working on it, it was very complicated and difficult for people to engage with. We''ve solved a lot of those problems, and we see huge advantages happening with people like Coinbase and Bitso, who are enabling their customers to send money using Lightning now. And we''re really very happy about that and quite proud of it because we''ve solved that solution. But we really believe there''s lots more to do, and we haven''t even seen all of the opportunities that we can do. LightSpark is also a B2B company, but it''s also a B2C company. We in crypto get, I would say, attacked a lot for making things overly complicated. So, how do you take a B2B2C company and make it easy enough to say, to our B2B partners, we do this, and our B2C partners, the general public, we do that. How is that as a marketing challenge? How does your brain take that apart? We''ve segmented down how we think about it. We address both our payments providers, the companies that work with us, developers who are using LightSpark to build on Lightning and creating some amazing solutions that have really genuinely never been seen before. And then also, we work with our partners to help them educate their customers about why using LightSpark makes payments more open, faster, cheaper, and also secure. And so, we''ve created workbooks and guidance that we send out to people. We''ve worked really closely with some great partners like CoinsPH in Asia to explain that. And, you know, I kind of think of it as a little bit like maybe in the future we''ll be like a visa. So, it''s something that''s trusted. You don''t necessarily have a direct consumer relationship with it because it''s issued by a bank, your card. I don''t think we''re going to sponsor the Olympics anytime soon, but I do think we will be the trusted brand. LightSpark will enable payments to run on Lightning, and that will make payments cheaper for everybody. So, you run on Lightning, which runs on Bitcoin. I believe Bitcoin is the biggest brand in crypto. Yeah. But there''s some amazing new brands coming up, whether you think of the Solano''s or Aptos''s, you know, all of the different folks building. Do you see an opportunity in the future for LightSpark to branch out to work across other chains? We''re laser focused on Bitcoin right now. We think it''s the most decentralized, most understood platform there is. We also think that there is an opportunity for people to do way more than they have done on it, and that''s one of the things that we''re trying to build. So, we are very Bitcoin-centered for sure. All right. So, payments to me is one of the most fascinating areas of crypto because it''s what needs disruption most.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('data_is_the_new_oil', 'Data is the New Oil', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' It''s fantastic to be here. And we have almost everybody that we''re supposed to. I think we''re going to have Philip join us pretty soon. But first, I want to thank our panelists for being here. We''ve got Mark from Nier, Anna from Open Data Labs, which is the company behind Vana, and of course, Magnus from Blocksense. And I guess anybody who''s got an NFT profile is just sort of like an abstract instantiation of a concept of a human being. I''m Lex. I''m a partner at Generative Ventures. We invest in crypto AI, machine economy, and Deepen. So I''m really excited about this conversation. We''re going to focus on the data layer in crypto AI and much more broadly. But maybe we''ll just start with introductions. So Mark, what''s Nier? And what do you do there? Hello, everyone. My name is Mark Mee. I''m the head of partner development, VC, and investment relations. Nier is the blockchain for AI. So we started out as a blockchain layer, a highly scalable focus on sharding layer one. And now one of the most active with currently 37 million monthly active users. And moving with the chain extraction to really unify the liquidity as well as all of the chains together. And lastly is the long-term vision of really connecting everyone and allowing them to be user-owned and controlled AI. Right. And we''d love to kind of discuss more on how data really focus upon that. Within my role, I kind of lead a lot of our partner development and talking with various verticals within partnerships, as well as kind of our VC and investment side, as well as our whole VC network. So really connect with all the VCs like yourself and what is coming up within our ecosystem, as well as from the protocol and Nier itself from that perspective. Great. Thank you. I feel very connected right now. Well done. Anna. Yeah. I''m Anna from VANA. So VANA is, from a technical perspective, it''s like an L1 that can work with private data. Usually blockchains don''t really work well with private data because then it''s public and then you can''t charge money for it or kind of permissionlessly or permission access. In terms of the goal of VANA, it''s really about building a self-sovereign data ecosystem where users own their data, can bring it with them across applications, can grant access to train AI models on it, and where developers can access really high-quality data sets. Because a lot of the data that you need to train AI on today is sitting inside walled gardens of big tech and not necessarily available. You might know VANA through different data DAOs that exist on the platform. So there''s like the Reddit data DAO, there''s a LinkedIn data DAO, a Twitter data DAO. All of these different projects are essentially onboarding data in an interoperable way to VANA and allowing for AI researchers to essentially train models across these different data sets. Awesome. Magnus. Hey, everybody. Magnus from Blocksense. We''re a decentralized Oracle network. We just came out of A16Z''s crypto accelerator last fall and are currently on 30-plus EVM networks with the first mainnet launches coming imminently. So what we do, what makes us a little different, so we''re actually a programmable Oracle network. We''re secured through ZK roll-up architecture as well as shared security through restaking and a modular programmable SDK. What that all means, what all that jargon kind of means together, is that we enable any builder to bring any kind of real-world data or even compute on-chain in a verifiable way. So moving beyond purely just like DeFi price feeds all the way to things like AI compute, like GPU, even CPU tasks, all of that can be kind of permissionlessly brought on-chain with the verifiability brought on by the ZK architecture. I feel like we''ve minted the NFT. That was great timing, by the way. Yeah, yeah, it''s great. You''re just in time. We''re all friends already. Philip, what do you do? And what''s your project about? Sure. Pleasure. Thanks for having us. And sorry for the multiple delay. I''m co-founder and CEO of Cookie Free and contributor to the Cookie ecosystem. We are building a data layer for AI, LLMs, agents, as well as businesses. So you can think of us as an aggregation engine for sourcing the data from both off-chain world and on-chain world for either business intelligence that helps companies to optimize their spendings to actually understand their users from where they are coming from, what are the conversion events they are conducting, what is the overall business situation from the data standpoint, as well as for the investors. We are providing insights, like kind of an alpha, intersecting social data like Mindshare as well as on-chain. So we are the creators of Cookie.fun, among other products, which is the probably biggest distribution channel for discovering AI agent tokens. So yeah, happy to join the discussion. Fantastic. So we''ve got 40 minutes, which means we''re going to go real slow and basic across everything. And, you know, everybody mentioned the word data and said words about the word data and sort of like the words all kind of sound the same. But at the same time, the projects are all really different. Like there''s completely different value chains and different things that you do. So can we disambiguate the word data in the first place and then maybe we can split out like financial and behavioral and like different industry sectors that you focus on because otherwise it''s all a bit of a clump. So, Anna, maybe we start with you because like let''s say I''m Sam Altman, you know, that''s, you went to Y Combinator. I don''t know if that''s how Sam Altman runs Y Combinator. Don''t you just like download the internet? With some bots and then you have all the data? Like what is data? What are you actually talking about? Yeah, great question. So you''re kind of right in terms of how it works today. Like you basically just take the whole public internet, all the data that''s publicly available. It''s like an NFT, right? Click save as. Maybe. I''m not sure. Yeah. I think that, yeah, so you can look at all the data that''s publicly available today. The data set, there''s like common crawl and then there''s a higher quality subset of it called FineWeb. That data set is around 15 trillion words, which is a huge amount of information, right? I don''t know if humans ever like consume that much, but the leading AI models are now trained on that much data, right? So like Lama 3 is trained on 15 trillion words. If we want to make AI better and continue to scale it, we need to find a place to get more data. So I guess to your question directly, yes, you can try to download the whole public internet, but we''ve already done that as an AI industry. And so then the question becomes, where do you get more data, right? And a lot of that data is sitting inside of the walled gardens of big tech, right? So a lot of the data, say, sits on like Twitter, which you can''t necessarily scrape. Maybe there are ways of scraping it. Google Docs data, right? Your email data, your iMessage data. So the way that big tech companies today and kind of leading AI labs get this data is they typically buy it from data collection companies or directly from companies, right? So Reddit earns $200 million selling data directly for AI training. And then there''s this big industry that''s relatively quiet, which is called kind of data collection. Appin is one of the big players. My co-founder used to work there kind of selling data to big tech. And some of the leading big tech companies have like hundreds of millions or even a billion dollar contract buying a ton of data. What they do is essentially a company comes in and says, hey, I want to buy iMessage data. Apple''s not going to sell iMessage data. So then this company is like, okay, I''m going to go find 10,000 people who will export their iMessage data, put it into this pool, and then I can sell it back to that company. So yeah, I guess that is kind of how data markets work today. But like, if you''ve got a trillion, gazillion words already on the internet, like isn''t it a drop in the bucket what I have in my Google Docs? Like why does the, why care? Why does it even matter to get this like private stuff when you''ve got all so much already? Yeah. So if you look at the ratio of how much of the public internet, how much of the internet is publicly scrapeable, it''s actually less than 0.1%. So all of that public stuff represents an extremely like small portion of the overall data. And if you want to make AI models better and kind of continue the scaling law with both compute and data, you need some place to get that data. There are other approaches you can try to take, right? So like synthetic data is one workaround that people have been trying. Because it''s so hard and expensive to get the data, right? So DeepSeek did this where what they did is instead of getting a ton of data, they started with a smaller amount of really high quality data. They actually hired a bunch of like PhDs to generate like math equations and coding and stuff like that and use that to then generate synthetic data. But that only works to some extent, right? From an AI perspective, the ideal case is like you could query any data from all these different walled gardens. So it''s extremely high quality and there''s a ton of it available. But that''s very hard to do in practice, right? And so, and the incentives aren''t really designed that way because of the walled gardens. Yep. I think that''s a super valuable thing to open up and I appreciate it. I guess question to Philippe and Magnus. what''s the difference between that, meaning the entire internet and all of your personal text messages, and the types of data that you''re working with? Like, are we gonna shove Reddit into a verifiable TE Oracle? You know, are you selling to enterprises TikTok comments? Like, what kind of data are you working on? Yeah, I could start there. Like, so I''ll just zoom out a second. I wanna take a little bit of issue with the title of this panel, which is data is the new oil, right? I think it''s a somewhat hackneyed phrase that people have been saying since probably the 90s. If it is oil, it''s not new, but it also is not oil, right? It''s not a commodity. Also, it''s not data, and this isn''t a panel. It''s a hallucination. Reality is fake. Don''t buy mean points. You knew where I was going, didn''t you? No, so data is not a commodity. There''s lots of different types of data. Even when it comes to personal data, you have self-attested personal data, which has a certain level of reliability. Then you have third-party attested data. It could be signed. It could not be signed, right? You know, to call data oil, I think, is a little bit of a misnomer. But at Block Sense, you know, so we''re kind of opening it up to builders to decide what sort of data needs to be on-chain. And for sure, not all types of data should be on-chain, right? When you''re talking about personally identifiable information, bank account details, things like that, it''s actually illegal to put that on-chain, right? It breaks GDPR. But just looking, you know, taking a step back and looking where the demand is that we see for oracles, like data oracles today, it''s pretty much all in DeFi, right? That''s sort of 99.9% of the use or usefulness of data on-chain today is for your lending protocols, for your perpetuals, DEXs, for your prediction markets, right? Now, that''s essentially like a lot of work that gets done to bring some information on-chain that''s actually available for free via APIs, right? The CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko APIs are freely available, but, you know, chains are willing to pay, you know, like six figures, sometimes up to millions of dollars to actually get this data on-chain. It shows you some of the difficulty that is involved with actually bringing that freely available information on-chain in a trust-minimized way, right? So it''s all the kind of operating costs and so on. I think, like, as an industry, that is sort of where we are today, and some of that rent-seeking behavior really has to stop, and Bloxens is trying to enable that by not charging integration fees and the like. But what I would really like to see is much more diversity of use cases and applications on-chain that require data, right? So this is where you''re kind of, like, decentralized compute, but not even just computation, things like, you know, like weather data, right? So if you have on-chain insurance, this is actually one of our ecosystem projects is building this out. It''s like, you know, can you settle insurance claims for the agriculture sector using weather data? You know, did it rain? Was there a drought? This sort of thing. You know, that''s just, like, one very narrow use case, but I think it paints the picture of, you know, like, how we can go beyond just price feeds being sort of what oracles provide and actually, like, expanding the pie. Yeah, so quite two different and distinct things that data there means. I think there''s actually an interesting analogy. So, you know, in the case of Vana, it''s about as much unstructured data as possible in order to put it into, you know, a training process to create AI models, right? So, like, there''s a big math box and you''re trying to shove data in it, but the data that you''re trying to shove is basically the exhaust of all human experience, structured, unstructured, everything. One note, data on Vana is structured by the data DAO and verified. Just one thing. So, yeah, you do need the structure so that you understand kind of the quality and what you''re consuming, but the general principle. Yes, but, like, text you can pull in, right? Yeah. Whereas in the other case, the amount of data is maybe one millionth or one trillionth the amount that you would go in the AI world, and it''s quantitative, it''s deterministic, right? And it gets fed into the financial infrastructure of crypto in order to do computation and then structure DeFi products. So you have almost, there''s an analogy there that, like, the ingestion mechanism is actually quite difficult and expensive. So let''s switch to Mark and Philip. Maybe, like, now that we''re talking about what kinds of things you can bring on-chain, what''s the next step, like, in the value generation or the supply chain of the sector? Like, okay, now we''ve sucked in some structured data. We''ve sucked in qualitative stuff for these different use cases. Like, what do you see actually happening on-chain with it? So I actually think this is where this data is a new oil, kind of what you were talking about in terms of the statement. I think it''s quite interesting, right? Because if you actually break down what oil actually means or what it has been utilized as... It''s dinosaur juice. Exactly, right? Well, I mean, outside of it, you go to the next steps, and then you can process it, or it could be utilized for machinery, utilized to power vehicles, obviously, for heat, right? I mean, and so to me, that''s exactly what they have just been describing in terms of the different use cases and applications and depending on how they modify or work through that oil, right? To make that work. And here it''s the data, right? And so I would say Nier for us is really then focus on maybe the connective tissue to utilize it from the earlier stage, then processing of executing transactions, cross-chain transactions, and helps of executing and utilizing the oracles to make different swaps and trades. So one interesting product that we recently launched was called Nier Intense, which enables basically cross-chain swaps natively, and it''s done in a way where it allows access to previous maybe not accessible assets, such as Bitcoin, Ripple, Doge. We were able to integrate BearChain on the first day when they launched, and you''re able to swap between your Nier or Solana or ETH or anything like that to power that, right? And it''s utilizing feeds, it''s utilizing the data from that, but then you''re able to execute on that point. And so I think that''s one aspect of kind of our chain attraction point, but in the future, in terms of the user-owned and controlled AI side, I think it''s really important to have the right models, right? Which all of these, you know, they''re feeding that to really build. You''re constantly training to figure out where to utilize these swaps and models, I think, which is kind of what Philip was mentioning in terms of being that dashboard and highlighting the different types of agents to utilize from that standpoint. So I guess short in terms of the data aspect, it''s really wide and spread depending on the use case and the specific points of action. It could be very niche, it could be very general. Yeah. And so one aspect that we''re working on, for example, is kind of a, you know, AI assistant, right? To help you execute specific actions, and it could just, it doesn''t need to be within Web3 or crypto, but it could be something from your fiat on-ramp to buy something from Amazon or, you know, that''s the vision that we all think will happen in the future, right? Comparing your Web2 side to our future Web3 side, right? Or the future agent-to-agent execution side. So I think there''s a lot of direction that we can really bring this discussion, but I guess it really depends on what''s most exciting and what''s applicable to maybe the panel as well as the crowd. Yeah, I think you''re being a bit modest. I think Nier has been fantastic in kind of investing across the supply chain in crypto AI, in addition to sort of these more structured trading examples that you''ve talked about. So on Cookie and where you sit, I think it''s really, you touch both sides, right? In the sense that you have products that are like quantitative information analytics products, right? That are sort of like in the Oracle world, and then you''re also tracking these agents which are largely built on large language models, right? Which are what we talked about, the thing that you train with the download of the internet. Can you talk a bit about maybe just the recent history of like how you saw the rise of these conversational AI agents and how you started thinking about tracking them and like the financialization that happened over the last six months? Yeah, sure. So I would say like the AI agents is nothing new, specifically like in Web2 at least. It''s something new that we discovered in this like crypto bubble recently. So like giants that are in this like traditional markets are building and working with agents for months or even probably already years. And I think this is good that we discovered it finally in crypto and it kicked off some small trend, hopefully a long-term one. But I think like obviously it''s very exciting that we have this intersection of blockchain execution and AI agents that can be autonomous and can do transactions for humans. My personal view on that is that this is this ultimate UX layer that is required for this legendary adoption, mainstream adoption to happen in crypto because like blockchain is not designed to be used by humans. It is designed to be used by the agents that will execute the transactions for the humans. Like it''s too complicated for us to double check every transaction, pay the gas fee, double check every smart contract we''d like to interact with, cross breach, understand what''s going, like understand the backend. Right now the web tree is the UX layer is that you are interacting directly with the backend. Whereas agents are providing finally the possibility of actually not taking care about anything what''s happening on backend but just like clicking the button, making the, letting the agent do something for you. and this goes for both, applies for the intelligence layer. So like the idea what you would like to actually execute on chain and then the execution itself. So I would say the thing that we are right now looking at with the big excitement is that we believe that those data that we are right now processing are still to be processed because as an example, if you are having any like data sets of on-chain and off-chain transactions, you can, let''s say, calculate the mind share on the social side and on the on-chain side you can calculate the volumes and market caps. And even this simple ratio like mind share versus market cap gives us a lot of alpha from which all of like our users are using on a daily basis. And only if you label specific tokens with this ratio then LLM can actually utilize it because without calculating it, labeling specific entity with this outcome, it''s like impossible with this computing power to like process everything every time. So I think like we need a lot a lot of like labeling so process data that can be understandable for LLMs so just to like make it more straightforward for the LLM to connect the dots and find for example correlations they have to work with the process data not the raw data and I think this is what we need to do in terms of like big effort to be done still and what''s exciting about that is that not only humans will be coming up with the ideas of those labels but also the agents themselves they can come up with some idea okay maybe let''s find the smart money that was very early with AI agents let''s compare it to some other moves on chain and let''s start labeling those wallets let''s see what is the correlation with some social sentiment that was around that and so on and so forth I think there are like plenty of things that are still to be discovered from this like digging deeper and deeper right now the computing power actually limits us in that terms but labels make this like easier for LLMs to process that and like I''m talking about labels as an example of course but this is how we are right now looking at it we think that there are like there is a much more alpha to be discovered still we don''t we do not know nothing right now comparing to what we will know probably in a few years once those data will be processed and we will discover so many correlations that probably the agents will be the only users of the blockchain capable of maybe running some complex strategies because they will be too complex for humans I think we''re all discovering right now the correlations between Libra and Melania and about 90 other projects in the space and so that''s going to be my who here has traded meme coins how many how many of you have made money on it net net pnl net pnl god bless you sir let''s whoever can call the department of justice it''s that guy right there I''m just kidding but oh man okay so you know just like the market backdrop is that there was this huge boom in crypto AI infrastructure in March of last year that went up that went down and then people discovered AI agent coins with virtuals and some other things around it that has gone up and has gone down in large part because of the connection to kind of stuff on Solana and the meme coin controversies with Kelsier and so on I think there are profound long term trends going on right so like these market bubbles or like speculation moments are really things that will pass as the secular adoption of the technologies that we''re talking about increases but we it is painful it is super painful for people obviously who participate and as an investor I have to figure out what''s the real commercialization model here and so Philip I want to kind of go backwards probably from you as well you know one simple mental model is there''s manufacturing of stuff and there''s distribution of stuff right and so crypto is good at manufacturing financial products like the banking industry was before the big open AI company the big tech companies like open AI are very good at manufacturing foundation models which are kind of the core the core intelligence of the AI sector and then agents are a productization that distributes those things right so you you talked about being able to access trades or if we plug in agents to oracles or if we give them new skill sets because they have your private data and they live on your phone whatever it is agents are a way to distribute that so we kind of know the value chain a little bit but we don''t have a great sense of how these things get commercialized and so I want to go back to the recent AI agent market moment to ask like what do you think of the financialization that we saw like is it the right thing for agents to have a liquid token supply and for that thing to be the main way that they''re traded you know is the ownership model of agents do you think correct like should we be pump funding tool you know like these pools and that''s that''s the way you hold an agent is the way for agents to make money to take a share of trading fees or should it be payments you know you''ve spent a lot of time kind of staring at social media attention that is kind of a proxy for the value capture or that that these agents generate but surely you must think you must also think about like what these things are worth so can we start there and then we''ll kind of back solve into what other crypto AI stuff should be should be worth in the long run sure sure thank you yeah so basically as you said like the attention is currency that was the like foundation idea of running cookie.fun to like provide it in a very useful way for people so they can understand how much attention specific agents are actually covering among like crypto Twitter how do they actually get the attention can you just quick side yeah so basically they are active on Twitter and this is like applicable for probably 95% of them so they are getting attention on Twitter and they are providing something valuable theoretically AIXBT is probably the best example to refer to which became like probably one of the most known crypto KIO worldwide thanks to providing alpha thanks to providing very summarized information and intelligence basing on different data he is built on and I think this is pretty interesting business model because they have like AIXBT has this token gate terminal with even more alpha and like customizable alpha that you can ask for and he will provide you even like some reports about that just to kind of slow you down because I don''t know if everybody is following like not because you''re not explaining it because it''s complicated so the agent is sucking in data or like text from a bunch of Twitter accounts yes there''s a set of Twitter accounts that about 400 I guess how much 400 Twitter accounts that generates market views whether or not those are good market views is a question mark you know in traditional finance you''d have equity research right so you generate the market views then the agent is sucking in the data because data is not the new oil and then it''s trained on it or it''s tuned on it and then it can output a up-to-date market view when you talk to it yeah and the market values that a lot almost one bill I guess at the peak so if you have a token of like AIXBT you can access their terminal to access like even more data and like more insights generally and more intelligence you can ask about anything so this is like one approach I would say generally in terms of tokenization and value transaction in crypto I think again that the blockchain is just a perfect environment for the agents to transact between each other not specifically to like monetize them but like to transact the value because they cannot do it easily in web 2 there are no rails for doing it agents cannot have any identity so actually they are out of the bank system whereas in web 3 they can have multiple wallets and they can manage them and this is I think a very exciting point to actually rise in terms of the monetization we will see those implementations that probably different agents will be approaching differently but having this foundation that they can do anything with owning any token they can create some vaults some staking strategies they can even provide some its own solutions for example with different tokens that they have so right now I would say most of those tokens are not required and not necessarily needed for those agents but I believe that in the future we will discover many use cases where those tokens will be useful and will be just a transaction value and currency between those agents so they can exchange between each other and so on Ben how much of this story do you align with and which do you think will in what order do you think this will happen oh sorry Mark okay yeah you said Ben no no so I think it''s pretty interesting because everything we just discussed right now the specific agent use case was very novel right and very highlighted on that you know scraping let''s say Twitter for financial transactions and flow and I thought it was interesting you know one example you said earlier which was oh yeah eventually maybe these tokens will have value and kind of swapping it definitely reminds me of you just swap token with let''s say NFT and it''s kind of the same in terms of what we imagined about a few years ago right and so I think it''s pretty clear just from a market standpoint that currently you know agent and how their utilizations and where they are now is still very early and we''re developing and trying to improve the overall use cases which is why we need better data better different identifications of how they''re structured and labeled and really I mean this is kind of the difference between us having a proof of concept with a very strong let''s say large language model that ChatGPT built or that''s utilized from that but then now let''s get into the weeds of specific use cases so to me what I''m really interested and excited on a personal level is really seeing these businesses really have that application and developing that model with all their own their data and being able to really apply this extract that value with the agents to help them execute to help them really develop some of these efficiencies that we all envision can happen right and so you guys see a lot of different companies in this value chain how skilled do you think the agents become and on what time frame I think the time frame front it''s really interesting because if you even just say blockchain people from the trad fi or you know institutional side they will say it''s still early like we''re still proving that there''s utilization and use cases right I thought it was interesting earlier Philip said that oh yeah block chains meant you know for utilization of AI or agents for that development but in reality I mean it''s a ledger right like it would be good to put your real estate on there because you need to know who owns what and it''s transparent it can''t be changed right there''s specific use cases for each tech but the question is is it worth it to change right and so you see so much tech currently in not innovative spaces in banking in aerospace with airlines not updating their 1970s tech and still having that issue right and so I think within the next you know six months you''ll see quick developments within the AI models and efficiencies and there''s going to be maybe new more efficient novel use cases but kind of at a scale like probably not but that''s why we''re really excited about near being highly scalable and really being able to support and the connective tissue to really help execute every aspect of that as they improve their products and have better data they need to have better models and you need to execute more cross-chain transactions maybe from fiat to any other asset any new asset and being able on the back end to power all that and support that is really what we''re about and why when we say near is a blockchain for AI it''s kind of confusing because what does that even mean but then once you go in deeper the whole idea is having that infra and that AI piece to connect everything to connect the on and off ramps across different chains and really support and validate all of that so that''s what we''re really excited about and a lot of announcements coming up within the next few weeks and so happy to share more cool we''re coming up on time but I want to give Magnus and Anna kind of the closing word on these commercial models and monetization you know and like do we need tokens for this stuff or is the nectar of speculation just too delicious to put down I''m feeling moody a little bit maybe Magnus how do you think about the commercialization of the data on your side and then Anna take us home after that yeah I''ll talk about how we think about it at Blocksense in a minute first I just want to give a perspective on the agent landscape generally so I think commercialization slash monetization and financialization are two not necessarily 100% overlapping things and what I mean by that is you could financialize an agent and a lot of the crypto agents out today they''re essentially that right it''s an agent with a meme coin attached and the financialization there is just like the mind share like the attention that that agent is getting but it doesn''t necessarily tie to the utility of the agent versus commercialization I think some of the projects that are looking a bit further afield further in the future are actually looking to build or like have frameworks out there that allow people to build agents that generate utility themselves right so they actually generate revenues they have control over their own wallets and they are able to interact on chain in such a way that they can build their own revenues and then the commercialization there would be potentially a model that looks more like a sharing of the revenue or dividends or something like kind of more closely approximating how business everywhere outside of crypto works which is like you try to generate cash flows and then you know the investors in your project kind of hopefully get rewarded for let''s create real economic value Anna last word yeah I guess in terms of like the core economics it''s really about how do you turn data into an asset class that actually is like revenue generating right and so that can either be by selling data directly to web to AI companies right or it can be by tokenizing an AI model right so I think one good example that actually shows the full flow of value is the Reddit data DAO which has 140,000 users who kind of contributed their data there''s a Google brain ML engineer who came in and was like hey I want to train a model on this data he didn''t want to directly buy the data and instead was like I''m going to give you ownership of the model so every time the model is used the data contributors actually get paid out right in the case of that he trained a model that was just good at shitposting because it''s Reddit data right so quite early but if you compare it to like open AI like they''re doing three four billion dollars in revenue from having the best AI model so I think that''s sort of the model of economics that I expect to play out in kind of crypto AI in the next two or three years I''d say fantastic thank you so much I think the perspectives were really broad and different and I''m glad that we were able to open up these themes because it is a pretty profound moment I''ve said this in a previous session before but I think like financial nihilism is a poison in our industry we have a moment to marry crypto with AI AI is going to be the biggest driver of economic activity in the next 10-15 years and so we have like this moment to be the money financial rails and the economic incentive rails for the world to do this in an open source way it is completely up to us to fuck it up and we''re doing a pretty good job as an industry of getting there but you know companies and projects like the ones on this stage are doing real work and so I just want to express thanks to the entrepreneurs that are taking real risk and for people to continue to be interested in this topic and pushing it forward so thank you thank you thank you everyone for being out I have to see you I have to see you I have to find out in this I

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('welcome_to_the_web3_art__culture_summit', 'Welcome To The Web3 Art & Culture Summit', '未知講者', '未分類', ' Welcome to the first ever Consensus Hong Kong. We''re very excited to be here. Farouk and I are very happy to be involved with the Web3 Summit, the Art and Culture Summit. We have some amazing sessions coming. Farouk, you''ve been spending a lot of time in Hong Kong. Yeah. What do you love about this city? It''s electric. I mean, this is like my home away from home. Honestly, I got my second home. I love it here. I landed in Hong Kong. I was happy as ever. It''s just the energy here is amazing. And what I always say is that crypto does not feel like the future in Hong Kong. It feels like the present. It''s just another thing, you know? It''s absolutely wonderful. We have almost 8,000 people here today. 8,000? 8,000 people. So we want to thank everyone in our audience watching us on the live streams. You and I were talking backstage. You were talking about what you think is next in crypto. So why don''t you tell us the sort of categories you''re paying attention to as an entrepreneur, as someone who just really has his pulse on the heartbeat of the blockchain. What are the things that are getting you excited? Apps. Honestly. Too many chains, too little apps. Right? Everybody''s launching blockchain. I talk to people, yeah, I''m dropping this L1, L2. I''m like, dude, I don''t... Respectfully, I don''t care. Yeah. You know, like there''s a lot of great work in blockchains. Ethereum is perfect when you think about it. It''s L1, L2, L3, whatever. Solana''s great. Sui, all these chains are great. But nobody''s working on building actual applications on these blockchains. So for us, we''re at Myriad. That''s what we do best, right? But I think that there''s so much appetite for using crypto, but there''s so little appetite for building actually sustainable tools within crypto. And that''s something that really frustrates me sometimes, but I really think that apps are really the future blockchains. When you talk about apps, I mean, you guys have an amazing prediction market. There''s a lot of folks here, and especially who will be on stage today, talking about gaming. Yeah. That''s a big entry point for us. Are there other types of apps that we use every day in the Web2 world that we should be thinking about for crypto? I think like every single thing we use on a day-to-day is bound to be on chain. Without us really... I think we''re going to remove the crypto from it. Like, you know, what is it? Helium, the cell phone service thing in the USA that''s killing it right now. It''s like free. There''s like this Uber on Solana. Like, there''s so much stuff that we use every day that''s probably going to end up being on chain, but we''re just not going to like feel it. But for me, like it was really about prediction markets because, you know, we''re in media, and it''s the best way to get like consumer sentiment in real time, right? But what do you think? What do you want to see more out of crypto? For me, I want to see less crypto in crypto. I agree with you. I think for me, the folks that are impressing me are the ones that stop talking about blockchains. I think there''s projects, you know, we''ve all talked about Blackbird. We''ve talked about what Luke is doing with Pudgy. The way we can get people to play with crypto when they don''t know they''re playing with crypto is the key. I don''t care what technologies are that I work with on my phone, on my computer. I care that they work. I also don''t think we''ve seen enough good successes of the rewards mechanisms that we were promised, right? Remember when everyone was building like a loyalty play? Yeah. And then every loyalty play became like Starbucks or, you know, a farm. You know, the idea that I could have my airline points, those would convert to my hotel points. They already do that. We don''t need those mechanisms. We need new things. I also like the idea of what could DeFi be if it wasn''t financial, right? So if you think about the idea that I can do alternate ways of getting involved with artists, with creators, with players, any of that, where I don''t have to feel like I''m just trying to beat the fees of the financial system. I like that. I think there''s an opportunity there. DeFi with other financial assets? Yeah, exactly. I think there''s some interesting stuff to play with there. We have a great day today. So both Farok and I are going to be spending some time up here talking to some interesting people. We''ve curated an amazing group of moderators and panelists. We''re going to talk about gaming. We''re going to talk about art. We''re going to talk about a lot of culture. Is there anything you''re excited about for today? Honestly, I think that this stage is going to be pretty well curated, by the way, y''all. Hang tight. I mean, there''s a lot of good people. Obviously, I''m excited to see my friends over that power the space. Well, Kinetic, Mox, so fun. But I really like the fact that we''re focused on culture. Because tech is great, but culture literally powers every single thing in this entire conference. Without culture, without the people speaking for the culture, then there''s very little left when you think about it. Because you talked about how you want to see less crypto in crypto. So the way you get less crypto in crypto is with people like yourself, like myself, and the people who are going to be hosting on the space to empower this industry. There are some people that believe crypto does not have culture. And the reason I say that, and I want to get your reaction, the reason I say that is because when you look at a culture of fashion, you look at the culture of music, gaming, it took years and years to build. And people sort of were doing those actions in the beginning without feeling like they were going to get financially rewarded to it. The minute we put financial rewards into it, we''ve been seeing a lot of bad actors in the last couple months really take advantage of people who want to be in it for the culture. But you''re someone who runs, you run a show every single day. You talk for hours and hours. You''ve really brought so many people into this space. So I think you represent culture better than most people. But what do you think we''re missing in terms of the minute we think we have a culture and then a meme coin comes out and someone rugs $10 million and everyone loses money, they want to run away from this. How do we kind of get culture to be a little bit more sustainable? That''s a tough question today, right? Yeah. Out of all days. We just got rugged so hard by a president. Wait, which president are you talking about? Malay. Okay. I''m making sure. Where''s he at? Is he in prison yet? But, you know, it''s a tough date. It''s weird. It''s such a tough... Like, it''s weird today, man. I''m not going to lie. Because we do have a culture. And we have a beautiful one. And this crypto culture is amazing because when I got into this space, I felt like I was at the cusp of, like, cutting edge of art. I know you''re a big art fan. You''re friends with Sam Spratt, Benny, all those guys. So they run the game, right? You know, Snowfro. So the cutting edge of art, for me, media. I know it''s the same for you. So I''m enamored with media. It''s my passion. It''s what I do every day when I wake up. Last thing I do when I go to sleep. Tech, everything. But then again, you have people that come into our culture, use it, abuse it, and leave us for dead. And then what''s left is you and I on this stage talking about it the day after everybody got destroyed. And it''s tough. So this culture, like, gets weaker and weaker by day. And I feel like a lot of us have to, like, work really hard hand in hand to, like, protect it because it''s a very strong culture. I''m very proud of it. Like, it''s like, I''m as proud to be in crypto as I am proud to be Persian. You know what I mean? It''s like my, there''s a meme. Like, all my friends make fun of me because I''m, like, so proud to be Persian. Like, ah, for real. Not everything''s about being Persian. I''m like, all roads lead back to ancient Persian. You know, I have to joke with that. But it''s like the same thing with crypto, right? And I think we really have to keep building it and building it and defending it, right? There is a culture here. Like, all the people here care about this space. There''s a lot of great founders. I know you guys handpick all the partners that are even allowed to be here and present. Like, there is this culture here and we need to preserve it at all costs. So, you mentioned media. CoinDesk is in the media. You have, really, Rug Radio and Decrypt. So, you have two different media channels. How do you feel when you guys have done all this work to get a story out and then someone, you know, puts a tweet out that they''re just made up because they want to move a market, right? And then suddenly you''re like, ah, all this stuff that I''ve been doing, you know, really can be underdone by someone who has 100,000 followers who happen to, you know, be... Citizen journalism! It''s all citizen journalism. But, like, how can we better play with our public to say, we want you to be a part of the process, but we also want you to trust that, you know, the folks who are putting in the hard work, your reporters, what we do, that that actually is what you should be paying attention to. I mean, it''s funny, right? Because we have both, right? Over at our parent company, Dustin, like, we have Rug Radio and we have Decrypt. So, it''s like a weird... It was actually weird at first because, like, when Lox and I took over Decrypt, I''d be like, whoa, how does this work, dude? Because I''m not a journalist, but I''ve grown to have so much respect for you and what you do as a journalist, like, because we completely separate the companies. I''m not allowed to be in the slack of Decrypt, right? Because God forbid... Probably for the best. No, for the best, really. Like, I''m in no channels. I have no idea what''s going on. I was texting my writer that said, yo, are we covering this Javier Millet thing? Like, do we have someone investigating it? Because I can''t even see. Yeah. I''m not even allowed to be in it, not only because I''m the president, but I''m also a big, like, voice in crypto, like, you know, influencer, whatever. I hate the term, but whatever you call it, but that''s what they call it, right? So, I''m not allowed to have a vision on it. So, it''s different because I''m a creator. I''m never going to call myself a journalist. Actually, that''s an insult to journalism. I think journalism is such a beautiful and pure profession, and I''ve grown to have so much respect for it, even more than before, because what you guys see is like, oh, they''re writing pieces. They''re just writers. They''re not, dude. And there''s so much work that goes behind it, like the piece that you guys wrote that just came out this morning, uncovering a lot of what happened with the Argentina coin. But, like, we''re creators. We create content all day long. But then you have people that spend all their life and that probably make a little less money than the average person with 100,000 followers that''s able to get all these coins, these allocations, because journalists are not allowed to touch any of that. Nothing. Actually, our journalists are not even allowed to predict a myriad. You know what I mean? They''re not even allowed to play. And so it''s so different, but you grow to have so much respect for this. And I think we have to really preserve that, right? The coin that I was talking to you about this behind, CoinDesk, The Crypt, these are companies that are so important to this industry and I genuinely think that we need to do our best to preserve and support them. The final thing I want to talk to you about, I know we''re going to touch on it all day, but we have founders here, we have some of the blockchains here that have been spending years building what they''re building. And, you know, they can have a premise and they can say, we want to build a better technology to do this specific thing. We think the blockchain does really well. They work really hard. They get their token to a $2 billion market cap. Someone comes along, you know, puts a scarf on a pig, you know, has a big influence, and suddenly there''s a meme coin that''s $5 billion. A pig with a scarf. A pig with a scarf, exactly. Don''t start that, please. But, you know, suddenly you have meme coins that have come out of nowhere, are skyrocketing, and becoming more valuable in some of these chains that people have been building years to build. And, you know, and then we also see because of this, everyone wants to get in on the next $5 billion coin. And suddenly, you know, I saw this with some friends of mine over the weekend. They launched a coin, it went to $12 million. By the next day, it was worthless. Yeah, of course. Right? All in less than 24 hours. So, as someone who plays a lot in the cultural side of it, how do we address the fact that meme culture, while being amazing and part of our future, also has a tremendous easy way of being gamed by those on the inside? I mean, the casino is rigged. And there''s never been a better day to say this than today. You know, it''s demoralizing. Because for me, it''s weird. I have the trader culture, like, influencer Farouk hat. Then there''s, like, the founder Farouk. Yeah. And we work so freaking hard to build Myriad. And it gets a lot of attention. Thank God. I''m lucky. We get a lot of attention. We have all the attention on the planet. So I''m blessed. But so many founders out here, they get zero attention. But they''re way more talented than 99% of the people I''ve ever met in my freaking life. That''s why we try to empower them as much as possible on the rock video side. It''s demoralizing. There''s nothing more demoralizing than seeing meme coins go to billions of dollars and you''re working your ass off to build something that''s worthless. Yeah. Why? Right? But on the other side, this casino''s about to... I think the casino''s... I mean, the casino never closes. There''s always gonna be a win. Yeah. Right? But there''s always gonna be a Flamingo and that shit ain''t good. Right? No offense to the Flamingo owners. But, you know, it''s just like... This casino is rigged. It''s rugged. It''s fake. And I highly encourage people to start actually empowering founders. Sure. Sure. You may make your money slower. You may get your return on these blockchains you''re investing in over 6, 12, 24, 48 months. But at least, you''re not gonna get destroyed overnight. Because there''s a lot of these meme coins you hold. You don''t know if you can go to bed. Actually, I left the casino months ago. Good for you. A few months ago, I said, I''m done. Do a little trade. It''s nice. Stop. And my Oura Ring has never had... Told me I''ve never had better sleep than the last month. I swear to God, there''s data to back that. So, I highly encourage people to just maybe... Go around. Turn off the casino. Turn off the casino for a little bit. Okay? Shut it down. Okay? It''s good. I''m not... I love Pomfon. I like the founders. I love the whole thing. I''m a fan. It would be hypocritical for me to say I''m not a fan. But go around. Meet some people, you know? See what''s up in the space. Well, speaking of that, so this day, on this stage, all day, we''re going to have some amazing creators, people who are building some incredible companies, some who have had great successes. We''re going to talk to them, the gaming space, the AI space, the art space. We''re going to talk about all the people who are building crypto-native brands and the lessons to learn. So, with that, we''re going to get to our content. Farouk''s going to leave for a minute. Yes, sir. I''m going to stay here, interview a founder and an amazing marketer I look up to very much. So, Farouk, love that. Thank you so much. Thank you for grabbing me. I''ll see you at 1.30. See ya.', 'Welcome to the first ever Consensus Hong Kong.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('what_fuels_markets__an_inside_look_at_how_markets_flow', 'What Fuels Markets_ An Inside Look at How Markets Flow', '未知講者', '未分類', ' Hello, good afternoon everybody. So I''m really excited to be here with the all-star panel from the market making trading industry to understand how crypto markets are flowing, liquidity. So I have with me, Tomar Hestu, CEO of B2C2, Yongjin Kim, co-founder of Presto, and Michael Higgins, international CEO and global head of corporate development at Eden Road. So we saw a lot of institutional flows last year coming into the Bitcoin ETF and generally crypto ETF with the launch as well of option trading on the ETF. All the dynamics have changed a lot. Can you explain the structural changes in terms of client types and products that you have seen from your perspective, Thomas? Sure. Thanks for listening. Great to be here in Hong Kong on the panel. And maybe to answer the question, I start by explaining where we sit in that system. In the ETF space, we''re the wholesale market. So usually the issuers comes to us to buy the physical Bitcoin that backs the ETF. Probably to remain structured, we can split it into who joined the market thanks to the ETF. And here we have plenty of public data because if you''re the largest holders of the ETF, you actually have to disclose your name. So who holds the most ETF today? Millennium, 0.72. So the largest hedge funds of the planet. And then on the other side, you''ll have the prime brokers, Goldman''s, Morgan''s, who facilitate transactions for their clients as PV. So to answer the first order question, who did it open the market to? The largest capital holder of the planet who were able to deploy in the Bitcoin space. To the second question, what did it change in the ecosystem? Well, first, there is between 40 to 50 billion of capital injected into ETF. So definitely it supported the price action of Bitcoin. So that''s the first order. But then the second order was to create a new ETF liquidity pool that today in Bitcoin is about 15 to 20 percent of the total Bitcoin liquidity. So meaningful, meaningful impact. It brought other type of market makers, the ones who were usually ETF specialists, suddenly were able to provide capital and balance sheet to the crypto ecosystem. And so what''s visible? If I take numbers, you''ll take a basis as a reference because a lot of those funds, what they came to do was to buy the ETF, sell the future, capture the interest rate basis that exists between those two. If you take 2021, you take peak market, peak bull market, you had basis was up to 220 percent annualized return on your position. So amazing returns. This year, 2024, well, we had like a similar trajectory in terms of Bitcoin. The basis was never went ahead of 40 percent. Why? Why? Because this new pocket of capital and those new people, they came to compress the market and injecting their dollars into the system. So with the ETF open, it paved the road for the largest player of the planet. What was the impact? It erased or reduced some of the anomalies that existed in the market. And they provide for a more stable, reliable market in the ecosystem. Thank you. Yongjin, have you seen any changes last year? Yeah, let me add a short comment to Thomas. So, yeah, we definitely saw structure changes after ETF was introduced. We can see that BTC volatility was a lot lower compared to other, you know, the other coins. And then we can see that over market sentiment is more focusing on to U.S. macro numbers now than ever. So I think those two are the good indications that the market is more institutionalized. And then the majority of the market drivers are coming from big institutions, like mostly from U.S. Okay. Michael, because Eden Road is in the middle of all those participants, right? What have you seen on your side? And have you seen a lot of change because of the regulatory impact as well happening at this? You know, what is your perspective? Yeah, sure. We do sit between tens of billions of dollars a day of trading. And so just very briefly introduce Hidden Road. So we''re a multi-asset PB and clearing firm that was set up and funded by the buy side. So a sell side business funded with buy side capital. We''ve done effectively two things in the last six years. First is we''ve worked on improving the technology behind prime brokers, clearing and margin financing in the traditional space and applying those applications into digital assets. And second is we''ve taken an innovative approach to bring balance sheet into the market in the traditional space. And again, in digital by tapping into large pools of private credit. So summing up what a PB is, is we''re really access providers. We provide access to two things. One is to trade across the entire liquidity landscape and the asset classes and products we support. And second is to have balance sheet for those names to trade across that in a capital and cost efficient way. And so to your question, we do have a unique view from where we sit. And so we''ve certainly seen a spike in the number of institutional counterparties coming into this space. A number of drivers, the one you''ve mentioned, though, the positive tone change out of the U.S. led by the new administration under President Trump. But I think it''s important to remember that the previous administration really suppressed the market for the past four years. Someone recently described it as having the knee on the back of the neck of the industry. And I think that''s right. I mean, folks were frankly terrified to come into this space. So a lot of that reputational risk is now removed. And so you can measure that in two ways. You can measure that by the sheer number of counterparties coming in, as well as reflected in the price action that my colleagues have briefly mentioned. And so while the reputational risk is largely removed, there''s still a number of hurdles, I would say. We need certainty from these regulators. We need financial transparency. And then on the market structure side, we need to do a number of things. But the main one is to separate the function of trading from the function of asset holding and collateralization. And by doing that, it''ll lead to best practices across both of those disciplines. And so kind of to wrap up, we''ve seen greater liquidity come into the market. And on the back of that, greater product development. We''ve seen options. We''ve seen ADRs coming online. And so with this greater inflows, there''s a need for greater accessibility or accountability from the digital assets as a whole. And so to leave on one statistic, when options on IBITS ETF went live, it was November 19th, it traded 73,000 contracts in the first 60 minutes, making it a top 20 non-index product. And so to me, that shows clear demand for mature products to come in. But summing up from a liquidity standpoint, I think we''re in a good position. Yeah, crazy, those options on ETF. So Yong-jin, since we''re based in Hong Kong and you''re a big player in Asia, do you have some perspective between US and Asia in terms of how the liquidity is flowing here in the region versus the rest of the world? Yeah. Yeah. So one notable difference between Asian markets and US markets is that we do see that much more, you know, volume concentration towards, like, small cap coins, like odd coins in Asian markets compared to European hours and US hours. So I think that implies that the Asian markets are still driven by retails, not the institution flows. And I would say another, like, major difference is, you know, in Asian markets, I do see that there''s premiums. I think it''s partially due to the capital control on some of the Asian countries, like, for example, Korea, Japan, Taiwan also has a premium. So, like, in Korea, like, a lot of people are even, like, relying on that strategy. Like, they call it kimchi premium. You know, so, like, the Bitcoin in Korea is way more expensive sometimes compared to other regions. So those two are the good signs that shows that it''s still, like, retail-centric and still quite inefficient relatively compared to the other regions in the market. Yeah. I will add a bit my perspective on that one. I work at Fidelity International and we do the marketing of Fidelity Investment Bitcoin ETF. And what we have seen is that Asian investors are actually going into the US ETF. And when you look at the reporting on the 13F filing, you can see a few of them in there. So I think, you know, that had as well a bit of dynamics between Asia and the US there. So we see a lot of fragmentation, right? Maybe, if I may, on Asia, there''s this trading piece and there''s also who trades. And I think I''m fully supportive of the view. Without talking about capital control, there''s just flow of fund is a challenge in Asia. Currency first. So it''s expensive to go from one currency to another, time to move capital. And I think when we look at Asia, we see really three distinct client types and problematics that are being solved. If we go to Japan or Korea, it''s essentially a retail market, very closed market. So low connectivity to the rest of the ecosystem, creating those premiums. But it''s essentially driven by a retail community. When you get out of here and you come to places like Hong Kong, what''s unique about Hong Kong, of course, you have financial institution. But this is also the city that holds the second largest number of ultra net worth individuals, more than $30 million. There''s 12,000 of them in Hong Kong alone. Hong Kong comes second to New York. So there is an immense market when you come to Hong Kong of high net worth individuals. And what they are looking for is vastly different type of exposure to the asset class that the retail want. Retail would like a new coin or something they can believe in. The high net worth will be looking at yield. They''re trying to ensure longevity and prosperity of their wealth. So this is a big dimension in TradFi, by the way, but also in the crypto space. And then when you get out into other countries of Asia, you still have a bit of the retail dimension. But the probably function of GDP, the spare money allocated by retail to crypto trading drops. So what''s the biggest use case that comes is actually solving those cross-border problems. So when you get out of the major cities, Singapore, Hong Kong, and or Korea, Japan, you fall very fast into the cross-border movement of value, an explosion of stable coins, so on and so forth. So, you know, I think what makes Asia so different from the U.S., where there is one currency, high amount of capital control by small amount of people, is the diversification or maybe the fragmentation, which is more commonly used language, that we see in Asia. And I think going forward, Asia will be looking for more solutions for efficiency gains to actually unify all those markets. So you do see a lot of opportunity for B2C2 in Asia? Today, our position is to be as much, to the extent that we can, and that comes to regulation, banking, so many constraints. But our job is actually to bring all those different use cases together. Buy Bitcoin from Japan and sell it to somebody in Hong Kong, and then use the dollars to use a stable coin to help somebody move money to Thailand. That''s the type of flow that we try to orchestrate. So would you say that we''ve seen more fragmentation or better efficiency because of all those products coming? Fragmentation was there before. We''ve made a lot of progress into bringing the… And it''s not just us. You have companies that connect various markets, high-velocity market makers, and then you have primes that help get capital together. It''s not… Yes, of course, it''s just us. But in reality, we''re not alone. Maybe your team''s perspective on fragmentation versus liquidity. Yeah. Efficiency. Yeah. It''s… Yeah. It''s… The Asian markets are quite fragmented. Yeah. And then, yeah, we do see many, like, cross-border and, like, you know, cross-asset opportunities as a trading firm. But it has improved over the last two, three years? It''s actually… It''s actually getting less and less opportunity because the market is getting more efficient. So more efficient. Yes. Okay, okay. Yes. Yes. I get to my answer. Yeah. More efficient. Yes. Michael. Look, I think the question of fragmentation is really a… it''s a market structure question, right? And if the current infrastructure lends itself for efficiencies. And so, I think there''s two things to remember. One is that crypto is still very, very early on. The second is that crypto has really started with retail users in mind and you now have institutions coming into the space. So we need to redo a lot of the infrastructure that''s out there. And so, looking at the market, it''s fragmented across dozens of exchanges. It''s fragmented across the products. You have spot, perpetual swaps, calendar futures, options, ETFs. Then you have the regulated markets like the CME. And so, there''s fragmentation or inefficiencies on the banking side. But I think the biggest inefficiency has been the capital inefficiency side. All of these exchanges, again, designed for retail are all pre-funded. And so, if you want to see real efficiencies in the market, then what needs to happen is institutions need to be able to scan the market in real time to be able to deal on best price. By the way, they''ll end up having a fiduciary responsibility to do that. And so, therefore, the market will attract scaled-up intermediaries. There''s four I can think of. Number one is on the connectivity side. Somebody to connect you to consume all that market data and route your orders. There''s a couple good solutions. Talos comes to mind. Number two is that you need third-party capital providers or credit providers to inject leverage into the system to allow folks to trade in a capital and cost-efficient way. In the traditional markets, those are referred to as prime brokers, like Hidden Road. The third one is these two gentlemen sitting here, which is scaled-up market makers to really drive down the cost of execution. And then lastly, I would say is really just to kind of have the right regulatory environment overseeing that to make it efficient. And so, I think, you know, as the market matures and participation broadens, it''ll increasingly look like the FX market structure probably would better legal and technology standards, more conformed technologies, and more robust operating procedures. But we''ll need to follow some of the other asset class that trailblazed ahead of us to really get to those efficiencies. Don''t you think we need – because you''re talking about capital access and being able to flow the capital quickly. Like, the link between TradFi and DeFi, in that case, coming into, you know, RWA tokens that can play that whole, like, stable coins are – Do you see some opportunity in terms of product innovation there? I – well, I certainly – product innovation, I mean, Thomas alluded to, you know, basis, right? And so, there''s already TradFi trading with the native crypto markets, your long spot selling CME front month against that. And so, if you need access, then, you know, how do you get cross-margining inefficiencies? In terms of, you know, innovative products to the market, I mean, Hidden Road has been an early supporter of RWA initiatives, specifically on the tokenized money market side of it. I think it''s important to remember why that''s important, which is it really looks at the underlying use case of the blockchain technology, right, to be able to tokenize these assets. And so, generally speaking, crypto is a non-carry asset, similar to gold, meaning it doesn''t pay interest. And so, when you look at large investment portfolios, gold''s a small portion of it. And so, taking a security that pays interest, tokenizing that, and allowing that to be used as good collateral, I think is a step in the right direction. Now, there''s different use cases for it. If you''re a proprietary trading firm, you take your capital, you post it, you get leverage, and you reuse that capital. But if you''re a multi-billion dollar macro hedge fund, then taking a portion of your treasury and holding in these assets might make sense, because that gives you flexibility to meet collateral calls, more efficiency, or trade or express trading opinions outside of market hours or on the weekend. And so, you know, look, I think the theme of consensus is reimagining finance and how commerce is transacted. And I think these products are, there''s a place for them, and they neatly fit in line with that approach. Thomas, do you have some perspective on RWA tokens? Contrarian? Yes, I do. Not necessarily what everybody wants to hear. Do I think all assets will be moving on-chain? I''m fairly convinced. As to the path that we''re taking, we''re trying to fit two worlds. One, there is the ecosystem of crypto, which leaves by, we can move money instantly or almost instantly via stablecoins, via coins, via coins, via coins, which is where you can move collateral really fast from one place to another. And that is fundamental to what we are doing. So anything that''s going to come on-chain, we''ll have to respect those properties. The second piece is thanks to the velocity of capital or movement of value, we''ve also been able to do things like we can fund ourselves every four hours on perpetuals that have been designed by the large exchange, fund themselves, not all of them, and some of them is eight, some of them is four. But again, taking what TratFi has done forever, which is sync up on a daily basis to net capital, we''re now in four-hour window. So when you take a tokenized wrapper and you put in a TratFi asset, you''re still bound by the constraint of the underlying. So I think here it makes it, and I''d love to hear your perspective, it makes a money market on-chain difficult to use for the purpose of the business that we are operating today. So I think the, you know, from where we are today to where we want to go, it''s the underlying asset that needs to evolve. Not just a wrapper, tokenizing something or putting something on-chain today is very well done by a lot of people, and it''s fairly easy. So what''s blocking the adoption? Mainly from the crypto ecosystem, the utility, which is bound by the asset it carries. And then the second piece is regulatory, I''ll just say one word here is the digital ecosystem has been channeled into one way, which is regulated by digital asset license. But to trade traditional assets, you actually need licenses that are detained by people who do not trade digital assets. If you want to distribute an equity, you need a securities license, not a digital asset license. So I think those two points, like the evolution of the underlying asset on one side and the regulatory landscape, materially slows down the adoption of real-world assets. Yeah. Yongshin? Yeah. So I think RWA, the actual meaning is to deliver better accessibility in both ways. So in Presto, we actually were selling some of the structured products to some of the family offices, and we see much more demand and interest than before. Like, for example, in Tradify, delivering low tens of yields is surprisingly good if you can achieve a very stable return. But in crypto, in bubble time, if you put your tether in Binance, you can easily get 12% or 30% sometimes. So, like, there is a gap between the expectations and then in terms of inefficiencies, relative inefficiencies in Tradify and crypto. So we''re trying to bridge the gap by providing those structured products to the Tradify side. And also, like, tokenization of the securities, I would say there are various ETPs, you know, in the U.S. markets, and they''re getting a lot of interest from Asian retail investors. For example, like Tesla, 3X, ETP. That''s quite risky, but some people want, I mean, they''re willing to take the risk. But, you know, for now, to have that access, they have to go through NASDAQ. But if you can tokenize those opportunities and wrap it up and then redistribute through the digital asset license, as you said, not through the security license, I think that will revolutionize the finance. And then they''ll open up a more, much more investment opportunities for retails who doesn''t necessarily have U.S. equity access. I''d just say one thing on the regulatory side, right, which is my fear is shoehorning this into existing Tradify regulations because I''m not sure that''s the best idea when we have the opportunity to create something new. And so I was thinking about it the other day, and I was kind of thinking, like, it''s the early stages of the Internet, right? So we need to take a light-touch, pro-innovative approach to it. And so to Thomas''s point, you know, do you need a securities license to move these things? Currently, that''s the thinking. But perhaps, you know, that will change as this asset class continues to evolve. Yeah. So we are almost at time. So one last question. You know, what is your wish for crypto to be more efficient in 2025? Fine. Maybe we start on making. Besides Bitcoin being higher. One wish for 2025. I''ll kind of stay on the theme of infrastructure and what''s important there. And so I think the industry needs to move towards paradigms and standardization. There''s been a lot of resistance to that. And the one that sticks out for me is the legal documentation and the legal framework. And maybe it''s moving, you know, properly towards ISDA as that will create certainty and finality to trade and settlements. And that will just give comfort for a lot more institutional capital to come into more of the native side of crypto. But I can continue on. But I''m conscious of time. Hilton. So my personal wish is, yeah, other than BTC going to the moon, is that clearer definition on security tokens, I would say. Because I don''t see any downside of, you know, security tokens. Because, you know, being security means, you know, like more accountable, more responsible for, yeah, for the longevity. So, yeah. So what is Ethereum security or not? Like no one knows. I mean, because the regulators are still, like, quite ambiguous on this topic. So I wish we could see a clearer picture on what''s a clear definition of security. What can we list on the exchange? What can DAX? I mean, who can onboard on the DAX? These kind of issues. Yeah. Thomas? If I stay on the theme, I think this year we''re all very optimistic about regulation coming to the U.S., regulation coming to Europe, regulation coming everywhere, which means more participants on one side for sure. And also, it kind of sets crypto assets into eternity. Once we have a regulation, it''s actually fully recognized. That''s very good. Wonderful. I think the second risk that we''re running now, and therefore my wish for the ecosystem, is that the regulatory frameworks that are being put in place, MICA, what the U.S. will put in place, even Asia, hopefully Hong Kong progresses, is that we don''t set up a regulatory framework that is too cumbersive, too onerous, too punitive, to the extent that we actually prevent the innovation, prevent leveraging the innovation, the asset class or the products that have been developed on chain provide. So I really hope that what''s going to be developed is comprehensive and we carry the industry forward by opposition to constraining it, which wouldn''t be a first in finance. Okay, so clear regulation, Bitcoin going up, and room for innovation. I would say that''s the key word. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Thank you, Emma. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('where_does_ethereum_go_from_here_', 'Where Does Ethereum Go From Here_', '未知講者', '未分類', ' Hello everybody, I hope everybody''s feeling great because we''ve got a lot to discuss when it comes to the future of Ethereum. If that is something close to your heart be sure to listen closely. My name is Matt, I lead BD for Redstone which is an Oracle provider. I''ll give you a brief introduction to what we do at Redstone in a minute but before that I would love our great panelists to introduce themselves today so that everybody can be on the same page. So Mike why don''t we start with you. What''s EtherPi? What do you do on the team? How does it work for you guys? Yeah sounds good. Hi everyone. My name is Mike. I''m the founder and CEO of EtherPi. EtherPi is the fourth largest crypto protocol by TVL. I guess depending on the day we''re about 7 billion in assets and we have a suite of integrated products that create effectively a banking alternative for users. So where users are able to save, stake, deposit, deploy their assets in DeFi and then spend and borrow against their DeFi assets. Perfect. Sandy why don''t you jump in and tell us something more about Scroll and what do you do on the team? Yeah well it''s great to be here. It''s great to see so many people. So I''m a co-founder for Scroll and we''ve been building for about four years now on a holistic blockchain solution that is both secure and performance. We''re layer two on Ethereum and we''re here to support builders and find out various financial applications that can increase financial access and using smart contract platforms to build more creative things. Perfect and when it comes to Redstone we are an Oracle provider specializing in yield bearing collateral for lending markets and we have been in the trenches when it comes to Ethereum for a couple of years now actually working with both of our panelists and their their protocols both with EtherPi and and Scroll as well. And there''s big things coming for us over at Redstone. Probably next week is going to be one of the biggest weeks in the history of the company. So just a little show from my side but be sure to stay tuned on that one as well. Follow us on Twitter. Now that being said that has been a quite quite a wild year I would say for Ethereum quite a roller coaster in terms of the price action that''s one the sentiment that''s two but also the whole discussion that has been happening in terms of the fundamentals of the chain the ecosystem in terms of value capture in terms of the future of what we want to build here. So why don''t we start with a simple question. When you open Twitter app and you go and search for Ethereum the sentiment is pretty bad I would say at this point. What''s your guys''s take high level? Is it as bad as it seems on the fundamental side of things or are we on the right track but it''s just a fad that is just going to fade away quite quickly. Mike why don''t we start with you? Well so much of it has to do with just the broader market right. The price action just hasn''t been great and it''s important not to confuse sort of the fundamentals of a product with kind of the ups and downs of a market. In terms of sentiment I actually we have you know maybe some additional insight from the internals of the Ethereum foundation and kind of what goes on within Ethereum broadly. So it feels actually that there''s a lot of cause to be optimistic based on some of the changes that that are taking place and so I feel like we''ve kind of bottomed out. The meme coin mania feels like it''s topped out and now has you know is very rapidly kind of declining and so so I''m actually very optimistic about the next you know the next few years around Ethereum. Sandy? I would say Ethereum price action has been surprisingly steady despite the entire market ups and downs. I would arguably think of it as a as a stable coin by now and the stability of it is a joke but it''s rooted around the the idea that the ecosystem has blossomed and it''s very very decentralized and there''s been a lot of community criticism around Ethereum not doing a great job at advocating for its position within the market but another way to look at it is that there''s a open space for anyone within the ecosystem to kind of take that role and present their vision and when I think about Ethereum infra side of development there''s a lot of things happening under the surface from increasingly faster and faster ZK proofs being produced to account abstraction innovation and keystore and UX improvements all of these things are done by different teams around the world and in aggregate I think in two to three years time will be super clear in setting Ethereum ecosystem as a whole as categorically and also holistically the best blockchain to work on that is both decentralized secure and super scaled and and I don''t see any other ecosystem that has that level of vibrancy and different paths to this ultimate vision as Ethereum on the application level there''s also a lot of innovation the fact that Ether5 being the fourth largest protocol only started like relatively recently and so that just shows it''s an open economy where new players have a clear shot at bringing something unique to the ecosystem and there are still lots of open spaces to build maybe the only thing if I may add is just there''s so much exciting stuff getting built on Ethereum it really does feel fair to say that that''s it''s really the hub around blockchain innovation as far as just interesting protocols you know people experimenting with crazy ideas and the broader trad fi market knows none of it like if you talk to a you know random trad fi market the investor ask them about you know ETH versus BTC from their perspective it''s like two different tickers okay BTC oh that''s the big one ETH is you know number two there''s zero understanding effectively about the idea of DeFi that their actual products being built on Ethereum that generate revenue people are building you know real cash flow generating businesses in this space and and trad fight doesn''t you know there''s there''s very little awareness of that and I view that as an opportunity I mean I think we are starting to see the Ethereum Foundation become more vocal and go out there and communicate about all the great stuff that''s happening in the in the ecosystem and I think that''s their role I think they should be doing more of that and so the fact that they''re starting to is makes me feel optimistic about the future I like your guys is optimism it really shows that you''ve spent some serious time as founders as well because optimism is is one of the best predictors of future success for example in professional sports I think for founders this is also a very good predictor I would say I kind of agree with your agreements as well but for the sake of that discussion let me take the other side of that coin the thing that really makes me uneasy as a holder of ETH where ETH is a serious portion of my network as well is the fact that you know I''ve spent some serious time in startups as well enough to know that focus on focus and clarity on on the principles and the vision the goal the one single thing that you want to build is of utmost importance and then citing John Charbonneau here he''s he''s done this very good post one of the shortest post of his it''s only like 58 minutes of reading where he basically breaks down the ecosystems that we have right now some of the biggest ones we''ve got ETH Solana Bitcoin and Celestia and when you look at all of them everybody has a very very clear goal in mind for which the infrastructure is very much optimized so Bitcoin obviously the digital gold this is I would say self self-explanatory when it comes to Solana it''s increased bandwidth reduced latency when it comes to Celestia it''s the big blocks it''s you know you''re not going to be able to fit the whole internet on a single state machine so we have to build for module or we have to bring the costs down of operating something like a roll-up whereas Ethereum there is many many discussions on should we optimize for the L1 should we optimize for the L2 should we optimize for the optimistic L2 or ZKVM''s should we should we try to be something else that we are trying to be right now so a lot of discussion and not a single clear vision in terms of where exactly we would like to go some of the best people in that space or some of the most vocal people in that space leaving for a variety of reasons like Max Resnick going to the Solana land as well so those things kind of made me made me uneasy because I don''t see a single clear hypothesis that I would really buy into as an investor as a builder as well what''s your take on that is it the default state of how things should be at this stage of maturity of the ecosystem that we are just building for a variety of different things or is it the structural problem in terms of not knowing what exactly we want to do I''ll take this one so I love John''s research reports they''re very succinct and very clear and frames the problem he sees super well and I think his research sometimes includes a very big bag bias as well and I call it Celestia bag over logic bias so I think all of these different frameworks to analyze a blockchain systems is super interesting and if you look at any vertical any single vertical it''s very easy to claim you''re the best so it''s very easy for us to claim we are the best L2 because we have the highest uptime we have the best L2 because we have the fastest zk proofs we''re the best L2 because we have the fastest finality and another L2 you might talk about oh we have the biggest TVL or we have the most users there are multiple different like there are multiple facets to what makes a best blockchain and and I think in the case of Ethereum if you single on and if you zoom in on any of these like single vectors you''re seeing for example the size of the block or how fast transactions are there will be another blockchain that is better on that single vertical but the way to think about the way I think about which decentralized system will ultimately prevail in the long term it''s a mixture of all of these things put together it''s on principle is there still a philosophy around a value choice do we pick decentralization and security over scaling do we prioritize visibility do we prioritize app user experience all of these value decisions determines that the long term and wider direction of where the ecosystem goes and in the short term a platter of ideas and different pathways to achieve the ultimate goal is healthy and the best ideas can battle out and people can vote with their wallets people can vote with their their Twitter accounts and people can vote with their thesis and but there is a when it comes to technology adoptions there is a fundamental truth to it which is like Lindy effect matters and also the truth to it is that I think ethereum is still in the best place when you think about holistically like you know security and decentralization while being as fast and as fast and accessible as possible so I think as long as we''re on a collective path to the building the best holistic platform and the social consensus is strong and there is a very like builder focused culture I think ethereum is still you know got a very strong lead on any other blockchain so I expect every year there will be a faster blockchain and every year there will be technology innovation that comes out that makes a new L1 more robust or more like faster in some sense but it''s about that it''s like it''s like if you''re trying to change the plane and you know that makes a new L1 more robust or more like faster in some sense but it''s about that it''s like if you''re you know, got a very strong lead on any other blockchain. So I expect every year there will be a faster blockchain and every year there will be technology innovation that comes out that makes a new L1 more robust or more like faster in some sense. But it''s about that. Like Ethereum is essentially trying to like change the plane engine while it''s still flying. And it''s been flying for a really long time and it''s been flying steadily. And a lot of what we''re building with ZK and what we''re building in terms of like protocol scaling, these things can essentially be plugged back into the plane once it''s more mature. And I think a direction that we''re super excited to kind of take on as an active member of the Ethereum community is that we''re picking out EIPs in the future pipeline of Ethereum development. and building it out. So we''re building out like new precompiles on like, we''re shipping new precompiles on a once every two week basis. And what that means is that we can iterate a lot faster and respond to builders'' requests and enable more application level innovation. If you remember, like, you know, like the ICO phase was a huge kind of boom in Ethereum activity. And then NFT was another huge kind of period of like, you know, chain enabled, like EIP enabled innovation where we''re trying to capture the next one by kind of taking the responsibility in our own hands to kind of like build, like, you know, do more loops of discoverability to find the next big thing. And I don''t see any other ecosystem that is decentralized enough or have any other organization outside of the foundation that has that kind of ability and agency to build and contribute to the core protocol. So that''s a very long-winded way of saying, like, super bullish on Ethereum. And the strength lies in its decentralization. And different people see different opportunities and there are different touch points to discover new builder requirements. Mike, just one point to that one. When it comes to that point, that question, how does it make you feel as a builder, a businessman that''s essentially very much tied with the success of Ethereum as a platform that you build on? Is it something that you worry about or are you as optimistic as Sandy is for the future? I''ll say two things. I think if you''re building a real business that has customers that are getting value from your product, you should not be dependent on the ecosystem, the particular blockchain that you happen to build on. Because if you are, then are you really building products for people that value the services that you''re providing or are you really just trying to ride the hype wave? And so as much as, obviously, I love Ethereum, our success really is going to be driven by our ability to provide great products for people. I want to make, you know, just you mentioned the comment around Solana, you know, IBRL, is there a North Star and it''s super clear? And I think they''ve actually done a great job of making it super clear. The North Star around Ethereum, the Ethereum ecosystem, has been roll-up-centric roadmap. That''s, I mean, everything around the development over the last, I don''t know, five, six years has really focused on that, enabling tons and tons of Layer 2s, a big variety of those to build on Ethereum. And we''ve seen the success of that. We see every major institution building an Ethereum, you know, a Layer 2 that settles to Ethereum. So there''s success there. The challenge that Ethereum has had is that has come at the expense of scaling the L1. And what makes me optimistic is now it seems like the mindset has shifted, that you need to do both, that you need to scale the Layer 1, reduce gas prices, you know, increase transactions per second, while at the same time, of course, supporting the thriving roll-up ecosystem. So I don''t actually think that, I think the problem has been a communication problem. There needs to be a, I think, lots of folks, let''s say, need to do a better job of communicating that North Star and, you know, what matters to Ethereum. Perfect. So let''s dive a little bit deeper into that and specifically talk about value. And I think it''s great that we have you guys as panelists today representing an L2 and a protocol, end-user-facing protocol built on top of Ethereum and the L2s as well. Because what I would love to get from you is some insights on specifically what value do you get from Ethereum itself, the ecosystem, the L1, for example, starting with you, Sandy, while building something like an L2. Why not just go the completely sovereign way and try to build an L1? Why choose L2 and, you know, becoming a part of the Ethereum ecosystem these days? I think, first of all, when we were thinking about this issue is that we think there is a lot of Lego pieces and tooling that are already existing in Ethereum. And that''s part of the original dev-focused culture that has arised. And so there''s already a lot of existing tools within Ethereum. It makes no sense to rebuild them. And secondly, I think Solidity is coming up as the default smart contract language for any kind of new innovation within decentralized protocol building. So that''s another. I often use the analogy, I think of it as English as being the default international business language, just like Solidity is becoming somewhat the default universal decentralized application building language. And the second thing is because we think the value add, like the initial insight that drove us to build Scroll is that theoretical ZK can be applied to scaling Ethereum. And we designed Scroll with the concept of, and we are close collaborators with the Ethereum Foundation. And there is a version of the ZK EVM that can be upgraded and plugged into L1. So the long-term roadmap, the way we see it, is that L1 will scale, but we don''t want EF to, or EF shouldn''t take on the sole responsibility of designing one version that is going to be the best version. So I think there is a vision where this whole garden analogy, where we build a ZK EVM that''s working, we test it out in the wild, and we test with multiple protocols building on Scroll. And eventually, if it works and it''s very robust, then a lot of the key elements can be plugged back into the L1. And we''re contributors to the base roll-up, and then the base roll-up as a design concept, and also the native roll-up design concept, all of these are based on our experience and learnings from building Scroll as a working L2. And so I think the challenges of doing things this way, or the pros of doing it, is that ETH L1 can continue running, and ETH is the only chain that has run continuously during almost the last, I don''t know, seven or eight years without stopping. And that''s very important for someone to even start thinking about putting a large percentage of their assets on chain. And that is the fundamental basis of that trust. So how do you upgrade this consensus and adding new and nascent technology? I think L2 is a very good testing ground and experimental zone for these things. I see. So basically an existing garden of infrastructure, but also being able to kind of contribute to the main layer and kind of steer it in the way that''s just going to be super sustainable. Mike, when it comes to you, as you said, the success of the decentralized application basically is basically a project on its own. It''s not tightly coupled with the chain that it''s based on. And presumably, as you look at the history of technology, the value tends to go upwards to the layer that really has interactions with the end user, which is DApps in this specific case. So why as a DApp builder, why as a product builder, should I choose the Ethereum ecosystem or Ethereum L1 these days? What does it give you? What''s the value that you can get from it? Yeah, that''s a great question. And the answer is really simple. You know, the question, I guess, is do you give a shit about crypto? In other words, do you just want to build some centralized thing that has enough decentralization theater that allows you to launch a token and grift? Or do you actually care about the, you know, original sort of cypherpunk and crypto values? We do. I do. I actually want to build on a foundation that, you know, respects those values and I think is truly censorship resistant, credibly neutral. I think these things actually matter. So I don''t, there''s no other platform to build on. I mean, there is no alternative smart contract platform that I think fits the bill if you actually give a shit about crypto. If you''re short-term minded, you''re thinking the next, you know, six to 12 months, how can you, you know, suck some cash out of the giant, you know, decentralized casino? Fine. But if you actually build, want to focus on building long-lasting products that, you know, survive the test of time, then, you know, you''ve got to build on Ethereum. So let''s say I come here from traditional finance and I don''t really understand as deeply the decentralization aspect as I would have if I am Web3 native as I am right now. So what would be the, in terms of economic terms, P&L or just building a startup, what would be the value or the one-liner that you would give for Ethereum as opposed to other chains? Just replacing the word decentralization with something that''s like closer to the traditional business. I think the market learns its lessons through kind of a series of calamities. As things blow up, the market develops sort of taboos and, you know, fears around what not to do. And we''re seeing lots of stuff blowing up around us and we''re seeing Ethereum continue kind of happily chugging along. So I think the pitch will be, look, you build on Ethereum because that''s where you go not to blow up. And so over time, I think that, you know, that memory, that collective memory will kind of converge on Ethereum as the place to be. A couple of closing thoughts on that. So it seems like some of the most important fundamental aspects are in place. The infrastructure is well developed. We''ve got a proliferation of things to choose from that we can actually build with. And the security aspect in terms of making a business that''s going to be super sustainable is just second to none on Ethereum. And I guess the biggest problems that we have right now is communication and making sure the narrative is in line with what we are actually building here. So let''s hope we can actually fix this within the next 12 months and ETH can get back to what it should be when it comes to the sentiment on Crypto Twitter. Thank you so much. Thanks for the panel.

We have Flavio, CMO from Polymac. We have Matt Cook, co-founder and Cede, BDO from Mandala Foundation. And Shiga, founder and managing director from Trace Labs and Origin Trail. Hey, welcome. Hey. So, Nico, let''s start with you. You are the co-founder of Velocity Labs. Just give us a quick intro of what you do, but then also more importantly, what''s currently going on in Polkadot Cloud, Polkadot Hub, what do these things mean? Absolutely. Well, first of all, good morning, everyone. Thanks. Thank you for having us here. So, Velocity Labs is a core contributor to Polkadot ecosystem, and we focus on two main areas. One is we do BD for DeFi and infrastructure, so that means that we make sure that the Polkadot ecosystem, with all of its parachains and builders, have all the necessary pieces to actually build great products. So, that includes custodians, centralized exchanges, stable coins, bridges, or close, etc., etc. And then the second arm that we have is a product and engineering arm, where we have a very unique view into how the core protocol development is going, and also how builders are using it, and we kind of find and identify pain points to solve by building tooling and products with our team. So, that''s a little bit of what Velocity does. More specifically around the Polkadot ecosystem and this new framework that we''re using, which is Hub and Cloud. I''m a big fan of analogies, which allow us to kind of abstract these more complex subjects. And the way that I would put it is that Polkadot, since inception, which was four, four and a half years ago, we sort of built race cars when developers were just starting to drive, which basically meant we were too early to the market of actually building and developing chains. Back in 2020, 2021, people were just starting to iterate with smart contracts on generalized chains. We''re starting to build the DeFi primitives or like gamified primitives that we know nowadays. And then after a couple of years, fast forward to today, then the demand for chains and the demand for customization and scalability started to arrive. So, we''re a bit too early. Let''s say this chain concept that we offer as a protocol is what we call Hub. Sorry, what we call Cloud, which is any developer wanting to spin out its own parachain. Now, the other focus that we''re having is kind of focusing in the earlier stage of the builder cycle, which is this concept of Hub. And Hub, we''re leaning a lot into the EVM world. We actually want to lower the barriers of entry to developers, provide those familiar tools of developers in the EVM and in the Ethereum ecosystem, but actually allow them to combine those with Polkadot native functionalities like its throughput, its interoperability, and its scalability. So, yeah, I''ll stop there. That''s a little bit of kind of where we are as an ecosystem. All right. Okay. Thank you, Niklas. Flavio, let''s continue with you. So, you are part of the team from Polymech, and you are an ICO protocol. So, give us a little bit of an introduction, and then I''ll follow up with my question. Yeah, more than happy to do an introduction. So, Flavio from Polymech, as mentioned, we basically bring back ICOs, but this time we settle them on chain. So, we''re a decentralized funding protocol that settles those fundraisers on chain. We have a lot of investors, a lot of projects that are coming to us because they don''t really like the current stage of how basically the baseline is for raising funds. Over the last couple of years, it''s been very dominated by VCs. There was a very opaque scene in primary markets and not a lot of access as well for investors. So, we want to make it more transparent, more accessible, and also more secure by having it on chain. So, without having those reliabilities of centralized parties, no counterparty risk, no financial outsourcing. Since we put everything on chain, it also allows us to act as software, which also in turn then means we are able to integrate with financial intermediaries directly, which is one of the scalability strategies that we are running. So, think of exchanges for the Polkadot OGs. If you remember back in the days, you were able to participate in those part chain auctions or leases on, for example, Crockin or other exchanges. And we are now looking to implement similar products for fundraising just to make capital allocation much more efficient, more accessible, and for you to have some good deals on your table. So, the Polkadot hub is basically the go-to portal for new users and developers, but it''s also the portal that bridges to systems like Ethereum and other chains. So, it gives you access to use the T, use the seed natively on Polkadot, but also this interoperability aspect. Can you go a little bit into how PolyMech is leveraging it? Yeah, more than happy. One of the big reasons why we initially wanted to become a part chain or a roll up, whatever you want to call it, and build on Polkadot was that we have the ability to actually bridge to other chains. Which is also why, I think, I don''t know if this is an exclusive, but we are soon announcing our expansion to Ethereum as well, with other L2s following up. What does that mean? It means we are able to actually have fundraisers from EVM based projects on PolyMech, which is built on Polkadot. You know, Polkadot sometimes is called the relay chain because it relays the messages between all the chains. And I think this is sort of what we look at as a power tool for us to be able to, you know, offer our services beyond any ecosystem and really bridge into every different community and offer those deals. And obviously bridging assets is very important. I think also Nico is playing a big role with Velocity Labs there and supporting us in how can we bridge assets to invest in those protocols, but also then the migration process once those tokens go live. Yeah. So pretty cool. Yeah, I think it really highlights the interoperability aspect of Polkadot where you can connect to different ecosystems and orchestrate all the activity from Polkadot. Absolutely. All right. Okay. Thank you, Flavio. Matt, you are part of Mandala chain, your founder, co-founder, co-founder, co-founder, sorry, co-founder and chief business development officer. Yeah. Right. So for me, this is very interesting because you''re building guv tech or governance tech. That''s at least how I frame it. I''m going to be interested to hear how you frame it. But the interesting part of Polkadot for me is that it''s very heavy on web free, right? It''s not just about DeFi and financialization, but it''s also about bringing a benefit to the real world. And for me, Mandala is a project that really highlights this in terms of developing products that are going to affect millions of people. So maybe can you share a little bit about Mandala and what you''re currently doing? Yeah, sure. It''s great to be here. Thank you. So Mandala chain is based in Indonesia right now, our core team, but we''re very much not focused only on Indonesia. We are starting our initial use cases there because we have a strong advantage with our connections with government and enterprise. What we essentially are is we''re a parachain in the Mandala ecosystem, a layer one capability parachain. So that brings together three different sectors, the government, the enterprise, and then obviously the public permission world. And so we felt that Polkadot, after kind of weighing our options in the beginning, really provided the most modularity and adaptability for being able to cater towards the enterprise or the government needs. A lot of times we have private permission requirements that then need to interact seamlessly with the public retail or decentralized permission world. So Polkadot really allows us to be that solution. So yeah, just a couple other things is that we''re focusing a lot on in the early stages on digital identity because Indonesia has a massive population. And with some of the other use cases that we''re building for microfinance and medical, this allows us to have an identity solution that is able to interact with government and enterprise portals. So yeah, we can talk more about that later. All right. Thank you, Matt. Okay. Shiga. OriginTrail. We founded OriginTrail. And it''s a platform for knowledge assets. Yeah. So I''m very happy about this because it was part of my computer science curriculum. But maybe can you explain a little bit and how it is helping people? Yeah. Yeah. The story or the origins of the OriginTrail date back to 2012 actually when we built the first rudimentary solution to basically improve transparency in supply chains. And that''s over 13 years now. And we''ve done a lot of like different iterations on OriginTrail technology from being a centralized solution to becoming a decentralized solution that was then later employed by much, much larger companies than initially. One of the first companies that initially employed OriginTrail to improve transparency supply chains was a dairy in central Europe. And it already featured. It was already featured the application that was based on OriginTrail back in 2014. So there are still like, you know, TV commercials from back then. And then in 2016, we started experimenting with Ethereum. And we also saw that Ethereum was not, you know, appropriate solution as a blockchain to really drive enterprise adoption. And later on, we have experimented with a lot of additional L2s like Nossys, Matic and so on. But we really found out that none of those solutions can compare, you know, with the parachain infrastructure on top of Polkadot. So what OriginTrail is, is basically a merger between two technologies, blockchain, which you all know here, and knowledge graphs. Knowledge graphs were popularized by Google to power browsing experience. So you can consider OriginTrail technologically as sort of a Google for Web3, although it might sound a little bit, you know, cocky to say this is a Google for Web3. But it essentially works as a Google technology does. And why is that important? OriginTrail right now powers some 20% of overall imports to the United States by supporting audit exchange, audit reports exchanges between major retailers such as Walmart, Home Depot, Costco, Now these audit reports describe what''s going on, what went on within some 30,000 factories that import to the United States. So we kind of see that technology is still better, you know, more suited to be put in place than tariffs right now in the States if you want to improve the frictionless international trade. Then we''re also securing transportation in Switzerland with SBB, Swiss Federal Railways. So those for Switzerland are traveling with train, you''re also, you know, in a way safer thanks to what SBB does with OriginTrail and dozens of other European funded projects. And lately we''ve been also onboarding a partner that handles some 150 million daily users on their internet platform. And all of these things like the real world challenges that we''re tackling require scalability. And today, I believe still by the end of the last year, OriginTrail assumed over 50% of all transactions within the Polkadot ecosystem. So we''re really banging that hard. And, yeah, what''s becoming even more important in the present day is the online content. And we see that AI is now becoming the number one generator of either fake news or, you know, things that are not, you know, according to reality. And this is kind of the next stage where OriginTrail with the help of Polkadot technology will have to even, you know, amp up its activities in order to tackle the new challenges that we''re facing as a humanity. Okay. Wow. I didn''t know the first part that your company has been existing for 13 years. Yeah. So I think it''s a really, it''s a really nice highlight story of how Web3 is popping up as an option to do all of those things in the blockchain space. And you''re doing this transition. It''s really interesting. And I think it''s also nice to highlight that it works for Polkadot cloud as, as, as this space where you can deploy applications like Web3 applications. And you get the throughput that you need. So one thing that is sometimes new for people is that Polkadot is not like Ethereum or Solano or other chains in that it is a single virtual machine, but it''s basically a multicore system. Like on your phone right now, you have multiple processor cores running. Right. And so Polkadot offers a similar thing. So any chain that needs additional resources can tap into those multiple cores. Right. And I was hearing that the you''re already looking forward to this upcoming release when you can tap into multiple cores. Yeah, it''s, it''s definitely just a matter of time when much, much greater scalability is going to be necessary. I mean, it''s, it started small 10, 12 years ago, but now, you know, things are, you know, we are in the big boys league and we need to make sure that we''re using the technology that can support not just Web3 applications, but the mainstream adoption. And mainstream adoption requires, you know, much, much higher levels of scalability and also shared security. And all of these things are, you know, being made possible possible only by Polkadot, according to our experience. All right. Okay. Thank you, Shiga. Nicholas. So I want to dive a little bit deeper into hub, Polkadot hub and what''s upcoming, especially in terms of DeFi, since this is your specialization. And I know that you''re working with a lot of companies to, to get them ready. So can you give us a little bit of a tease? Yep, absolutely. Um, so the hub is basically a component, um, or a project built out of two main components. Uh, one of the main components is we''re actually moving all the functionalities from the relay chain, which is the dot token, uh, governance and staking activities up into this rollup called the hub. And then the second component of this upgrade is turning it into EVM compatible. So it''s going to be the first time in Polkadot''s history that we''re going to be able to develop products that actually tap into these very core functionalities of the Polkadot ecosystem, like governance and staking. So that''s one, uh, obviously giving that we''re making this EVM compatible and allowing smart contracts to be deployed. Um, it''s also very exciting because it''s basically a white canvas where we''re talking to builders and trying to get them to actually come and build, uh, on Polkadot. As I mentioned before, with their familiar EVM, uh, tooling environments, but also being able to leverage these very unique Polkadot functionalities. So we are building from the very typical deep-by primitives like DEXs, UNIB3 type of DEXs, money markets, et cetera, et cetera. But what really gets us exciting is what can be built on Polkadot that can be built elsewhere. And I think that''s kind of probably drive a lot of the activity in, in, in Polkadot going forward. Um, so yeah, it''s something that we''re, we''re really excited for. All right. Okay. Thank you, Nicholas. Flavio. Um, so PolyMik is an ICO protocol, but I think in some way that even undersells it because there is, there is, uh, it, it has such a capacity to do more things because it is its own dedicated chain. So, um, maybe you can share a little bit more about that. Uh, and maybe in relation to, uh, you already did a few of those, uh, ICOs for protocols, maybe some good story to tell here. Yeah. I mean, um, what we usually sell ourselves as what we call a settlement layer, but that sounds a bit boring. So we say ICO protocol. Um, but at the end of the day, we settle deals in the primary market. Uh, so primary markets are not really accessible. There''s no second, no market for it per se. There''s no liquidity for it. Um, so what we provide is we settle those deals on chain, which obviously from day on, uh, day one makes us very scalable on the global stage, uh, very accessible. It makes it very transparent in the sense that, you know, you have the same terms and conditions, um, compared to everyone else investing in those opportunities alongside you. Uh, we have like a slogan and we call it, uh, I am the VC now because we sort of allow everyone to become their own VC and tap into the same opportunities and deal flow. Um, but this goes into this layer of being able to have this, uh, settlement, settlements on, on chain. Uh, on top of that, we also use KYC solutions, which means we sort of create a compliant investing environment, which makes it very important for not only investors, but also for teams to be able to then, you know, later on bring their funds to, because you still need them, banks, uh, or other financial intermediaries that you require for your services. Um, so we sort of create much more of an ecosystem in that sense. Um, it''s a very fragmented market. As you know, the deal flow is fragmented, the liquidity is fragmented, and we want to aggregate it all in one ecosystem to provide us opportunities. Um, as you mentioned, we, we did have a couple of really cool fundraisers last year. Uh, this year we will have the second wave starting in March. Um, so as you mentioned with the hub going live as well, we also expect much more Ethereum focused projects or EVM compatible projects to build on Polkadot. Uh, to have those smart contracts come over, it''s much easier to build. Uh, you don''t need the entire rollup anymore. So for us, uh, the part is just getting started. Yeah. All right. Okay. Thank you. Uh, round us, round us off a little bit and maybe as a little bit of a tease when once identity becomes possible on Mandala, what are some other applications that you can build on top that have some impact in the real world for, for people? Sure. Well, the, the identity is a key element to onboard more users. So the, the public can actually, the non web three natives can actually participate in, in blockchain without even really knowing it. So whether they''re interacting with their hospitals or their, their bank, um, this is all possible through the KYC and the verified credentials. If we have the UI UX the way it needs to be. Um, but yeah, for Mandala, we''re also working on a lot of other use cases as far as supply chain. Um, also some RWA, uh, tokenization, which is very exciting. We''re going to be launching a marketplace for RWA is very soon. Um, but also our, our kind of Mandala chain Academy has just launched where we''re training up a lot of Indonesian students, uh, university students to, to become, um, let''s say blockchain savvy and understand, uh, various codes like rust and solidity. And so that''s very exciting to be able to onboard, uh, new developers. Um, but also I''d say that the identity solution is now, um, being integrated with some AI infra that will help with fraud protection. And that also will trickle down into some of the finance as well. Um, there''s a lot you could do with the AI agents, um, we''re finding. Um, we''re finding so, um, I''ll also end with, uh, we have a new nation state that we''re onboarding. We can''t make the announcement just yet, but, uh, it''s looking pretty official. So we''re very happy with the copied paste deploy, uh, that we''re building out the infrastructure, the use cases, and then we can just bring that to different countries. Yeah. A new nation state. Okay. Super exciting. Thank you. Yeah. I think we could give you a little bit of an insight into what polka dot cloud and polka dot hub is capable to do. It''s for web free. It''s the place to build web free, uh, where you can build applications that are gonna change the world. So hopefully we can see more of you, uh, coming to polka dot soon and feel free to reach out, uh, to us with any questions. Every good consensus.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('why_sui_will_eat_the_world', 'Why Sui Will Eat The World', '未知講者', '未分類', ' Adni Abiodun All right, my name is Adni Abiodun. I''m one of the co-founders of a company called Mr. Labs. We are the primary contributors to a protocol called the 3 blockchain that''s been live for a matter of about 18 months. We set up the company Mr. Labs to build infrastructure and we felt there was a fundamental problem with the internet. We had opportunities of building infrastructure, Facebook, Google and other large companies and we felt that we''re reaching a point of mass centralization with the internet. Companies are now in a position to own your data, follow you wherever you go, decide to de-platform you whenever they don''t like whatever you do, ultimately make decisions, become judge or executioner based on your data, based on their own preference, and also app stores charging 30% revenue share for products that you build, which ultimately isn''t fair. So the internet is built in such a way where it encourages really centralized behavior and our goal as a company is to change that with a bunch of platforms and protocols that we''re going to build for years and years to come. So SWE is a solution for that. If you think about SWE, what is SWE? And people like to use the words layer one, layer two. SWE is beyond that. It is a global coordination layer. It''s a layer that''s going to allow you to reach agreements across a broad spectrum of assets and broad spectrum of APIs. We believe in the future everybody''s going to be offering a bunch of public APIs. You need a layer that allows you to coordinate the movement of assets between any public API in a very atomic and seamless way. That is a problem SWE is looking to solve. It just somehow you can call that a blockchain, but we believe the targetable, addressable market of solving that problem is way, way larger than what we''re talking about in crypto. So the promise of Web3 is really self-custody. The promise of crypto is really being able to have your own user controls and the ability to coordinate what users want to do intently across the Internet. That is what Web3 promises. And we think the Internet cannot deliver that promise. Web3, married with some amazing technologies that we''re building, will give you those opportunities to solve them. So SWE being a coordination layer, I want to tell you a bit about my team. I''m one of the co-founders. My name is Adinia Björdin. We have George Denizes, who is our chief scientist. Sam Blackshare invented the Move programming language while he was at Meta. We also have Chalkius, who is our cryptographer. So you see the team''s very different from a traditional Web3 company. We''re not all skilled in one thing. Our skill base broadens. It goes very, very broad across programming languages. Evan, who led the R&D team at Facebook, also is an ACM computer science winner who worked on LLVM. So the skill set goes from distributed systems, cryptography. It goes to programming languages. It goes to system design. It goes to product. We believe you need all these amazing skill sets to actually build cohesive infrastructure in Web3, not just one skill set. So we talk about elasticity rather than scalability. Web3 likes to talk about scalability a lot, but really what matters is elasticity. What does that mean? It means as the demands increase for a platform, for a given platform, you can increase the supply. Web3 is built in a way of scarcity, namely as you have more and more transactions, you just hike up the fees and everyone pays more, which isn''t really fair, which means you get penalized for success. And it might not even be your success. It could be a competitive success. It leads to higher fees for everybody else. SWE is built in a way in which we build search at Google and we build infrastructure at large organizations. So as you have more demand for block space in SWE, validators can add more machines, and the more machines you have in the network, the higher the throughput. So there''s theoretically no maximum throughput for SWE because we can add capacity dynamically over time. Separately, there are a number of technologies that just make SWE a pleasure to build on. For example, Move programming language is one of the clearest innovations. This was built after looking at a number of programming languages at Meta, and we found that there was no real comparison for what you could do. If you want to have a world where money is programmable and you want ultimate safety, EVM isn''t the way. Building a solidity is just not the way. And having people trust in just building in Rust is not going to allow you to onboard a lot of developers very quickly. And affording developers to have to know the underworkings of a platform really is a barrier to entry. So Move is one of the easiest languages to learn. It''s actually object-based. Developers are learning Move programming language in about three to four days. We have comments that it''s a 10x performance improvement in trying to build on Solana, for example. The other one is EK Login, where the chain itself will validate your session with OpenID Authenticator. So if you want to control your wallet with Google, you want to control it with Facebook, you want to control it with any service that uses OpenID, the chain itself will validate your session using what we call zero-knowledge proofs. DK Login is probably the most widely adopted consumer implementation of zero-knowledge proofs today. And then finally, we have a standard called kiosks. We heard about the idea of enforcing royalties. Creators were promised that platforms like blockchains will give you the ability to set rules around assets and control royalties and ensure that creators can keep earning their rewards over time. Well, kiosks is actually the only standard of Web3 that helps you really enforce those rules. So you can set really complex enforcement rules, like you can only trade this asset if you have a number of tokens. You can only trade this asset if it''s a particular day and time of the year. You can only trade this asset if you''re part of a particular club or membership. So you can set really, really complex rules around ownership, which is what you really want for digital assets. Again, the account model to a large degree is a bit of a failure for Web3. The world doesn''t work on the basis of accounts. Developers are used to the concept of objects. In SWE, the smallest unit of computation is a strongly typed object. So you can actually build really complex rules and logic in SWE. You build an object, and that object can come with some rich set of rules, which we call intelligent assets. So you have an object that you build, and then you have a smart contract written and move that governs the rules around the object. Who can transfer that asset? How many of those should be in supply? What are the minting strategies required for the asset? Who is a KYC credential required for transfer or minting? So you can really set really complex rules around these assets that we think is very, very difficult to do in other traditional systems to a large degree. That''s what differentiates SWE. And if you compare the code for writing a DEX in SWE versus EVM, for example, you find that it''s probably somewhere in the region of four to five times less verbose writing in SWE than writing on EVM or Solidity. And finally, coordination. In a world where everybody''s going to be offering their products and services via public APIs, you need a way to actually tie these APIs together in a very atomic way. So we have a system called PTBs in SWE. It''s a paradigm that lets you coordinate any number of API calls together and execute them atomically. So if I want to build a super app, I want to book a flight. At the same time, I want to pay for my meals. And at the same time, I want to pay for an excursion on doing a trip. Those can be all different APIs offered publicly, but PTBs tie it together to make it happen atomically. So you can build amazing super apps in a world where the blockchain is an open marketplace for APIs and public goods and services. And developers can choose whatever API they want to build the product experiences that they care about. So SWE''s had a groundbreaking year. We launched an upgrade to a consensus algorithm that cut the consensus latency all the way down to 395 milliseconds. Rather than talking about it, I want to show you an example of what this really means in the real world. So let''s play the video. So this is a transaction as you''ll do in the Solana space on Jupiter. You want to do a swap between one asset and another. You''ll approve that on your wallet. And let''s see how long it takes in Solana. This is the best result we''re able to get trading on Sol. Now let''s compare that to SWE with the same swap, any kind of asset you want to swap. Less than a second. So in the real world, what matters is real world performance. SWE is ultimately 6 or 7x faster, 6 or 7x faster in Solana in terms of finality. And also infinitely faster in terms of actual throughput and scalability as well. What does that mean in terms of numbers? TVL on the chain. SWE is one of the fastest growing network by TVL. Number of users, DeFi protocols. It''s seeing a lot of mass adoption. Quite frankly, the reason why is it''s finding developer product markets that developers are loving. They''re building experience on SWE. They can build strictly differentiated products on SWE that they just can''t build anywhere else. And that''s why SWE has grown significantly beyond other chains. It''s been around for 18 months and I think it''s a number 14, 15 chain in the world. But I think in terms of layer 1s, it''s in the top 10 already. So the team has done a really amazing job this year. And it''s all to do with the innovation around making it an easy developer experience to build and also onboarding users with very simple semantics like ZK login, sponsored transactions, things that just make it feel like more of a Web 2 experience than anything else. Separately, we also believe gaming is going to be the biggest hook to bring users into Web 3. We actually think DeFi itself is not really a product. DeFi is a piece of infrastructure. Games all have the concept of ownership. They have the concept of transfers. And the idea of being able to own an asset, trade an asset, are all things that you do within a game. But now, you don''t have to rebuild that infrastructure as a game dev moving forward. DeFi is going to power the future of gaming. And to cover that even more, we are so bullish on gaming that we announced the launch of the 3Play 0x1. So before going about 3Play 0x1, can we play the video on games as well? So the thing about games in Web 3 we''ve seen mostly are normally just not fun games. It''s really kind of interesting, what we call spreadsheets that are made to look like games. But now we have top studios building on SWE. We''re going to be announcing some major partnerships this year. Studios who build some of the largest games in the world, games that cost $100 million to make, not just the traditional Web 3 games. Beyond that as well, we also have a games console called the 3Play 0x1. This games console effectively allows you to play Steam, Epic games directly from the App Store in addition to Web 3 games. Whether you''re playing a Web 2 or Web 3 game, you''re earning points, you''re earning rewards in a games console as powerful as your PC. The games console has some of the top specs. It''s actually more powerful than the Steam Deck. All your games on Steam Deck, you''ll be able to play directly on the 3Play 0x1. Your PC games as well, you''ll be able to play directly on deck. But more importantly, you can actually take your games with you. And you don''t have to select whether you want to play a Web 2 game or Web 3 game. You can simply have a device that plays all of them in a single device. The device also has an implementation where it''s inbuilt into a wallet with ZK login. So simply by logging into the device, you have a wallet, and you never have to really worry about downloads or anything of that nature. The device is almost sold out. It''s actually in the 3Play stores. You can order one today. I believe they''re NFTs for people who order the device, and they''re all earning some form of rewards over time as well. So to talk about what''s next, I actually want to welcome George. George is our chief scientist. He''s the brains behind a lot of the algorithms we build at Amiston Labs. And he wants to talk a bit more about the future of coordination on SWEET. Thank you. So the Internet has been around for a while, so we all had that experience, right? You visit a website, you read a nice story on the Internet, but then after a month, after six months, after a year, after five years, it disappears, right? Now, what is worse is that this experience now starts being replicated in the Web3 space. You buy an asset, you buy a digital asset, be it an NFT or some digital asset. In many cases, after a few years, the actual bytes, the actual image, the actual digital asset just disappears. And why does that happen? Because it is not actually stored on chain. Most of the Web3 digital assets are actually just a representation of the asset on chain, and the actual asset lives on a traditional cloud. Basically, the funding for that space runs out. It disappears. Even worse so, we actually are facing a situation where you''re trying to use a smart contract. You think that you''re interacting with something that has all the properties that we love about blockchain. It''s immutable. It''s going to be there tomorrow. It is censorship resistant, etc. But then you turn up, basically, after a month, thinking that you''re going to get back access to your assets, and you realize that the website that represented, let''s say, the user interface to that dApp is gone. Now, we can''t really realize the future that, Adini, you described, we are out to realize, namely reinventing the Internet to make it permissionless, to make it high assurance, and only actually having representations of assets on chain. What we need is to make sure that the actual data that dApps use, either for the media, or for the UX, or for the actual logic of the application on the web, also has the same properties as the contracts and the data on chain. Namely, you can trust that it will be there. You can trust that it is what basically was uploaded, and you can trust that, you know, you will be able to use it tomorrow. For this reason, the second protocol that Mistin Labs is initiating is called Walrus, and it is a security-centralized storage protocol. And with Walrus, basically what you can do is you can bring on chain and have the same properties for the blob data, namely the images, the media, the website that, you know, drives the dApp, as basically for the data that your smart contract is handling on chain. Now, Walrus is built on SWE, and I will talk a little bit about that because Walrus is the best example so far in my mind about what we mean when we say that SWE is a coordination layer. So let''s talk a little bit about how Walrus relates to SWE. We built SWE so that you can actually easily create decentralized dApps, right? And Walrus is just an example of such a dApp. So Walrus adds storage nodes to the universe of SWE. So there is basically a universe of storage nodes, but all of the coordination of the storage nodes, namely who they are, how they get paid, you know, how they change over time, what kind of media, what kind of files, what kind of, what is stored on them, all of that is coordinated through smart contracts on SWE. So what the result of that is that a lot of basically the storage on Walrus can be controlled through smart contracts and can actually be linked with all of the rest of the stuff that happens on SWE, including the DeFi, including all the other assets that are dealt on SWE. So now you can start having this kind of mixed experiences where on one side you have rich media. So for example, if you''re building a ticketing application, you can actually have a ticket that has images, that has, you know, original graphics, etc. All of that is stored on Walrus, but that interacts with the logic of the ticketing, the payments, who has access to it, transferability, etc. That basically is still done on SWE. So now we have extended the realm of DApps, not just into dealing with metadata just on the SWE chain, but actually with the actual data that lives on Walrus. Now, let me tell you a little bit about Walrus under the hood because to some extent there are other decentralized storage networks, but Walrus does a few things better than competitors that are available out there. First of all, Walrus does not actually store files as copies on many machines, but instead it uses what is known as erasure coding. In erasure coding, what you do is you take your file, you encode it into something that is four or five times bigger, and then you store chunks of that encoded file on every node in the network. What does that mean? First of all, what it means is that the overhead that you pay for storing a file is actually quite low. It''s only four to five times bigger what you store in the network than the file itself. But what you really get is a very high degree of resilience. Namely, any one-third of the storage nodes can actually disappear or stop responding, and you can still continue writing files into Walrus, or up to two-thirds can basically stop responding and disappear, and you can still read files in the network. And all of that you can do at the cost of just storing five times more data than you would store before. So this is very economic, it keeps the cost down, and it provides extreme resilience against failures to make sure that the files are there the next day. Now, the second thing that we really leverage with Walrus is that the economics of storage and the technology of storage has different economics than, let''s say, blockchains, right? In blockchains, the more validators you usually add to a blockchain, the capacity stays the same. In fact, the capacity may go down because there is more overhead in coordinating all of those validators with each other. Walrus, however, has very different dynamics because the more storage nodes you add to Walrus, the more disk capacity there is that you can use to store more data, and the more bandwidth there is to be able to write data and read data from Walrus. So, in fact, the economics are very elastic, as Denny mentioned, namely, the more we need to store and the more we need to do input-output into Walrus, the more machines we can add and automatically, basically, we increase the capacity of the system, which is pretty sweet. As I already mentioned, Walrus has a deep integration into SWE, and SWE allows you to control pretty much all aspects of Walrus. You can control, of course, the currency that is used to buy storage. Storage resources are these intelligent resources and intelligent assets that, I didn''t think you mentioned, you can split them, you can merge them, you can trade them. once you basically don''t need to store stuff anymore, you can sell it off to a secondary market. It really is something that belongs to you. Storage can just be bought and it''s yours, right? I mean, you can basically use it as if literally you bought a hard disk. So that''s quite a new paradigm out there. And, of course, you can control all aspects of the lifecycle of files that are stored on Walrus. You can control how their lifetime is extended, you can expand their space, you can delete them, and all of that can be done embedded in smart contracts that control the logic of all of that. So, for example, you can say, look, I''ll build an auditing app and it has a particular retention policy that is encoded in a smart contract and all of that is going to be taken care by the SWE security system and enforced on the Walrus site. Finally, with Walrus, we are trying to release some, you know, best-of-breed initial apps. The first one that will go out as soon as Walrus, well, that is already out on Testnet is what we call Walrus site. Walrus site basically tries to deliver the promise of the internet from back in the 90s and the 2000s. What you can do is you can just basically point to a folder that contains a website. It basically gets stored in Walrus and now you can start browsing it using its normal web browser. No need for wallet, no need for any special browser. It just appears on the internet as far as you''re concerned. And that now has high integrity, high availability, and auditability about the changes of the website. The second technology we''re going to roll out soon is called Seal. And with Seal, you can actually not just store public information on Walrus, but you can actually enforce access control. It uses an encryption technology that allows you to encrypt the file or parts of files that you upload in Walrus. And then it allows smart contracts to determine who has the right to access the keys to decrypt the file. Now that means that suddenly we can encode experiences relating to, for example, the content industry or the creator industry. You can upload an article, let''s say, where the first paragraph is in clear, the rest of the article is encrypted, and then upon a payment on the blockchain, on SWE, you can basically get the key, decrypt the rest of the article and display the whole thing. So it allows suddenly the realm of smart contracts to provide conditional access to data and enable all of the use cases that we''ve seen Web2 covering, but without the assurance that these technologies provide. Now, to some extent, the reason we''re building the whole SWE ecosystem and we''re augmenting the SWE ecosystem with Walrus is not just to serve the Web3 needs that we see today, right? We believe that some of the technologies we''re building and some of the properties that Walrus and SWE provide together can really be used to solve important things in the world, right? So, for example, charities have a need to demonstrate that the funding they get, the donations they get, really represent impact on the world. We didn''t really have a very good way of actually doing that in the Web3 space. With Walrus, what they can do is they can upload media, reports, videos, both themselves and others about the work they do. And then, because of the tight integration with Web3 and the SWE blockchain, you can basically have DAOs that determine funding that actually direct the funding to the different charities depending on basically what media they have shared and what kind of evidence you can see. So, suddenly, you can create these richer experiences that are all integrated in decentralized system using both Walrus and SWE. Similarly, we now have, within reach, experiences relating to more traditional social media, let''s say, right? You can have fans going to a sports event, recording the moment, sharing it socially with each other, with pictures, with videos, et cetera. And then, you can actually have brands that observe all of this activity on Walrus and SWE that reward fan engagement with VIP tickets or collectibles or tokens or whatever in order to actually have a direct relationship with their fan base. again, you use both Walrus for the media and the kind of, you know, bulk data and SWE in order to actually control the collectibles and the passes, et cetera. Finally, something that is very close to my heart is decentralized science. Science should be something that has high integrity, that everybody can trust and that is open to everybody and yet, today, let''s face it, it is really behind closed doors or it is controlled by a cartel, effectively, of publishers that doesn''t really let results flow as freely as possible. Now, again, one could think of a world where we combine Walrus and SWE in order to improve that. You can have scientists registering their experimental protocols, the results of their experiments, even their papers on Walrus because this is all big data, we can''t just record it on a blockchain. and then the blockchain being used, again, as part of the review process that can be open and as part of actually directing funding to different projects that seem more promising than others in order to actually improve the scientific literature out there and the results humanity relies on. Now, all of this is aspirational and I hope that folks can go out there and be, you know, try to build some of that but in practice we already have a very healthy ecosystem of partners that are working with us to build specific things. So, for example, Ethereum is building an app that is streaming music and the music is, of course, stored on Walrus and all of the payments and the rights controls and the access controls are done on SWE. So, again, we have SWE effectively acting as a coordination layer both for the data that is on Walrus but also for the logic by which who can access what data. We''re also working with OneChampionship and they''re using Walrus, again, to store media relating to their martial arts brands and SWE, again, for doing fan engagement in relation to basically that media. Talus is also a very interesting partner of ours. They basically build AI agents that interact with the blockchain and, again, they use Walrus both to store their models, store their inferences, store their data sets and, of course, they interact with SWE in order to optimize particular things that the agent is asked to optimize. Tusky is a partner of ours that takes the basic technology around Walrus and Seal and builds an equivalent, let''s say, cloud folder for people to store their data and be able to actually share their data. You can put up your files, you can share them with friends, you can share them with family or you can publish them using both SWE and Seal and Walrus. Decrypt is the well-known crypto media site and they basically use Walrus as part of their story to make sure that if basically their main website goes down, the media, basically, they have created remains available and you can still read it and, you know, they cannot be suffering from other failures or censorship in their infrastructure. And finally, Arkham is a partner that works in the space of security of blockchains and analytics of blockchains. They look at blockchains, they do monitoring, etc. And they are going to be publishing on Walrus datasets about basically the trustworthiness of addresses, the trustworthiness of transactions, etc. This is big data. You could not just store it on chain before. Now it''s going to be available on the decentralized store that is built by Walrus. So, by all means, Walrus is today at kind of like a testnet phase. We have already a network with over 100 nodes. We are doing tests around how it scales and its performance. You are already able to bring up Walrus sites, store resources, read resources, write smart contracts on the sweet testnet that exercise all the functions that I''m actually mentioning here. We''re observing some very impressive results where you can upload at the rate of hundreds of megabytes and download at the rate of hundreds of megabytes data. And we have about a petabyte of storage already on testnet. But the interesting news is that very soon we''re actually going to be going into mainnet. And we hope that this is going to be happening in March. So join us and use it and build on it. Thank you. Thank you.', 'Adni Abiodun All right, my name is Adni Abiodun.

Because you can mislay it. I thought you wanted to do a decentralization experiment. Oh, I know. Really? Something like that. Okay, we''re back on track. Thank you very much. Welcome, Consensus Hong Kong. Having been to two Consensuses in Austin, it''s great to have it here in this city and with this distinguished panel. I won''t introduce them. I''m sorry if I interrupted you all trying to introduce yourselves. Their roles and their companies are up there behind us. And let''s just dive in. And I''d love to hear from this audience how many of you use AI on a daily basis or very regularly? See hands going up, either for work or for personal life. So that''s great. I mean, I think the adoption is going very fast. Just two years after chat GPT rolled out. How many of you are familiar with decentralized AI? Which is our topic? DAI. Okay, a few more. Thank you for that. So today we want to demystify this a little bit and talk about why it matters. And we have a great lineup here to go into that topic. Let''s first say what it is not. And sometimes when you mention decentralized AI, people think, oh, it''s like DeepSeq. DeepSeq, I''m sure the whole room has heard about already. And DeepSeq is, of course, an open source version, a model. So some of the things that they use to describe decentralized AI, and this is why I needed my notes because I didn''t memorize this, is that decentralized AI operates on a distributed, not a centralized network. The idea behind it is similar to blockchain, right? So you distribute power, control, and network participants make the decisions. It''s not some central body controlling all of that. There''s a way for users to benefit from it, too. They can benefit from their contributions to the network. And you might wonder how big is this. I mean, the title of our panel is David versus Goliath. And as you can guess, we are David, not Goliath, yet. But PitchBook says that AI startups raised more money last year than in the previous three years combined. This was $436 million. So getting up there, you know, and getting into a real force of nature here. So let''s bring in the panel. I''d like to hear from each of you who you think the Goliath is. We''ve established that we''re the David. Why does DAI matter? And I''m going to start with Scott. I think that''s actually a really good question. Why does DAI matter? My answer for this is that depends on what you''re talking about for decentralized AI. I think end-to-end transparency is the only thing that matters here. What does end-to-end transparency here mean? For example, nowadays, Apple cannot use DeepSeq. Apple cannot use OpenAI because they don''t know what''s behind it. Even though they may say, hey, maybe a million data points behind it is actually a really good data point. But it just takes one poisoning data point to actually make things completely go wrong in this case. So that''s why when I talk about decentralized AI, I won''t talk about end-to-end transparency in this case. And there is another discussion about decentralized AI. For example, last year, there was a paper published by DeepMind, you know, the local and DeepPaco. What does that mean? That means that instead of training AI in a centralized data center, you can break down the training process into a smaller batch. You know, each batch could be like a, you know, just a few parabytes of flop, etc. You can break down to a smaller trunk and train it to our sphere. But I don''t think this matters because at the end of the day, the algorithm don''t matter. You know, the very train model doesn''t matter. The data actually matters. This reminds me, really, you know, I worked at Uber for five years. I was Uber Engineering Committee for a year and a half, just supervised all the engineering design at Uber. At that time, Uber was delivering Uber Eats competing with DoorDash. The DoorDash guys focus on, they realize the most important thing is what food, what restaurant to deliver. The delivery guy doesn''t matter. But Uber is focused on, in this case, actually, hey, how can I deliver it faster? Two minutes faster, three minutes faster. That thing doesn''t matter. So that''s why, you know, you can see a clearly difference between DoorDash market cap with Uber market cap, just on Uber Eats part. So I think, again, at the end of the day, what matters is end-to-end transparency. Where the data come from, what''s actually behind the model for the data and where the data go to. That''s what Kite AI actually built for, bring end-to-end transparency to the model and the data behind the model. Thank you. Ellen, if we could bring you into this discussion, what''s your thoughts on it? Sure. I think decentralized AI is a very important part of AI development right now because I think we''re getting dangerously close to what happened in Web2. We all live in the Web2 world where the Google and Facebook and Instagram of the world has monopolized our data. And we''re milking users, but without giving us any benefit, right? And I think AI is getting dangerously close to that because with, you know, OpenAI and Google and Meta, you know, even though some of those are open source. But, you know, no one gets to benefit from the value that we actually contribute and create. And, of course, there are lots of lawsuits around copyrights, around what data actually went into the model. So we''re heading down a pretty dangerous path until, I think, when there is a movement from Web3 trying to integrate with AI. And that brings us to decentralized AI, right? So the idea is, you know, it is trying to solve a couple of what I''m calling Web2 AI problems. We all know that we don''t have enough processing power. We don''t have enough chips. We don''t have data sovereignty. There is not enough incentive for people to share data, to share the models they''ve created. And these are all the problems in Web2 AI that we''re trying to solve with decentralized AI, right? And Animoca in that process has invested in quite a number of these companies trying to solve the problem. Yeah, I hear what you''re saying. I mean, it''s sort of the old saying where, you know, the users are being used, you know, rather than being able to profit from things that they were putting into the system. Sam Altman, I guess, famously said perhaps that what fuels AI is data, money, and chips. I don''t know if it boils down to that in a simple way. Maybe we have to add blockchain or a system where it''s decentralized. But on that note, perhaps we could bring in CK. So the Goliaths obviously will point to Sam Altman and, you know, basically people who try to monopolize AI. Because what OpenAI tried to do, but thankfully, you know, open source labs kind of countered it, is, you know, to build a frontier model, gatekeep, you know, who can have access to those models, not share their research findings, and, you know, build a very profitable monopoly out of it. You know, thankfully, DeepSeek and, you know, other open source labs, they show that actually open source can catch up to it. And, you know, that''s why I would say those that, not just those who have resources, but those who actively try to slow down the development of open source labs by monopolizing the ideas, you know, the research findings are the Goliaths. And I think decentralized AI matters not just because of, you know, transparency reasons, but also because we want everyone to have access to, you know, the latest and the greatest AI. AI has the potential to either be something that is very empowering for everyone, or something that, you know, empowers a very small group of people and make them even, you know, make the disparity between the haves and haves-nots even greater. But thankfully, you know, the DeepSeek moment is very powerful, not just because it shows that China can actually innovate as well, but also because it allows anyone to download the model and run it on, you know, a local computer, a local system, which, you know, means, you know, probably the centralized AI labs have to realize they are not on the right side of history, as Sam Ormond has said. But DAI and open source AI is quite different because, for example, not everyone here can just contribute to DeepSeek because they want to. But DAI means, you know, there''s an open system where people compete on merits. In the ideal world of DAI, which has not honestly happened yet, because the tech is not ready, everyone can contribute data to AI, everyone can contribute compute to AI and make money, and everyone can own a piece of those AI systems, maybe through network tokens. And that''s the world, you know, the ideal DAI world, which I think, you know, people here are either building towards or investing towards. Actually, I second CK''s opinion here, because the current open source is actually not, you know, equal to the open source in data infrared operating system. Current open source is just open source-based. It''s like, I allow you to copy this a million times to deploy, but you don''t know what''s actually behind. But the open source, we''re traditionally talking about, like, an operating system, you know, the data infrastructure, in this case, you actually can''t reproduce. It''s like an end-to-end reproduce and transparency here. And then, so that''s why I think when we talk about DAI, again, in order to make sure, push AI adoption to the next level, the goal is actually to have end-to-end transparency. In this case, you don''t need to publish your algorithm. That''s maybe your secret part. But end-to-end transparency from data to model is very important. Thanks for that. I''m sure there are businesses represented in this room, maybe from the Web2 world. Some of you are startup folks. Some of you are entrepreneurs. Some of you are just trying to learn about this. If you''re speaking to businesses in general who are struggling with the almost every day there''s something new in the AI world, or, you know, it feels hard to keep up with everything, what would be your suggestion for some of the use cases? I mean, how useful is this? Because it''s great to be wowed by all the new stuff that comes out, right? All the shiny stuff, the shiny new objects. How do you use it? And maybe we can start with Alan to talk about it because you''ve got a wide sort of lens on this. You deal with so many different companies and the Animoca portfolio. I can talk about two extreme ends, right? I think this is a room of people that are tech forward and progressive. And, you know, when it comes to the merge of AI and Web3, we''re seeing a lot of use cases, right? So, you know, of course, the big step change is with AI agent, right? So if you think about what LRM is something that tells you the answer, AI agent is something that does things for you. An AI agent with a crypto wallet is something that can complete the task because, you know, the agent can buy, can trade, can sell, right? Once you give it the ability to own and use financial resources, there''s so many more tasks that they can complete, right? So I think that is, you know, I think this is all the way out there at the frontier on what is possible. So in terms of adoption, we''ve seen different stages, right? A couple of months ago, we''ve seen AI agents that are like YouTubers, right? They''re doing broadcasts 24-7. She gets tips from people, that''s how she makes money. But she also figured out, actually, that she can use crypto to buy users, right? So you can really see, you know, intelligence there. So, you know, that''s one stage. And then later on, we''ve seen quite a lot of use cases around decentralized finance, putting AI agent, giving them an objective function and say, this is the risk I''m willing to take. So help me optimize my portfolio, make as much money as possible. And then most recently, we, of course, you know, as Animoku, we see a lot of use cases in AI gaming as well, right? So imagine, I think many of you have played different type of games. Previously, in RPG, you know, you would go approach a bartender, and you can only do three things. You can talk to him, you can order a beer, you can walk away. But now you can approach him. And in natural language, you can have a conversation, and there''s so many more scenarios and possibility within a game, right? So we''re building both, you know, these AI agents into the game and also the infrastructure to support it, right? So I would say within this group and, you know, within a cohort of people on the AI and web-free frontier, you know, these are the use cases. I also have some visibility on the other end of the extreme because you mentioned corporate, right? And I think a lot of traditional corporate are still struggling to figure out how to get ROI from AI, right? And I had the privilege of sitting on some of these boards, you know, US listed company, and oftentimes it''s not the tech. It''s actually the culture that hold people back, right? So the idea that, you know, of course, all of them are using ChatGPT or Cloud or whatever, right? But, you know, if you had a strong compliance culture, it is very difficult to figure out some of the question that you mentioned, right? Which is, well, how do I make sure that what''s in the model is correct? How do I make sure that it is not hallucinating? You know, do I allow the AI to directly interact with the customers, right? So it really is a culture on whether they want to lean forward to adopt and also whether they want to trust and empower employees, right? So those are, that is a very different set of conversations I''m having with traditional companies versus I think what we''re doing here, which is really at a frontier. Yeah. CK, if I could bring you into this, TensorFlow Plex, you know, how do you see this shaking up in terms of what is it used for? I mean, we understand the principles of it, the ethos of it, the benefits of it, but what''s the actual use case? You mean use case for AI or decentralized AI? DAI. I see. Yeah. So I''d like to first start with the usefulness of AI, which seems already obvious, but I''ve, like, these few days, every time I meet my friends, crypto friends or non-crypto friends, I''m telling everyone to use AI, experiment with the latest models. OpenAI''s O3 deep research is life-changing because, okay, let me first talk about O3, despite I''m shitting on Sam Altman just now. OpenAI''s O3 deep research costs $200 a month, but it''s equivalent to having PhD-level analysts that can write reports on whatever topic you want to learn more about at 100 times the speed. And I think this service is worth a lot more than $200 per month if you had someone to ask questions and think about things. But, of course, ideally, I don''t want everyone to be paying to open AI, so, you know, I hope DAI comes in handy. And the way I think people will use DAI in the future, as the tech becomes more ready, is, you know, to save costs. So, transparency matters a lot, as, you know, both Alan Scott mentioned. But I think what makes decentralized AI worth it, because, you know, we can''t convince companies that you should use DAI because the ideology, despite it, costs more. But DAI has definitely the potential to be cheaper and more efficient than traditional Web2.ai. Because if you look at, let''s use Bitcoin mining as an example. Bitcoin mining managed to, you know, lead to people globally trying to find the cheapest source of electricity in the world because, you know, they want to make money and they want to save money to make more profits. And I think DAI can have a similar impact when, you know, it can enable the resources that are not utilized, including the electricity and the compute, to be used to provide AI inference services. I think Jensen mentioned that in the next few years, the demand for AI inference will probably grow 1,000x because everyone will realize how powerful AI is and they want to use it. And at some point, you know, when DAI technology is ready, it will make a lot of sense that, you know, when you use AI, you''re using the spare GPUs that maybe some of your neighbor''s, you know, home GPU can provide. So I think this will definitely happen. And that''s the direction a lot of us are pushing towards. Because in crypto, a lesson that I''ve learned is that talking about decentralization, talking about, you know, the important privacy ethos, a lot of times it doesn''t work out. Because most people don''t care about privacy and they don''t even know what is decentralization. So why would they use the AI for the sake of it? So I think ultimately it''s a competition on, you know, cost and, you know, the ROI, basically. So it sounds like an Airbnb kind of like for compute powers. You spare compute power, you''re going to rent it out or something. Like the spare room in your house. If we could bring in Scott and your thinking about use cases, why is it relevant to businesses, why they should pay attention? Sure. Actually, both the academic industry and the AI industry are sick of the LLM. Like in this case, you know, if you ask any researcher, they''re probably not going to top research. They don''t want to research LLM. But I do saw three major use case directions. I''m going to break through. So one of my classmates actually lead NVIDIA robotic research lab in this case. And then that''s the robotic part is actually one of them. The reason is that think about the autonomous driving. You know, before the gen AI part, autonomous driving is perception model, planning model, which is the most powerful head, and action. Action is always a simple part. It''s just a perception model and a planning model. Because there is no gen AI, there is a lot of counter cases. You just cannot, you know, cover all the counter cases. If the light actually changes, it''s a counter case. If it''s a work on a strange street, it''s a counter case. In this case, the planning is always make some mistake in this case, actually. You know, that happened in 2009. Uber autonomous driving actually caused a fatal accident. That''s actually, I was there, you know, that''s a disaster. Wow. But with gen AI, now you have a very smart foundational model that can help you do planning. It can reason and use common sense to make the right planning. So that''s why in the last year and a half, there is actually a great breakthrough in autonomous driving because now you can actually delegate the planning part to the foundation model. And this foundation model can be very smart. Even though it didn''t match this counter case or edge case, but it can make the decision using the common sense, which train from millions of data points. So currently, it''s not algorithm is blocking us for autonomous driving or any other robotic. It''s just we don''t have enough data. We just need to collect enough data, you know, like a foundational model is like this. It''s thirsty for tons of data. We just need to collect all the data to fit into the foundation model and build the planning part really well. And then I think the newest trend is that end-to-end foundational model. You even get rid of perception model, end-to-end foundational model to do from perception to the planning, to the action. But I think this year will be birth year for robotic. You''re going to see a lot of the robotic use case pop-up. Most important thing is use case because I think about DeepSeq. The reason DeepSeq has a great work through is basically due to some pre-training and almost skip the supervised fine-tuning direct to reinforced learning because reinforced learning produces much, much better result. And then it depends on use case. If you have a well-controlled, you know, in this case, full information use case, you can reinforce learning a very, you know, precise model and handle this correctly. So in this case. So that''s why I think robotic is around the direction. I''m really super excited. I think this will be birth year for robotic. The second direction I can see is that we currently work with UC Berkeley to do the cancer detection. The currently UC Berkeley get a lot of the cancer detection medical data. This is not like a small photo. For example, we work with blood cancer detection. This is 200K times 200K photos. Each photo could be anywhere between 2 gigabytes to 4 gigabytes. And then how they do is that they break down the photo to different segment and use AI to recommend train a foundational model to recognize per blood cell if this is a cancer cell or not in this case. So that''s why there is some fundamental, you know, model like a train from, you know, Harvard just published a publication last year, fundamental model for medical use case. Currently, there is no technical difficulty. It''s just a need to, you know, go through this long process. You don''t need to go FDA for the cancer detection, but still a long process in this case to go through to production. But I think this actually technical part, there is no blocker in this case. The third part I saw is multi-modal data, multi-modal model. I''m talking about a creator digital twins. There is, you know, one of my founder friend is building an audio model. In this case, I''m just talking to his model model for more than two minutes. The audio model can sound exactly like me in this case. Well, you may not think like me, but it can sound exactly like me. Think about it in this case. For every single creator, you''ll have a digital twin for you and help you to answer your friends'' question. This is actually some breakthrough. I think forecasting this year will be a birth year for this digital twin for the creator. I think that''s a three direction I''m really looking forward to. But all of them are blocked by data. I think data is like 90 or 95% of AI in this case. Can I add to that? Data, chips, and money, right? Yeah. But please, please, please go in. So I just want to pick up that last point. You know, we had a brief conversation about this last night, which is, yes, the technology is there. You can train someone''s voice and, you know, you can talk to, you know, and then they can, your twin can talk instead of you, right? But, again, technology moves much faster than culture, right? So the recent example was actually in a Hollywood movie called The Brutalist, which is a major Oscar contender. And because the language is in Hungarian. So the artist was trying to speak, the actor was trying to speak in Hungarian, but he didn''t quite get the accent right. So they train his voice into the LLM. And then, you know, basically what he said on the movie was his AI voice. But then there was a major backslash in Hollywood saying, how could you do that, right? Because that''s not art, right? So it''s quite interesting to see, while there''s a lot of application when it comes to creativity and how we actually get into the real world, I think there''s still a lot of discomfort or mistrust on how the technology should be used. But, you know, hopefully it''s something that we''ll be able to sort out in the next year. I mean, the confluence between the humans and AI, the bots will continue for some time. And I want to go to CK to ask about TensorPlex''s dojo, which empowers humans to contribute to AI and collaborate. I think the role is evolving. I think we all agree that the human role is evolving as AI grows more and more powerful. How do you see that headed? I mean, what''s sort of the interplay between humans and AI? Yeah, I think the future of work is something worth thinking about because I think right now a lot of people, including myself, we still work in a full-time job model, right? Yep. It''s kind of like our company has a full-time subscription of our time supposedly, like when we''re in office. True. But I think we''re heading towards a world where this makes even less sense. I think even now it doesn''t make much sense because it''s basically an industrial revolution model where it''s like we''re all in factories. But in fact, you know, I think a lot of work we do is more task-based than time-based. We''re not working in factories anymore. And going forward, what''s going to happen is that AI becomes more and more powerful. AI agents become autonomous, which means AI agents probably can replace most of us when it comes to just doing tasks that people give us in order to do. So I think what will happen going forward include, you know, humans will become like a board of director for AI agents. It has a task. Maybe this AI agent is a company, which means, you know, there will be companies where there are no people. It''s just an AI. But there should be a board of director supervising what the AI is doing. How is it getting, you know, the job done? Because if there''s a company where, you know, the AI''s only job is to make money, maybe it goes to do scams or meme coins instead of doing something productive. And you want people to be giving oversight to it. And also humans will be working for AI agents because there''s still a lot of stuff that, you know, AI agents, I think even in a few years cannot do. They cannot get a driving license. Maybe they don''t need to, but they won''t be able to get it. They may not be able to register, you know, a company or sign a rental contract in real life. And it probably cannot easily direct someone to help pick up goods, maybe. So AI agents will be hiring people on a task basis. And, you know, this is quite exciting as well. So what we do with, you know, a flagship product for TensorFlow. You can learn more on Twitter. Is we are doing a decentralized human-in-the-loop protocol. Basically, for AI to work with people or get insights or work done by people in a decentralized way. Basically, we want, you know, tasks to not be, you know, gatekeep from people. And we hope people globally through the platform and technology we''re building will be able to work for AI and compete based on merit instead of, you know, by, you know, who their identity is. But yeah, I don''t want to take too much time. We don''t have much time left. But you can learn more on Twitter at TensorFlow Labs. Thank you. Alan, I want to come to you because Yatsue is known for talking a lot about property rights, user rights. How do you see this in the context of, you know, DAI? Does DAI enhance these rights? I mean, if everything belongs to everyone, so to speak, what belongs to the individuals? Yeah, I think this is squarely in digital property rights because, you know, as I think both CK and Scott has mentioned, right now, there isn''t really a place where you can contribute, compute or contribute data and own it and monetize it, right? So this is around, this is really about claiming sovereignty and having the ability to monetize it, right? So it''s, you know, similar, you know, very different than NFTs in some way, but very similar in terms of the ethos. Okay. Scott, I want to come to you to talk about Kite AI and, you know, how it aims to unlock, you know, fair access to AI assets using this whole decentralized system. How do you ensure data privacy? Because I handled a panel earlier today that talked a lot about trust, which is a very big deal still. And I don''t know if being decentralized already adds a layer of trust or not necessarily. Can people get a little bit too complacent because they think, well, it''s decentralized and I have more control over my data and over my information. Yeah, that''s a good question. I will take back to the previous example I mentioned, you know, Berkeley is a training of blood cancer detection model. Currently, they only have access to UCSF data. But Kite AI provides a lot of data subnet. Actually, one of the subnet actually can provide university data, Renji University hospital data, you know, blood cancer, blood cell data for them to use. But the data has jurisdiction. You know, U.S. data cannot leave U.S. China data cannot leave China. So there are several ways to actually do this. In this case, there are three major ways to do it. Each of them has a lot of populations here. The most simple way is that you train the foundational model during the jurisdiction. You know, you''re just a shared with foundation model. In this case, no data privacy will ever leave your space, you know, your protected space. This is one way. The second way is that instead of sharing the data with privacy, you''re sharing embedding vectors. You can think of this as a high-dimensional vector you can share. This has, you know, no personal information inside, no privacy in this at all. In this case, you can share this embedding vector to help the model train. That''s the second approach I saw. The third part is that this is also, you know, the UC Berkeley is doing with UCSF and another company here. Is that you share digital twin data. You''re synthetic data. You use the data. You learn a lot of patterns. You share digital twin and synthetic data. In this case, you''re not violating the privacy. I think the most important thing, when people ask me, like, how can I contribute data? How can I earn money from data, you know, reward from data? The most important thing I often ask is what data in this case. I think personally speaking, if you''re just to say, hey, I want to contribute all my writing data, all my handwriting data, etc. The, you know, the current large language model is built on top of 50 years internet-based data, you know, like Wikipedia, all the publishing, all the Reddit forum data. In this case, individuals'' writing data is actually contribute less. The most valuable data, actually, from my perspective, from each person, is DNA data, in this case. DNA data is the most valuable data, in this case. And then second most probably just all the multimodal data, you know, like audio data, video data, in this case. So, in this case, you know, maybe we can, you know, like data in this part, this is probably into the future. Maybe we can just remove all the personal information, remove sensitive information. So, when the data be part of the database to train foundational model later, there is no personal information to this. And maybe it''s even data aggregated because you need the raw data, process the data, aggregate data to do training, in this case. So, remove all the personal information. So, I think there are multiple ways to do it. And, honestly speaking, as a builder, as an AI builder, you know, I built a foundational data and AI infrastructure for the last 15 years. I really don''t need your privacy data. I just need the data to train the model. Yeah, you don''t need it. Exactly. I hear you. CK, if you can, besides telling people to check your Twitter or your X account, yes, let''s do that. Can you give us one thing for the audience to take away? Because, at the start, we asked how many people were familiar with DAI and not that many hands went up. So, if you want to now sort of reinforce the point, what''s the one thing you would like the audience to walk away knowing about this? I think, honestly, first and foremost, it''s worth everyone''s time to think about, you know, to learn what''s latest happening in AI. And, Twitter is actually the best place to learn about AI before we talk about the AI. Experiment with using the applications or even building your own. Because, right now, I think there are no excuses for people anymore to not get stuff done. Because, AI basically means you have your own team of very smart people working for you, coding for you. And, then, for DAI, honestly, follow, you know, again, closely follow Twitter. See what''s happening across the AI ecosystems. I think BitTense is the most exciting one. And, many people like DCG is very silver, agree. And, you know, there are also other exciting developments coming. But, yeah, I think the most important takeaway for everyone, I hope, is use AI and there are no more excuses to not make your vision a reality or find out about whatever you want to learn more about. Because, AI can write the report for you. I''m going to give Alan the final word, Alan. So, what''s the one thing? Right. Know your rights and know that there is an opportunity for you to own your compute, to own your data, to own your model. And, you have your say on how you can monetize it, right? So, I think we''ve seen the story happening and happened in Web 2.1 already. So, don''t let it happen in AI, which is going to be a really important transformational change for us. As I said, for my first panel, no artificial intelligence here. All natural intelligence and natural talents, clearly. So, thank you very much, my great panel. Thank you, audience, for listening to us. And, I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference. Thank you. Thank you, everyone. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('defi_meets_institutions__building_trust_and_infrastructure_on_sui', 'DeFi Meets Institutions_ Building Trust and Infrastructure on Sui', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' SAM KESSLER- SAM KESSLER- Hello, everybody. Thank you so much for joining us. I''ll do a little introduction while people are filtering in and out. My name is Sam Kessler. I''m a journalist here at CoinDesk, and I''m really excited to be joined here by Evan Chang from SWE, which is a blockchain that doubtless all of you here at this panel have heard about. We''re going to talk about a bunch. We don''t have a ton of time, so I kind of just want to jump into it. Well, first off, Evan, thank you so much for joining us. Evan Chang- It''s great to be here. Thanks for coming to Hong Kong. You said it was your first time. It''s a far way to travel from San Francisco, so I really appreciate it. So in the lead up to this panel, I was talking to Evan and his team about what are the sorts of things that we can cover. And they referred me to an article that you wrote recently. You shared it on Twitter, X. And it was about can''t be evil technology, the idea of building infrastructure that can''t be evil, obviously stemming from Google''s don''t be evil moniker. Tell me a little bit about that and kind of how SWE, what it is, and how that works into that whole thesis. I mean, it''s a recognition of what the current Web2 business model. We were seeing the bigger gets bigger. And the way they get bigger and bigger, because they''re essentially gatekeeper. They''re handling customer data, customer assets, customer secrets. And it sort of becomes the gatekeeper and the network fact take hold. And the monetization model is always somehow extracting the value from the customer. And you have to trust it. Right? Yeah. So this is come down to trust. Yeah. So the, but taking a step back, right? That just feels wrong. Right? Yeah. You know, this is not what internet was about. From the very beginning, it''s about even in playing field. How do we come here? It turns out it is really, really hard to build products and services that sort of like not try to extract value and not try to leverage the power of having that hoard of information, the data. And so it''s leading us to that point. And frankly, this is the opportunity for these industries, building the kind of tools and infrastructure to allow business transformation to go away from that business model. Now, now a core part of that article and that idea of vision that you laid out wasn''t just about how crypto is, of course, a solution to this. Don''t be evil. Can''t be evil sort of dichotomy, but sweet in particular, and maybe in contrast to other crypto firms in your view or, you know, blockchains is better poised. Yeah. Of course, your opinion, what you''re building to actually build that kind of can''t be evil technology. So what differentiates, you know, SWE and other blockchains like it from, you know, maybe you can name names. These can be evil blockchains that are still trying to solve this same problem. So it comes down to ultimately where do you place the trust? And if the blockchain is not built correctly, we''re seeing examples of other blockchain that fall back to a centralized solution. So, well, let''s, you know, we can talk about SWE all day. I can talk about SWE all day. We''ve got 16 minutes. And so frankly, right, it comes down to the enforcement of rules. Yeah. That''s defined by the creator of the asset. And the job of the blockchain is to help basically ensuring those rules are followed without the opportunity for human to come along and circumvent those rules. Right. Right. So the example always used, right, is back in 2021. And everybody''s is trading AFTs and the premises was good where you can create an art and robbing AFT, you sell to someone and that person turns around, sell to someone else. And that royalty payment will somehow come back to the creator. Yeah. That seems like a perfect example of can be evil, except that''s exactly what happened is the marketplace stopped dropping the enforcement of this royalty payments. Yes. And why is that? Because the model is wrong. Yeah. You''re not building it correctly where the rule enforcement cannot be circumvented. Right. So at the highest level, right, at the more general level, that is the fundamental difference is SWE built that way is you cannot do that. Right. This is what I mean by it. Mechanically. Mechanically. Yeah. So each object is essentially its own, you know, its assets is its own object. So this is the move programming language. Well, this is not just move programming language. Okay. It''s a use platform in the programming language. Program language can be used for a different platform. Sure. So the other model is it''s how you... It''s object oriented. Yeah. How do you represent assets, right? In a cloud-based model, you''re basically saying the information about the assets are living inside a smart contract. Yeah. Each asset you can kind of, you know, sort of connect some other states to it. But it''s all in a fairly clumsy way. Sure. If you ever, you know, kind of spending time building developer tools and programming language, you know that feels wrong. You have to have the encapsulation and the rules have to be encoded in a way where the implementation cannot, you know, it forces you to literally say, if you''re not SAM, you cannot pick this up. And I just pick it up that rules enforcement is not there. So it''s a lot of like the data modeling. It''s the unit of computation. Everything has to be built correctly. So we went away from, you know, we saw this and we went away from that account-based model. It''s a lot of, I wish I have a whiteboard to go draw why that cannot be the case. But generally speaking, the in the probably from people familiar with the NFT model ERC 721, you''re not really encoding any rules there. You''re just saying if you follow interface, you follow the standard, you know, but the enforcement is in the code. It''s not in the, you know, whatever it looks like. Yeah. So you mentioned there''s a difference, of course, between platforms and the language move. We''ve kind of brushed over this, but, you know, one of Sui''s, you know, claims to fame is it was one of the first blockchain ecosystems to really implement Facebook''s, you know, DM Libra programming language move. It''s a blockchain programming language. You were at Facebook previously. You worked on this project. It was ill fated at Facebook, but of course it came to life with Sui and another blockchain, blockchains, Aptos and movement, which is a layer two on Ethereum. Bearing in mind that difference between platforms and languages, can you kind of talk to me about the difference between Sui and these other, you know, two and maybe others implementations of Moves programming language? Well, as I say, right, the object-based model where every asset is its own object, right? The states are capturing the object. Sure. And that differentiates Sui from Aptos and movement. That''s a huge difference. Yeah, right. So it''s not a account-based model of blockchain. And one thing I''m just going to talk about in a little bit more detail just to give you a sense. So if the information about the asset does not live on chain, you literally cannot enforce rules around this thing. Sure. Right. So we just say, capture this example. This is the same spot of water and that information has to be on chain for the rules to take place. Right. Yeah. But most other blockchain cannot store much information on chain. Yeah. Right. You heard about this. You''ve seen the NFT standard of most of these blockchains, right? They live off chain, right? You encode a URL where the actual assets are living elsewhere. Yeah. Why is the storage so expensive? Because the way you organize information, organize data is fundamentally incorrect, right? Yeah. So you''re forced to keep this information in a very, very expensive data structure, authenticated data structure, so it costs the on chain storage to be really, really high to the point where you really cannot store any information there. Yeah. So if you can''t do that, there''s a lot of limitation you cannot. Yeah. So this is why, I mean, just like any other platforms out there outside of a, you know, kind of a crypto ecosystem, a lot of times the programming language is shared across a lot of different platform. Sure. But the way you program it, the way you describe logic, encode logics are very, very different. Yeah. So how do you think it''s positive for your ecosystem that you have these competitors, you know, community members? Yeah. I don''t know. How do you kind of view these other chains? Well, so a lot of these chains come out roughly at the same time. Yeah. And why is this three much, much more popular than other? We have a point of view, right? And we have a point of view, we justify our point of view by describing the problem we''re trying to solve and how we''re solving it. Yeah. And it turns out developers love it. They talk about the developer efficiency experience. Yeah. And they can build much more efficient product. The products are more interesting. Yeah. They''re more real on-chain composability, right? If you ever look at, for example, some of these aggregator trading bots and all that, you see a program transaction block that touch 10 different protocol to try to get the best price or arbitrage across a lot of different protocol. People have been talking about, you know, composability for a long time, but it''s real on suite. It''s not really real elsewhere. Yeah. And we can even talk about data composability, even our NFT projects, some of them, that you see the changes as things happen to the object. Yeah. So these things cannot be done on other platform. Yeah. Or they have to fall back to very centralized solution. The off-chain storage was indexed, they''re telling you what the content actually look like. Those are the wrong technologies. Sure. So this is why we took off while most others have not in this cycle. And it''s because we have a very opinion approach to do things and the developer love it, the user love it. Yeah. So SWE has been doing well in terms of volumes and all of that recently. I kind of want to take a step back and kind of talk about the formation of SWE as it is today. You raised a lot of money. I feel like I''m neglecting my duties as a reporter. I don''t have the number in front of me, but it was a lot of money, even by crypto standards. And I''m curious, as somebody who''s leading one of these firms that raised so much from so many large VCs, how does that kind of, and I''m sure there''s other founders in the audience, how does that kind of impact your ability to continue executing? Like, was it difficult, I guess, during that bear market to kind of keep people engaged, keep people enthusiastic while prices were going down? But you, of course, had all of these investors that, you know, were, I''m sure, breathing down your neck. Well, we didn''t have an investor breathing on the neck, right? You know, we fortunately had a lot of trust. You know, the investor had a lot of trust in us and we executed quite well. Yes, during the bear market is pretty rough, but we were able to capture a lot of attention from the developer, from the user community, and that eventually recover, you know, so you end up being the best performing, you know, kind of token among the majors in 2024. Raising a lot of money doesn''t equate to success. We know that. We''re seeing the stories everywhere. Plenty of well-funded startup end up failing to deliver product. And I figure it creates challenges and that''s kind of what I''m curious about as well. Well, we allow us a lot of the flexibility to go out building our business in a very different way. Sure. Right. So a lot of things that''s differentiates us from everyone else is not just in the product and the technology that we build. We also the approach to go about, you know, kind of go to market and attracting people, you know, market our products and keep on building. Right. This is the thing we now doing all. Well, this is just over three years since Boston. Yes. We have delivered SWE, which is the best performing new L1. Sure. We have delivered DBook. It''s also done extremely well. And we are delivering WARS. WARS is the storage protocol. Basically the same team in roughly the same, you know, three years time. Sure. I think in the three years time, most other protocol that raise a lot of money haven''t really delivered anywhere near as much value. Sure. To the investor to everyone else as we have. I mean, going back to the whole don''t be evil, can''t be evil thing. A lot of the focus of your writing on that was around, you know, just decentralization generally. And there were questions in SWE''s early days around token unlocks and, you know, centralized supply. And I''m curious, kind of, how do you frame to people the difference between your consensus mechanism, maybe, to start there, and other proof of stake systems as far as concentrated supply is concerned? Does it have a different sort of model than an Ethereum where a lot of centralized supply doesn''t correlate or does correlate with, you know? So I think people are a little confused about what centralization means, right? Some people think it depends on how many nodes you have, right? How many validators you have, right? And we''re seeing this happen on Ethereum too. A lot of concentration in a few pools, a few validators. And so on. Yeah. Because ultimately it''s about two-thirds majority of the staking power, right? So SWE''s model is not totally unique on that, right? We''re delegated proof of stake. So eventually there''s a lot of concentration in the hands of the foundation, but the foundation delegates. Yeah. Focans to validator and we build and we make protocol changes. They''re now about to drop the requirement to, you know, the staking requirement to be validated on SWE. So we increase the distribution further. Yeah. And other things important to know about our token supply is we''re the one that very, very few that''s fixed supply. Okay. I don''t have, most others have unlock as well as inflation. Yeah. And if you look at the other protocol that launched around the same time, it''s 6% or 7% annual inflection. Yeah. In the early days of protocols, it''s actually a mass amount of inflation on top of the unlocks. So I think there''s a few things people are sort of kind of get mixed up. I mean, one of the, you know, while I have you here, like one of the questions too has been about lock tokens versus stake tokens. So SWE is, you know, far from the only project to be a part of this conversation, but there is a general practice in the industry where tokens will be locked up for investors, but they''ll still be available to stake. Meaning that emissions from the protocol fees and so on still accrue to investors who are theoretically locked and those fees, you know, it can be a lot of money. So I''m kind of curious while I have you here, how do you kind of think about that sort of a model? Is that, I mean, you launched before a lot of these more recent protocols and we''re all experimenting. Yeah. How do you kind of think about that, you know, with the benefit of retrospect? So the most important thing, if you think about modeling, you know, each of the protocol, each of the L1 is sort of economy, right? Economy, then there''s underlying currency and the currency have inflation, right? You can view the unlock as inflationary force. Is this necessary bad? No, because you''re using that money, that, you know, the activity, as long as the economic activity or the gross outstrip your inflation, you have a healthy gross economy. That''s the key thing. We''re able to grow faster than the inflation that doesn''t create problems. So a lot of these fees go back to, say, for example, the validators and some of them go to the investor. And but they can use that money to then add to kind of put it back into the community to help the economy grow faster as a result. So this is this is outcome, right? We''re able to grow very, very quickly in a very modern time because all these economic designs come together. I mean, speaking of the design, how do you guarantee that that money is put back into the ecosystem? There''s no no such a thing as guaranteed. OK, how do you just incentivize that sort of a structure rather than just dumping? That''s that that''s the fear. Well, I mean, by growth, right? If there''s a growth and investments will come in. It''s simple as that. And where is the investment coming? And this is a very, very similar to a lot of economic. Sure. Real world economies like this, right? You have to have make money and an opportunity to make even more money for that money. So you need to set up that flywheel to incentivize people to contribute to the to the ecosystem. Shifting gears a little bit. You, of course, as I mentioned, worked at Facebook. You worked at DM, but it was also called Libra. So maybe we can talk a little bit about the other, you know, elephant in the room, Libra in the room, which is that meme coin that was, you know, backed by Javier Mille of Argentina. Everybody in this audience, I see some smiles, you know, has heard about this. But if you haven''t, it was a meme coin. It was endorsed by the Argentinian president. And it ended up crashing. There''s a lot of, you know, shenanigans going on with the person who launched that meme coin and so on. But it kind of put us in a weird place for the first day of the consensus, you know, conference. And I''m curious to get your reflections as somebody who has a platform that, of course, like all these other platforms, is used by meme coin builders. You know, how do you feel? Like, what is your sentiment when it comes to these sorts of things? Well, it''s a platform. People will build whatever they want to build. It''s permissionless. That''s very important. But it''s also about the community built. Do we encourage some type of activity or do you discourage some kind of activities? Coming back to the investment question. If you apply more investing in certain types of activity because it gives you value, increase your economic activity as a result, increase your growth, you''re more incentivized to keep on plowing money back into that industry. And that''s what we saw happen with certain other platforms. And that really hasn''t happened on suite, right? So, you know, we do have a role to play here in shaping the economy and shaping what happens on our platform. And how do you do that? Like, it''s decentralized. Like, how do you create that better community? It''s investment. Investment is ultimately the encouragement. So, investment in what sense? Maybe I''m not understanding. Well, in helping them to market certain kind of product to help certain kind of product attracts more attention to literally put money back into this, right? You probably have seen certain blockchain that have funds specifically allocated to means. Yeah. And again, means are not necessarily bad because it''s a wide range of different kind of coin. Some are very much community based and where people come together and celebrate their identity of being part of the community. That''s fine. But we''re seeing recently, unfortunately, there''s some, I would say, more celebrity tokens that sort of are designed explicitly to attract attention because that notoriety of the person identity behind it. And then, unfortunately, some of them end up extracting value. Yeah. Right. And that value flow out of the ecosystem rather than going back into the economy. Right. And then that''s bad. So, there''s this thing, there''s very, very different, right? Right. So, it is hard, right? Yeah. Let''s not get a, you know, let''s not beat around the bush. Growing any economy, growing any ecosystem is extremely difficult. And what we''re seeing is everybody''s trying to learn and what works and what doesn''t work, what is good and what not. So, there is going to continue to have, unfortunately, the downside of this permissionless, you know, publishing platform. But hopefully, over time, we''ll see a lot more good that come out in the back. Yeah. Well, Evan, thank you so much. Thank you all for joining us. I think we covered a lot of ground. Yeah.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('defi_s_infrastructure', 'DeFi_s Infrastructure', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Excellent, good afternoon. How is Hong Kong doing? My name is Charles. I''m the CEO of the DYDX Foundation. I''m super excited to have an old colleague of mine. I am from Consensys Linea and a friend of mine, a peer from the perp industry, Ran. And we''re going to chat about DeFi infrastructure in our everyday life. Our teams are working, improving, fixing infrastructure for DeFi. And the way I suggest we kind of build this conversation is thinking about three layers of infrastructure around DeFi applications, if that''s okay. We can talk first about the base layer. How do we connect via RPCs? How do we deal with multi-chain or your own chain in the case of DYDX? Maybe later we can speak about how the wallets and the user experience at the application level are evolving and how we look at infrastructure around that. And maybe if we have time we can talk about the assets. The assets are not really an infrastructure per se, but they are part of the kind of bricks we bring together for having our DeFi applications working. So yeah, let''s get started if that''s okay. Yeah. Do you want to tell us more about what keeps you busy at Linear maybe? And we''ll do the same with you if that''s okay. I feel like I''m the sort of layered sandwich between the two perps. We are nice people. We are nice people. We will not put too much leverage on you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Keep leverage and control, right? So yeah, look, I look after partnerships at Linear, previously working on the MetaMask product. And yeah, we''ve been rolling out our ecosystem for the last year and a half and gradually building up a DeFi ecosystem and infrastructure to support a number of things that we''ve been working on. We did a number of experiments on the... Linear is like a Layer 2 EVM, a ZKEVM on top of Ethereum. It''s completely Ethereum equivalent. So if whatever you deploy onto Ethereum, it will work on Linear. We recently upgraded the network to 27.5 MGAS per second. So we''re one of the leading Layer 2s in terms of sort of scale. And yeah, we sort of did a lot of experimentation last year around like point system to try to get people to use DeFi and, you know, deposit, trade, you know, use pools, use set up markets, all of that stuff. And that sort of almost like helped us sort of prove a level of volume or a level of TPS, which then gave confidence to the MetaMask team to actually deploy their debit card onto our network. So, you know, probably not so much in this region, but we''ve got like 32 countries now launched with the MetaMask debit card. And we''re starting to see an ecosystem develop around the card to allow users to like borrow land and so on. So it''s quite an exciting sort of organic growth of the intersection between like the sort of base layer of the network and then the sort of blocks that start to sort of, the Lego blocks that start to build on top. Excellent. Yep. Thank you for that. Ran. Thanks, Charles. Ran, co-founder of Orderly. Orderly aims to allow anyone to trade anything from anywhere. And what that means is in the chain abstracted experience, we have an omni chain perpetuals order book that sits on top of currently 10 chains, including EVMs and Solana. And I think we''re the first one to allow this kind of a structure between EVM and Solana, where users can deposit from one chain and withdraw from another chain while trading perpetuals. And the whole point is to have like a centralized exchange experience or the info that allows that. And on top of us are 35 different builders who have their own perpetuals experiences for their target audience, which includes Telegram bots, AMMs. So Radium, the largest AMM on Solana, their perpetuals launched on top of Orderly about two months ago. So that''s an example of one of the builders that we''re working with. We have over 100 markets listed now, about 90 billion in cumulative volumes since end of 2023. And happy to be here. Thanks. How do you deal with the RPCs and access to your infrastructures and to your DeFi protocols? I know, for example, we can start with consensus. You have a big practice. Infura is one of the OG infrastructure providers. How did Infura support the birth of DeFi on linear? Yeah. Was it, what was the learnings? And when you build infrastructure for DeFi in 2025 or call it 2024, what are you doing differently compared to the old first generations of DeFi, which was on the mainnet, for example? Yeah, I think the sort of getting access to the networks and the chains itself, you know, we both worked on Infura back in the past. You''ve got other RPC providers like Alchemy, Quicknode. And, you know, early on in our journey with Infura, we were sort of accused of being quite a centralizing force within Ethereum. I think, like, at one point, you know, probably 80% of all Ethereum transactions were going through Infura. And that was, like, centered around a specific AWS region and so on. So what we''ve, at consensus, what we''ve done is we''ve tried to look at being able to decentralize that infrastructure now. And so what we''ve done is taken the Infura service and created a sort of next generation of that service, which is basically allows us to route RPC traffic to different operators. What that means is that other companies can participate in providing RPC services. It''s an eigenlayer AVS service. So what it allows us to do is distribute load to different players in the network. Including your competitors. Including our competitors. Very nice. It allows, you know, and if one player is not providing availability, they''ll, you know, eventually will have the slashing mechanisms to make sure. And that then basically provides sort of the DeFi layer the ability to get one predictable high availability access to these networks. Secondly, to get a much broader set of chains to be supported. So you basically, you know, within Infura, it used to take us months to get a new chain working. Now it takes us, like, a day or two to get a new chain working with our decentralized infrastructure service. It''s called DIN. When token? When token? Well, let''s get through our first token. Let''s get ourselves through the first token, yeah. And then we''ll move on to that one. The, so, yeah, I think I''m quite excited about, and then from a linear perspective, you know, yes, we were working with Infura and DIN. But we''ve also, like, partnered very closely with Quicknode and Alchemy as well to make sure that the DeFi players have choice, right? Absolutely. And if you, let''s say, you pick Alchemy as your preferred RPC infrastructure provider, that you''ve also got an option of a different provider for backup, let''s say. Excellent. So, yeah, it''s quite exciting. And I think, like, you know, RPC has been a centralizing force. I think that''s changing now, and we''re really seeing this sort of decentralization of the access to the network. Excellent. Aran, you described your service orderly as some kind of sub-layer below the apps for perps trading. How did you build the infrastructure to essentially accommodate all these different frontends that are your customers? I suppose some of them are running on Solana, you were mentioning, Radium, but maybe some others are on some other L1s or some L2s. Can you give us a little bit of an overview of how you built your infrastructure and access points knowing that people are coming from multiple doors and sometimes windows? Yes. So we''re live on 10 different chains now, and what''s there are... Are you running your nose yourself, or are you using a subcontractor or something? We are using operators. So we have our own chain called the orderly chain that''s built using OP stack, but we''re using conduit as the operator for it. But the chain is not something where we invite others to build on it yet. It''s more just as a settlement layer because our sequencing is still centralized, and then post-trades it settles on our chain, what I described, the orderly chain built using OP stack. And it''s using Celestia for data availability. And how it connects to each other chain, which hold our custody vaults, that''s where users deposit and withdraw assets. Simple custody smart contracts on the chains that were deployed on, including Solana. And they''re all linked together by Layer 0''s cross-chain messaging. So when a user deposits in our vault, that message gets sent via Layer 0 to our chain that records that information. The user''s trading and it settles on our chain. And when they want to withdraw, let''s say, from Arbitrum, another message goes from Layer 0 to our vault in Arbitrum, which they withdraw. So it''s set up in such a way, and essentially we try to replace a centralized exchange set up by using our chain that just does the settlements. And then cross-chain messaging is via Layer 0. And by having native integrations with the chains, we are able to kind of keep the TVL on the source chains. Like if we were to work with Linea, the users would deposit and withdraw from your chain. It''s not trying to attract assets to our chain. And as we go multi-collateral, we can accommodate a lot more native assets to be used as collateral for perps. So it just sits on top of it. And then to the builder side, it''s SDKs, essentially. We just have a very simple SDK for builders to be able to build their experiences on top. And it could be easy. It could be done in a few days. We want to shrink that to a few hours. And now even offer no-code solutions for people to build a DEX, kind of like DEX as a service. But even for people, let''s say KOLs, who don''t know how to code. Right? But then they do want like a DEX. So then we have a solution for them as well. Do you have a sense of the traffic on orderly desktop traffic versus mobile traffic? I don''t have the numbers off the top of my head. But we do have, I mean, what we have is a PW. We don''t have an app, right? So it depends on the experiences of the builders on top. Like one of the larger ones, MuFi, they have just a PWA. There''s no app built. So that''s kind of, but it''s limiting experience. Right? So and then traffic, it''s somewhere through Telegram. Like Vui, another builder, they have Telegram bots. And there''s even one with a Twitter plugin where people can trade via Twitter plugin, FlashX. So it''s different experiences for whichever users. And they''re targeting different GOs as well. So that''s what we''re trying to do. We''re trying to have this infrastructure, Omni-Chain info, for them to build their apps on top. And they can do the user acquisition. We can help them do it. We can hold campaigns and incentivize with our tokens and such. That''s a super cool segue to move to the second part of the conversation, if that''s okay. We started with DeFi infrastructure at the RPC level, low level and low layer. Yeah. Before we move on, like what do you guys do at DYDX from that sort of infrastructure layer? Absolutely. So DYDX, we used to be on Ethereum. So DYDX does perps since 2018. So it has been a kind of OG in the perp space. We used to be on Ethereum layer one. And then we were very early adopters of layer two. We start where one of the biggest users at the time of layer twos. And eventually, the engineers decided to say, okay, let''s keep leveraging the best technology available to keep progressing into decentralization. And that''s when the engineers decided to essentially build the DYDX chain, which was launched effectively last year, so now the Ethereum version of DYDX is closed, definitely. And everything is happening on the DYDX chain. In terms of access, people can access DYDX via mobile phone, via desktop, obviously. People can, in a permissionless manner, also build their own front-ends. Some people have built front-ends on Airbit. Some people are building their own front-ends for all kinds of reasons. And in terms of pure access to the chain itself, either people connect directly to an indexer. The indexer for the DYDX chain is run by the operation DAO. DYDX is very, very decentralized. So there is a DAO, which runs multiple services for the chain itself. And connecting to DYDX via the indexer is one option. But some very sophisticated players around high-frequency trading will be also running their own full node. A full node is essentially part of the network, but only for reading and not validating any transactions. And being able to broadcast to the network in a much more efficient way your orders or whatever you want to do with the chain. So it''s a very interesting play where you find some kind, I would say, traditional users of the chain, which will want to get access via an indexer or just traditional APIs. And some others will be way more sophisticated by the nature of the application and the application chain. That is DYDX, where people trade perps at very high frequency. To give you an order of magnitude, last year, DYDX recorded 270 billion US dollars of trading volume on the DYDX chain. So that''s roughly 800 million dollars a day. So it comes with a lot of activity. And it''s very important for the infrastructure of such platform to be accommodating people which are coming with an average consumption of it. And some people which will be extremely sophisticated. So high performance API plus, at the design itself, being able to basically customize your access to the chain. So whenever you want to hit the chain, you can hit five, ten nodes at the same time and make sure that you can hit the chain and execute your orders or your views on the market with the highest level of efficiency. Let''s move on to the upper layer guys, if you don''t mind. Wallets and everything on the top of RPCs on the top of the application. How have you seen the market evolving on your front and what are you putting in place in your respective project for the infrastructure of your DeFi users? Let''s step away from RPCs and go more into the users and the user interfaces. Well for us, one example is we always wanted to abstract chains from the very beginning. So our DeX built on top of orderly, they''re automatically omni-chain. Like if you use something like WuFi, you can just deposit from one chain and withdraw from another, just like a centralized exchange. We aim to make that experience and where the chains are just abstracted away and you''re using native assets, right? Even in Bitcoin, Dogecoin later, I think it''s possible to do that to some extent where you''re depositing native assets and withdrawing native assets while it being used for collateral, for perps or for spot trading. I think that''s the experience that people want. I mean some people can even use us as a bridge. I mean we''re using layer zero messaging so people can use us as a bridge and I think some do. So that''s on the chain level. And then on the onboarding level, I mean we''re seeing, I mean we''re not doing this ourselves, but we''re seeing a ton of innovations there in terms of Web2 logins and Privy and Fiat on ramps, right? Like, so it''s pretty soon I think you''re just, we don''t have to use seed phrases, we don''t have to memorize them. It''ll also be secure. Now even like WuFi, it''s QR code scan, no need to interact with Wallace really and using, you know, passkey on your phone to do the login. So I think we''re very, very close to that where it very, very much mimics the centralized exchange experience. And then with assets already moving on chain with the meme coins and such, I think it''s kind of a dire situation for some centralized exchanges who haven''t went all in on their Web3 applications. How do we bring a hundred more millions of DeFi users in? So I think our approach on the Metamask side, you know, first of all our focus has been to make it more seamless to go cross chain. You know, having the, we almost like want to get away from the user being aware of which chain they''re working with. You know, if they want to like, you know, use an asset for collateral, it doesn''t, shouldn''t really matter where it sits. And it shouldn''t matter where it''s, you know, where, where that collateral then gets used in terms of, let''s say, if it''s a loan or whatever. And so the first step for us was like to move, you know, Metamask is quite an old product. It''s been around, you know, almost like nine years now. And, you know, it was conceived in a single chain environment with Ethereum. And we''re very much now moved, we sort of moved the entire architecture of the wallet to be a multi-chain environment. And, you know, we''ll, you''ll see a number of significant UI improvements over the next couple of months around abstracting away the, the, the, the sort of chain detection. So we, we already have the ability to automatically switch chains. And, and the more of that abstraction is going to happen. I think, you know, beyond that, there''s a couple of things. First of all, moving away from just EOAs to sort of smart contract based wallets and using, we''ve got a framework called Delegatable, which allows us to sort of almost delegate sort of spending or transaction or approval type processes from one wallet to another. So you can say, you don''t need to migrate off the EOA, but you could just say, I''m going to delegate, you know, the ability to do certain trades to a smart contract wallet and, and, and, and sort of get away from having to do everything signed by the EOA. And then lastly, what we''re, we''re, we''re really sort of trying to bring more like real world use cases to our users. So, you know, I, I, I talked about the rollout of the debit card. You know, we''re, we''re at 32 countries at the moment. That allows you to spend stable coins directly out of your wallet. We should get to about 80 countries by the end of the year. And what we''re starting to see here is retail users can spend, but what, what are they going to use to spend? So we''re starting to see those users look for DeFi blocks to be able to, let''s say, take their ETH or rat Bitcoin as collateral, take out a loan, maybe in a local stable coin to be able to spend on like their day-to-day, day-to-day things. And, and I''m sort of starting to see that happen, one, on the linear side with, let''s say, for example, Aave. They, they, they, they deployed onto linear last week. But I''m also starting to see more of the cross-chain use cases where the user doesn''t want to have to take their assets from, let''s say, Arbitrum and put them onto linear to, to use DeFi. They just use the assets that sit on Arbitrum and take out a loan on linear to spend. And so you get this sort of cross-chain use of DeFi, but not just for trading, but actually for real world sort of, you know, I''m tapping to get on the MTR. I''m tapping to spend in the bakery or the pharmacy and I''m using DeFi to do that. And then I think the evolution is going to be like going from, let''s say, cross-chain lending and borrowing to an environment where when I tap with my, like, Google Pay or Apple Pay, I''m actually triggering a DeFi microloan and it will be much more efficient than taking out a credit card loan. And keep your money at work whenever, whenever you''re, you''re earning yield right to that last possible point in time where you tap. So you''re sort of controlling your assets rather than handing them to like a top-up fund. DeFi needs these kind of unique value propositions to basically accelerate the migration away. I would like to make one point, something I''m working very hard with my team now. I believe that the DeFi distribution is totally broken. I''ve seen too many projects, DYDX being one of them, trying to acquire users directly. And I think as a practitioner of this industry, we can think more deeply about how Web3 products and DeFi products would be distributed. And I believe the DeFi infrastructure might actually be CeFi. And let me build on this. What you see is the CeFi players, the Binance, the Coinbase of the world, probably have 200 million, 250 million users if you aggregate all the customers from all these centralized exchanges. All these centralized exchanges are in a global race to acquire licenses in as many countries as possible. Every time they get a license, it''s mostly for spots. So they have to stop lending, they have to stop futures, they have to stop many activities because the license they get is only for spots, for the most part. So what you see is all these centralized exchanges are building their own wallets. The Coinbase wallets, the Binance wallets, the OKEx wallets, and so on. And what I believe is we DeFi practitioners should consider very strongly to essentially bring the product where the users are. And in my opinion, the next 100 million DeFi users are in CeFi. The CeFi users are just almost ready users for DeFi. They''re already crypto-educated. They understand the various coins. They understand the concept of different chains when they want to withdraw or deposit from different chains. And what we see is the CeFi players starting to expand their footprint into DeFi. And these centralized players, the sexies of the world, they want to keep basically the customers within their ecosystem. And they are telling their customers, oh, if you want to go into perps, should it be with DYDX or someone else? If you want to go into lending with Aave or someone else? We''re going to facilitate all the plumbing. We''re going to facilitate all the bridging by essentially facilitating and being a gateway to DeFi. So in my opinion, one of the infrastructure challenges of DeFi might be CeFi, even though it''s kind of counterintuitive. Because this is where a lot of users are. This is where there is a lot of engineering which is ready to facilitate the access. And bringing the product where the users are works very well. If you look at your traditional finance experience, if you''re a customer of HSBC or Citibank, they bring to you insurance. They bring to you brokerage. They bring to you FX. And it''s very convenient. You don''t want to open five or six accounts. So we are reinventing finance, but we''re not reinventing people. People remain the same. I remain the same. A little bit lazy, I have to say. And I just want the comfort of things. So I believe all of these kind of silos between CeFi and DeFi will become more and more blurred and start to overlap. And maybe I''ll close with that. Possibly the best infrastructure upgrade for DeFi might be CeFi. What do you think? I think that there''s different opinions in the CeFi world about the future of centralized exchanges and whether they have a limited lifespan and that the future has to be decentralized exchanges. And we''re definitely seeing that like OKX, for example, have both their centralized exchange and their DEX service. You know, I''ve been speaking to centralized exchanges in the sort of European and sort of Middle East space, which also have like this opinion that their centralized exchanges have limited lifespans and that they need to sort of move a lot of that on chain. And so if you look at the history of money, people keep using cash, people keep using check. There is it takes time to move all of this. So I think all of this kind of infrastructure will survive over time. I agree. It takes time. And, you know, typically we sort of get frustrated with how slow it does, but then we underestimate how big it will be eventually. That''s true. But I think that, you know, users are going to demand better yield. They''re going to demand cheaper access to credit. There''s too many people that don''t have access to these services outside of like the West, I''d say. And I think it''s just naturally that there''s a demand that money will find a way, right? I don''t know what your view is. Yeah, I totally agree with you, Charles. I think it actually makes more sense to think of it as front end and back end, back end plus liquidity instead of C-Fi and D-Fi because the lines will be very blurred, like you said. Currently, like centralized exchanges are front end and back end together, right, which is imperfect as now the back end liquidity is going on chain. I think in the longer run, all the back end plus liquidity will be on chain now starting with the meme spot. And then later it will just be front ends routing to all of these things on chain, perps for GYDX, us, spot, Uniswap, Radium, lending. And then, you know, it''ll be like Jupiter. It''ll be like AI agents start on the front end. And everything powering it will be on chain. And I think that''s kind of where the world is going. And the centralized exchanges will be, like you said, gateways for fiat, for KYC. And it''s already happening with their own earned products, with the Web3 wallets, with even liquidity. You know, I think Robinhood is working with Uniswap. It''s already happening. So it''ll be a front end and back end plus liquidity infrastructure that we''re looking to in the future. And I think beyond the centralized exchange, I do think, like, even into TradFi, you know, the banking system is so archaic. And, you know, I''m like, you know, doing a cross-border transfer of funds is still T plus two. And, you know, on chain is, like, going to solve so many problems for them. It is already today, 100%. And it will, you know, I just see, you know, just traditional banking start to leverage these tools as regulation comes and opens up and allows them to offer those services as well. So I think it, you know, the users, the organizations that own the users will just expand their offerings. And then we''ll have disruptors come in and take some of those as well. And it''ll just be very natural. Excellent. Aya and Ran, we are running out of time. Consensus Hong Kong, thank you so much for joining us in this conversation. And we look forward to the next ones.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('depin_revolution__connecting_the_physical__digital_worlds', 'DePIN Revolution_ Connecting the Physical & Digital Worlds', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Alistair Foster Good afternoon everyone I''m Alistair Foster, CEO of Bullish Capital. We''ve heard a lot this week about meme coins. Enough of that, we''re going to talk about actually building some real stuff. We''re going to talk about D-Pen, decentralized physical infrastructure networks. And I have the perfect panel here today to do that. We''re going to talk about planes, phones, and automobiles. I have Robin Wingard, CEO and co-founder of WingBits here. Rob Solomon from DEMO and CEO of Digital Infrastructure Inc. And Frank Mong, who is COO of Nova, which is the creator of the Helium Network. So let''s start with a question on, well, should I give you a chance to introduce yourselves first? Maybe you can introduce yourselves and tell us a little bit about WingBits and Helium and DEMO, and then we''re going to get into regulation. Yeah. Robin. Thanks Alistair. Thanks everybody for being here. Really an honor to be here today. My name is Robin, CEO, co-founder of WingBits. And at WingBits what we''re doing is building a flight tracking network. What most people don''t understand is that pretty much all flight data in the world is already gathered by volunteers. So it''s decentralized in nature. We just try to align the incentives between company and community by rewarding for that data. And yeah, so that''s what we do. We aggregate that data and then we sell it to multiple different customers within aviation industry. Rob. I''m Rob, co-founder of DEMO. DEMO is a D-PIN for connecting cars. We actually, we used to, when we were raising money, we said we were Helium for cars and that was enough for people to open up their checkbook and fund the company because Helium was so cool. And you can think of us like if you''re familiar with Plaid, where you can connect your bank account to any app that you want, we allow you to add your car to the blockchain and connect it to any app you want. So if you want to share your data with your insurance company and get a discount, if you want to share your charging data to earn carbon offsets, whatever it is, you can take control of your car''s data and share it with smart and interesting apps. Frank. Yeah, thank you. I''m Frank Mong. I''m the COO of Nova Labs. I''m part of the founding team of the Helium Network from 2017. We''ve really been around for quite a bit considering crypto cycles. And the Helium IoT network that we launched in 2019 has roughly 350,000 hotspots around the world across 180 countries, 80,000 cities. And our latest effort is really around cellular, taking our token economics model into the cellular world. And we''ve got about 450,000 users on our network per day. And the network is transferring roughly 40 to 50 terabytes of data a day in the United States and Mexico. And so we continue our efforts and hopefully someday we''ll be here in Hong Kong as well. Okay, I''m going to start with a question on regulation and the U.S. in particular. Because if we go back just one month on the very last day in office of Gary Gensler when he was in charge of the SEC, an enforcement action was filed against helium creator Nova Labs. That they chose as a final target one of the prominent protocols in this space, building something real and useful. I think sums up the industry''s frustration with the former SEC administration. Perhaps put into stark contrast when that very, very same evening the president-elect launched his own meme coin. I''m also going to start with Frank on this one. We now have a very different administration in D.C. We have a crypto czar pushing for regulatory clarity. How do you think this is going to impact Deepin space? Could we be on the verge of a golden era for Deepin? Yeah, I think I''m very optimistic on decentralized physical infrastructure and crypto at large with the current U.S. administration and the current U.S. SEC approach to crypto. So I''m very hopeful. I''m very optimistic on where we''re going to go next. But our engagement with the U.S. SEC actually has gone back five, six years. In the first Trump administration, we actually spoke quite a bit with the SEC about how to think about mining, how to think about wireless network creation and decentralizing that where mining is involved, mining rewards are involved in the form of crypto. And so we had extensive conversations with them during that time. And we were looking for guidance. And even back then, this is five years ago, that administration really didn''t know what to do. And the outcome of our conversation was, hey, we don''t think helium and what you''re doing is within our jurisdiction. That was the net result. And then when Gary Gensler came in with the Biden administration, they became very aggressive. And, you know, they went after all crypto. Didn''t matter if it was helium or somebody else. But every crypto had a every crypto company had a target on its back in the USA. But it''s where we launched and it''s where we stayed regardless. And I think given what''s happened with the current president, current administration, I think everything will be, you know, on a positive side for us. We hope so. Rob, do you have thoughts on this you want to share? I think part of it is the regulatory and obviously larger. It was almost like there was a dumbbell. They would go after some of the worst, but then they would also pick off the best, most successful projects. Uniswap, ConsenSys, Helium, Coinbase. I think OpenSea, too. I don''t know. It''s just they would pick off these great projects and it really just kind of chilled everybody in the space. Even if you were a smaller project, you spent so much money and time trying to organize everything such that you wouldn''t run into that issue for yourself. And it probably scared investors and participants off projects. So it''s great to have that lifted. The other side of it is our culture and how we as an industry move forward. I think that it''s coming at a good time. The regulatory side will improve at the same time. And meme coins, I think, should and will continue to be legal. But I think we''re kind of running through a natural cycle here where the end bag holders are tired of getting their faces ripped off. So now it''s the trench warriors who are the ones left holding the bag and they''re upset. So you''re seeing that on crypto Twitter more. And now it''s coming back to the KOLs. Eventually there''s no one wanting to hold the bag. And so they''re going to start to look to things that have more fundamental value. That have the original I joined the space in 2017 and a lot of people are getting into crypto because they wanted to see better supply chains and identity systems and voting and inspiring cool use cases. And we''ve gotten away from that. I think people are ready to get back to it. Robin, you and Wingbase are based in Europe. So you have the Mika regime to contend with. Yeah. How do you see that affecting Deepin''s? I think at least with Mika coming out, even though it''s quite strict, at least it''s it seems like it''s fairly straightforward to adhere to it, which I think with the US regulation in the past, it''s just been super unpredictable. And no one really knew how to navigate it. Right. So I think with the new administration, hopefully better regulation coming in, it will actually open up for more people to be willing to go into the space because they have something maybe better to adhere to. For us with Mika, you know, we work on a global, so we are going to be Mika compliant. But obviously, US is a big market for us. We''re also watching that. So I''m I''m I''m very positive, you know, looking forward where it''s going. Hopefully it''s easier to navigate for sure. And my background is not so much in Web3. Just got into space when we started WingBits. So it''s definitely been a very steep learning curve for me, kind of getting the hang of all these things. I want to ask a question about Deepin demand. For most projects, scaling supply side capacity does not seem to be a challenge. But finding the demand side has been more elusive. I have a tweet I saw recently touched on on this theme that I wanted to anchor this question with. It was from Meltem Demers, an investor and indeed alumnus of ConsenSys in one of our former lives. I think she captured this well. She said, OK, I think I''ve finally sort of got into the root of my issue with Deepin as a category. Data gathering slash observability is step one, but it is in and of itself not a valuable exercise. Interesting your thoughts on this. Maybe start with Rob. Yeah, there''s there''s two things I disagree with in that. One, I think I think crypto overall has struggled with demand side and the things that have succeeded have been crypto serving other crypto. It''s been a bit more circular. I think Deepin is one of the examples where you''re actually seeing the most. You said 450 or 400 some thousand actual phones, real phone plans. We are pretty early on and the life cycle of a company and we are starting to have a lot of success. As much as crypto people like demo, automotive companies like it even more because they understand right away the actual utility and value. You''re seeing a lot of Deepin projects have a lot of success in that. So that''s one. And two, you''re seeing back in the day, I remember like Facebook and Twitter adding a lot of users and it''s like, well, what are they going to do to monetize that? And now it''s obvious. Oh, they have an advertising based model. But I remember people having issues with those businesses early on saying, oh, it''s there''s no there''s no money there. Obviously, they were able to figure that out. If you''re able to build a giant network of supply and the use cases make sense to you, odds are higher that they''re going to find that demand. And I think you''re seeing that play out with a lot of Deepin projects. Robin, I mean, I think on the demand side, from my point of view, coming from a traditional business background, entrepreneurial background, the way we approached WingBits was essentially we saw that there was a problem in the industry and there was an opportunity. And we approached it from a way like how do we best solve this problem? And this was just the best way to solve it. So we really validated the demand side in the business case and Web3 was the absolute best way to go into it. And now going into the space for this last year, I love it. I think there''s so much power in this model. I think we''re finally, from my point of view, going to see some real sustainable, long term sustainable businesses. And I think that''s what''s needed to get wider adoption, because for us dealing with aviation, they are pretty skeptical to Web3. And I think we need to showcase to the world that you can create a solid business with a strong demand side that is sustainable long term to essentially kind of validate the whole industry. I like it. I mean, Helium, I think, is an amazing thing going into the phone plans. I mean, obviously, you know, super good. Helium is the OG, the poster child. Yeah. Interesting Frank''s thoughts on that. Yeah, I don''t actually understand Meltem''s comment. I''d love for her to, you know, explain that to me at some point. But my point of view as it relates to demand is very similar to the folks up here on stage with me. And from this last seven years in both creating supply with a network and looking at demand and focusing on how do we actually get demand to jump onto this supply, what I learned is its value and the value in this case isn''t like yield or something and some financial product or or or defy product. But the value the value for us in the world of physical goods is actually whatever I''m doing today. And if you inject crypto into it, it''s got to be better somehow. You just have to do it better, whether it''s cars or satellites, whatever it might be. It has to be better. So for us, I think where we hit our sweet spot or product market fit is connecting people''s cell phones to a decentralized network called helium. But why would you do that? It''s got to be better. And so after a year and a half of trying to figure that out in the United States market, what we realize is what better is for you as a consumer has to happen now. And in the world of phone plans, it''s got to be free. If you get a free phone plan that''s useful, you can use it every month and it''s free. Like, why wouldn''t you do that? And our approach to this process is really not to expose crypto to any of you. You don''t have to understand crypto. You just have to understand that you want to get on the Internet. You need to have a phone and a phone number that you can use in case of an emergency or talk to your family and friends. And it''s got to work everywhere. And so that''s what healing mobile has done is really taken that approach of let''s just give the benefit and value that''s greater than everything else out there today. That''s Web three powered. That''s crypto powered. It''s a free phone plan. You try it. You use it. Phenomenal. It''s great. Like there''s nothing better than free and it works and it works well. And that I think ultimately that to us is how we get to that massive growth and massive scale. And to me, that''s super important, not just for helium and what we''re trying to do, but certainly for the pin. But I think in an effort to change the narrative of crypto, it''s not mean coins. It''s not about Trump or Libra. It''s not about the garbage. It''s really about, hey, how do we make the world better and get consumers on board? And when I say consumers, I mean everybody. You guys are here because you understand crypto, but imagine if you can bring your mom and dad and your friends, your neighbors. Like I have no clue what technology is and no clue what crypto is, but they had a great phone plan that was free. All because crypto is the underlining power that''s underneath that economy. That to me is the most important value. I want to dive deeper into that a little bit, but approach it from this angle. I wanted to ask about convergence and really two part question on convergence, because we''re beginning to see some deep ends converge with other deep end. Even amongst the protocols here, we know that DEMO works with Helium. Helium''s announced a partnership with Dawn. WingBits has announced a dual miner with GeoNet. So interested where all this convergence ends. Do we need multiple deep end boxes or do we end up with one box which will provide all deep end functionality? And then part two of my question is we''re also seeing increasing deep end convergence with traditional industries and businesses. Helium now working with major telecom carriers. And I know there''s been a sort of leak or announcement on that, which you may or may not be able to say more upon that. But that''s very exciting. DEMO has integrations with finance and insurance companies. Robin, WingBits has just announced you''re firing a satellite into space, which is, I''m sure, deep in the first. So interested in where this trend is going. Maybe I''ll start with you, Robin. You can tell us about the satellite. Yeah, I mean, so to your first point where it''s about the GeoNet stuff. I think when we look at it, since we sell data, we have a lot of other projects that have complementary or data with very good synergy. So like, you know, I think where the space needs to go a little bit is creating partnerships, distribution type partnerships, because I can sell our data combined with other many other points, types of data to the same customers that have benefits everybody. On the mining side, from a consumer point of view or a miner point of view, it would make way more sense to have less pieces of hardware to mine the data. And I think it would also, you know, diversify what they''re doing, making it safer in a sense to participate. I think it needs to go that way. On the satellite part, you know, we announced yesterday we''ve had a commercial partnership with a company called Spire Global now for about six months. They''re an aerospace company and yesterday we announced we''re shooting up a satellite together with them on SpaceX, SpaceX T13 transporter now in a few weeks. And really what that just goes to show is that this is just a small step in something bigger. But the satellite essentially will serve to validate our ground network. And what we want to do is essentially, yeah, I guess we want to go from deep into deep space eventually. But it''s an exciting partnership. And I think it validates our business case showing that publicly traded company trust our data enough, even though we''re, you know, a crypto project. And I think we need more of that. And hopefully it brings more people in and lowers the skepticism a little bit. Rob? I don''t think there''s anything magic about collaborating with other deepens. I think to Frank''s point about these products need to be better. And the reason we use Helium for our device is because it''s very cheap and easy to deploy. Like, let''s say you''re a car dealership and you want to build your own LoRaWAN network. It''s incredibly cheap to buy these devices, put them up. The data cost is objectively less. We didn''t do it as like a favor to a fellow deep in or just because we thought it was on brand. It was a good business decision for us. So for the same reason you see, like Netflix puts their app on Apple TV, not in like antenna TV or cable. They go to the new thing because why go try to build on the old outdated rails? Just go to where the puck is going. Look at the future. Same reason as you do that. Same reason is that you partner with the deep in projects. And I think crypto generally, like we enjoy being co-located near other deepens and partnering. But like people are out there building car titles on chain, NFT marketplaces that we could use in the future to buy and sell cars. You know, insurance products, on chain car rental companies. And those are the ones that, you know, it''s awesome for us to be able to collaborate with as well. So yeah, deep in another crypto, just things can happen easier. Everyone already has wallets. Everybody already has tokens. And so integrating one of these things is incredibly fast. Frank. Yeah, I think there''s two parts to this. One is, you know, as Rob noted, like we just need to bring better products to market. And sometimes that means, you know, you can leverage one deep in technology or another to make that overall a better product. So if that''s the case, great. It''s a win for everybody, especially the consumer, the person on the other side that has the demand for this. And so I think a lot of times what we do isn''t well understood because it''s not a direct benefit to the end consumer. You know, like wing bits and the launch in a satellite that that that has so such big ramifications for all of us for air flight safety that we just take for granted in a way that utility is is happening. They do it better than how they do it today. But you we don''t know that like unless we see planes fall out of the sky, which is happening actually in the United States. But that aside, you know, wing bits can solve some of those problems, which we take for granted. We think flight flying around is safe for the most part. We hope so. And when demo is tracking cars and getting the data from cars, like we take that for granted. Why is that even important to us? But it puts the car manufacturer really on call. Like they got to make a better product overall if the data is being tracked and everyone can see it. Right. It''s public and it''s understandable. So I think there''s a lot of value to doing that. But we take that for granted. Right. And I think when you get to what helium is doing, and I mentioned a better product earlier, already with a free phone plan, I think, I think for us, it''s also about go to market, whether we''ve created a massive community. That''s part of the healing community. And if that can be leveraged by our partners and friends that are trying to solve really important problems, they should, they should leverage that. Like we''ve never gatekeep our community. We never asked anybody to do us any favors, but we were very open about that. Like we want folks that are trying to solve hard problems to leverage the healing community because they''re excited. Our community is excited. They love solving big problems. They want to take ownership of that and they want to be part of the system and part of building versus just someone that has to pay a bill constantly. Right. And so to me, that''s a lot of the value of what we bring to crypto. I think that isn''t well understood and maybe we just haven''t talked about it a lot because we''re in the trenches. We''re always building. We''re just we''re in the back. We''re the crazy plumbers and scientists. Right. But I think I think at the end of the day, that''s why we spent a lot of time at helium talking to large telcos. We have to bridge the masses like the old way web to the telecommunications companies. They''ve been doing their thing for like a couple hundred years without much change. And I think helium is probably the biggest single threat to all of them. And instead of attacking them, I think it''s best that we figure out how to infiltrate and work with them and help them along. Bring them into crypto, bring them into Web3, help them see the benefits that we can bring. And today, a lot of those companies see that. A lot of our investors see it. Deutsche Telekom, T-Mobile, Telefonica, Vodafone. They all invested in us. Our partner in the United States, T-Mobile, sees it. And just very recently, our pilot with Telefonica has gone very well. And they see it as well in Mexico. And so I''m hoping that that just helps us continue to gain momentum and trust with legacy Web2 systems. And we can be here in Hong Kong and work with Hong Kong Telecom or go to Japan and work with the Japanese folks and the folks in South Korea. Like, there''s a lot of opportunity to grow and expand. But I think we have to prove ourselves. Like, all three of us up here have to deliver a better product. Consumers have to tell us it''s a better product. And the more we can build in that mass way of mass adoption, I think mainstream legacy systems, legacy companies, they''re going to come and join us. Okay, we''ve had a lot of consensus in the answer so far. Let''s see if I can change that. Let''s talk about infrastructure for a moment. We have a marked difference today to four years ago when it could cost hundreds of dollars to execute a single transaction on Ethereum. We now have fast, cheap, plentiful block space. So I want to ask how important it is, what infrastructure you choose. Your projects have interacted with a variety of blockchains. Helium started off with its own blockchain and migrated to Solana. Demo currently runs on Polygon but has announced a migration in the future to Base. WingBits has its testnet on Solana. So my question is, does it matter what blockchain you choose? One of those, or we also have deep in specific blockchains now, IoTeX, Peak. Interesting your thoughts on does it matter and why? Maybe we''ll start off with Rob on that one. I think it certainly matters from a marketing perspective. Undoubtedly, over the last cycle, being on Solana was the popular choice. I mean, also, you know, performs very well. It''s very fast and cheap. People like that. Now people are, I think some of the initial hype was overblown, but also the initial hate for Solana is like also just crazy to me. I like Solana. But the reason that we''re on, there''s a couple different things. Every deep in project tends to have a token. And that can be anywhere. You can have the, our token''s multi-chain. We''ll keep adding more. But then there''s like, if you''re building it as a protocol, where does that go? And we meant the car on chain. If you''re going to give permission to somebody else, to a developer, to another user to access that car, that''s an on-chain transaction. We do payments, all kinds of stuff. And for us, base is great because we''re working with large enterprises. They feel comfortable with coin bases on chain and off chain products. They''re building just a lot of good technology for us to use. EVM has a lot of recently, again, I like Solana, but the recent comments about there''s only six smart contracts that matter. It''s not exactly, you know, our ethos there. And there''s a lot of interesting smart contracts and technology already built that''s been time-tested, audited by OpenZeppelin, whatever, on EVM that we can just kind of pull off the shelf and use. So for us, that works. I mean, we were historically on EVM, so that makes it much easier to stay EVM to EVM. We''d have to hire a bunch of new engineers who know Rust to move to Solana. So that''s why we''re over there. And like I mentioned earlier, too, it would be nice to be on the same chain as all the other deep ends, which for the most part choose Solana. But we also want to be next to Cario, which is doing car titles on-chain. They''re on base. I think rentality doing car rentals on-chain. I think they''re also on base. A lot of these other projects, we want to be near the TVL for on-chain car loans and car insurance and other infrastructure like that. So at the end of the day, long term, I think interoperability is solved, and it won''t really matter. Hopefully we get there because this current fractured L2 ecosystem is terrible, and it can''t continue. We can''t really get some real mainstream breakthrough adoption if you have to bridge your tokens all the time and buy different gas tokens and handle that. So hopefully it becomes less relevant over time. Frank, Helium went in the opposite direction to what we see a lot of projects doing today. Interested in your thoughts on that? Yeah. First of all, I''m not the guy that built a blockchain, so I''m probably the least intelligent on blockchains, but I''m a user of blockchains. And we happened at Helium to build our own blockchain eight years ago, seven, eight years ago, called the Helium blockchain, specifically to build wireless networks. We didn''t do it because we wanted to. We did it because at the time there was just no other option. Like Solana and that team with Tully and Raj, they were actually very close to us in San Francisco. They were nearby, but they were just starting as well back in 2017. So it''s not like we had lots of choices where you see that today. So we were forced to build our own chain. And I think we realized after our growth of hotspots went to a million hotspots in a year and a half, all on our entire chain was stored on these hotspots and validators. And it almost killed us like physically. Like we were constantly fixing something and we had no breaks. Our life sucked. And so we really wanted to get out of the blockchain business. That''s not what we''re here for. We''re here to create wireless networks and we''re here to figure out how to get people to use our network. So it was out of scope for us. And so I would argue for people that are building chains that are purpose built, I don''t think you should do it. There''s lots of great tech out there today. You don''t need to go build your own chain. So I''m very against that only because I personally had to live with our team doing that and it sucked. It''s hard. That''s one. And I think overall when I look at Solana versus Ethereum or Polygon or whatever, to me it''s if you don''t understand all that, like I would explain it to my friends as it''s like picking an IBM laptop, a Dell laptop or like a MacBook Pro. It''s either Apple, IBM or Dell. That''s how I see it. They''re all computers. They''re all computers. Which one do you want? Right? And for me, I''m really happy we chose Solana. Right? And I''m biased towards Solana because one, they had a massive developer community. So from a computer perspective, there''s a lot of developers, a lot of people know how to develop on Solana. That means that that chain is supported by other people, not us. So it''s like, great. We don''t have to do the work. Those developers do the work. Fantastic. Get it out of my hands. Right? That''s one big reason. Another is really their ecosystem. They''re just a massive ecosystem with a great marketing machine. So if you join them and you join their ecosystem, that community automatically builds you up. It supports your project. And it''s like free marketing in a way. And so that made a lot of sense for us as well. So I think from our perspective, we were driven out of pain. Like we were living in real pain. We didn''t want to chain anymore. That''s one. You could pick your computer. We chose Solana. We liked it the best. It''s the fastest, the cheapest. They have a massive community that can do the work. So we don''t have to do the work. Their community is great for marketing perspective. So it makes sense to me. Like that''s just like ride the wave with that. And I think ultimately, like I''m also a user of these different chains, right? Like I really like some of the applications on the Ethereum. Like one of the first things I use that''s Ethereum based is this company called Endowment. They''re a donor advisory fund that would that can make donations for you. You can write your taxes off and all that, but you could donate to like anything you want. Red Cross, whatever you''re into, you know, and it was all in Ethereum. I''m going to rush you because we have three minutes left. What I noticed was it''s super expensive. Every donation cost me thousands of dollars because of gas fees. And that''s just really inefficient. I didn''t understand why. I''m hoping that they changed that. But that aside, like that to me was like a big, big X on Ethereum. Let''s do a couple of speed rounds before we wrap up. People come to these conferences hoping to get some secret alpha. So I''m going to ask you each if you have any interesting new deep in projects you see out there. Present company accepted, obviously. Robin? Yeah, I mean, there''s a couple definitely. GeoNet, which we partner with. I think I like their business case. I like their model and the founding team. 375 AI is interesting to me. We''re looking at them quite a bit. Right now I''m personally looking at mainly projects with good synergy to our data. So some different weather type projects. I think could be pretty cool and useful moving into the future. But yeah, right now we''re spending so much time building. So mainly we look when and when we need to partner. There''s also some travel related projects that we''re evaluating like community chain and stuff like that. Okay, Rob? I like a lot of the energy ones especially because we have a lot of EDs on ours and so energy is a natural extension. So Sourceful and Daylight are both awesome. I like Nosh is like a Grubhub alternative. Mike is pretty cool. And I also like Mike from GeoNet as well. GeoNet is a great group. Everybody loves Mike. Yeah, and yeah, I''ll leave it there. Frank? Yeah, I like Sourceful Daylight from a solar aggregation perspective, decentralized solar. And I know at this event I met this really early stage company called KYD Labs. And what they''re doing is they''re essentially building like an exchange for tickets like concert tickets. And they''re figuring out how to allow concert ticket, you know, resellers and venues to really use a platform to arbitrage those tickets, which is really interesting. So that''s like the latest one I learned just from being in the show, which is very cool. Someone needs to hang on Ticketmaster. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Okay, we''re going to wrap it up here. We''re one minute left. But final question since we''re here in Hong Kong with Consensus for the first time. Robin Frank, you''re US based. Robin, you''re in Europe. So do you have any message for the Asian audience? Asia is important for us. We would love to have a bigger community all over Asia. So if anyone has any questions or want to chat with me, catch me outside, I would love to have you on board on the project. Yeah. Our token beat the project to Asia. So we''re on gate and you can interact with us there. But we''d love to meaningfully actually make cars compatible in Asia and bring it to this market. It''s difficult for us as a US team to do that. So we''re looking for partners to, and we have one in one major Asian market that''s going to be launching soon. I can''t mention yet, but it''s very close. And so DEMO is meant to be a true protocol. You can trustlessly run it. And we''re looking for the digital infrastructure, Inc. of different Asian markets to launch and partner with automotive companies and insurance companies. All these car businesses are kind of regional specific. So the best way to take it to market would be with someone local. Frank, final word? Yeah. I''m a Taiwan Sender. So I think the United States is very important. So I hope that one day I can make a business. Thank you. All right. Let''s leave it there. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.', 'Alistair Foster Good afternoon everyone I''m Alistair Foster, CEO of Bullish Capital.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('29a0f92fe0', 'Inspiration from DeepSeek Success for Web3AI', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' First of all, let us welcome our panelists. And why don''t you guys introduce yourself and what are you guys busy with and your initial view on the topic that you want to lay the ground for today''s conversation. Jodi? Jodi. Yeah, of course. Hi, everyone. Good morning and welcome. I''m head of marketing at Hyperbolic, which is a decentralized AI cloud powering infrastructure for leading household names like Hugging Face, NYU, Cornell, Stanford. And we also power a majority of the crypto AI projects today. Our core offerings today include a GPU marketplace. We also provide inference. So that''s AI models. We have about, I think almost 40 models available on our platform today, including DeepSeq. We support the open source AI ecosystem. And so for us, DeepSeq was, you know, music to our ears to hear that we are getting to a place where it''s open source AI is getting super close to closed source models. So yeah. And a little bit about me before joining Hyperbolic. I actually worked at Avalanche where I led product marketing. And I also worked at a crypto wallet before that. Jordan, you''re in a nice construction outfit. Tell us what you''re building. Representing the data builders of public AI. At public AI, we are making it equitable for everybody to contribute their expertise and experience to AI models. We have a full pipeline from sourcing data to verifying it, to applying it to models. And we have all of that backed up with Web3 primitives. So people are doing staking and using reputation systems on chain to be able to verify the quality of the data. Because when you have 500,000 data workers showing up, self-selecting into work, you''re going to have variable quality. So we need those Web3 primitives in control of that quality. So I''m myself at public AI, I''m the CMO. So I''m leading the marketing community and supply side efforts. And prior to this, I have been in Web3 for about five years. I was at Near Foundation where I had the honor of working alongside Ilya Polisukin, famous for the Transformers, attention is all you need paper. He and I were working on DAO software that was used to lock up over 2 billion in assets for critical infrastructure projects. And prior to that, I was a technical program manager at Google. And prior to that, I spent over 10 years in advertising, running a digital innovation lab, servicing Fortune 500 companies. Oh, DeepSeek. DeepSeek is very exciting to us. As AI becomes more and more accessible to businesses, there''s going to be more and more people figuring out how to bring AI to their businesses and needing to have niche data to be able to do that. What we''re seeing is that the data that exists isn''t enough to get things up to production quality for these businesses. So going deeper than the publicly available models is the only way to do it. And the diversity that we have with all those data workers is how we can get that. It''s the only way really that we see. So we think that it''s very exciting. Cheaper technology means it''s in more people''s hands. It''s great for the industry. And it''s a killer use case for Web3 to be so well positioned as AI is rising. Thank you. Thank you. Ming. Hello, everyone. I''m Ming Wu. And I''m the co-founder and the CTO of ZeroG. And ZeroG is a project that''s a target to provide a scalable decentralized AI infrastructure for the Web3 AI workload. And we''re targeting to provide what we call a decentralized AI operating system, which targets to manage the decentralized storage and the computation resources for the applications so that we can easily onboard the AI applications from Web2 to Web3 in a decentralized way. And, of course, we provide very scalable technologies to scale the requirement of the AI workload. And for me, before joining the Web3, I was working in the Microsoft Research Asia for 11 years, mainly research on the distributed system, including all the storage, computation, transaction, and also the AI platform. And later on, I co-founded another blockchain complex with FanLong, which introduced innovative consensus protocol to provide both the high performance and also the high extent of decentralization. And recently, I transferred to the zero G project and because I recently met with our CEO, Michael, and we discussed some new ideas about how to combine AI technology into the blockchain area so that we can have more larger scope of this technology stuff. Yeah. Okay. Maybe this time I ask questions. The other reverse order. So, Ming, as a computer scientist, and, you know, your background remind me a lot of David Ysse, who, you know, initially created the whole Wi-Fi protocol. Now he''s doing Bitcoin layer 2, right? Like, what''s in your scientist mind? Like, how you see, you know, AI, Web3, like, interact? You see that as a natural expansion of technological advancement? Or you feel that, you know, there is, you know, you more look at that from utility perspective and all that? Because you have a very unique entrepreneurship kind of a journey. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think we see that the AI technology is becoming more and more powerful. And currently, AI intelligence can be compatible to the human brain at many, many areas. And so, we think that just because of this, we think that the centralized AI can have a big problem in the future. Because when we apply such advanced AI technologies in the area that will affect the user daily life, it''s very dangerous if we don''t know how this AI model is trained and what''s the original intention that the AI model can have. So, we do believe that we need some transparency to all the control power about this. So that we can have AI and be more aligned to the human intention value. So, can do good things for the human life. And so, we believe that the decentralized technology provided by the blockchain can be a major help on this kind of mission. Because the blockchain technology makes all the data and the computation more transparent to users. And many of them can be verified in a very way. So, and also with high performance blockchain infrastructure, we can keep track the entire cycle of the AI pipeline from the data ingestion, data cleaning, labeling, and also the model training and inference. The whole cycle we can monitor it. And we can measure the honesty of the entire process. And another issue is that the centralized AI may generate a lot of profit and revenue profit. But the distribution of the reward may not be that fair. Because, for example, the open air actually got a lot of revenue by themselves. But they actually crowd a huge amount of data from the internet. But they don''t feedback this reward to those contributors. So, I think we share the same mission with public air maybe. And we think that with this transparency and we have the power to redistribute the revenue generated by the AI to all the contributors from the data and the computation side. So, I think that''s the purpose that we built this. We want to combine AI and the crypto. Thank you, Ming. Jordan, when we talk about AI, people focus on three elements, right? Data, computing power, algorithm. So, is it fair to say public AI focuses more on the data side? And if so, how do you see your effort, your achievement, your direction improves efficiencies relative to, say, your peers in Web 2, as we broadly categorize this, say, scale AI or the other guys? So, I guess from this particular segment, would you like to share your insight? Yeah. As you mentioned, people think about compute and data as big bottlenecks for AI. We aren''t so concerned with compute. One of the examples that my co-founder, Dr. Steven Wong, likes to make is if you have an AI and you''re training it, it''s like giving a student a book. If it''s a good book, they can look at it for a minute or read it once and it''s going to be fine. If you give them a bad book, they can look at it for years and still not learn anything. So, that thinking... Now I realize I have been reading bad books. I''ve figured out a lot of things in life. Too much doom scrolling. Yeah. And then that''s really why our thinking is around the value of data. And it''s something that the Web 2 world has seen. Like, that''s why the Web 2 giants are so easily able to profit off of the data that they''ve been pillaging from their users for so long. So, we really have that thinking around the data being the most valuable part. And the real differentiator that Web 3 is able to provide is the diversity. If you are a centralized, top-down company trying to build an AI, you''re going to be doing it for a specific use case that''s aligned with your interests. And for human diversity to show up and inform those things, you actually need a large set of individual contributors. And that diversity of data is what''s going to get you over the hump of kind of the generic slop that we have today. A lot of our clients have some successful experiments with large language models, but they can''t get it up to the production-grade reliability of 99 or 99.9% that they need to get these things actually running for their companies. And it''s also too expensive to be running large language models for everything. So, by getting the right data, the good books, we''re able to train models that are more efficient to run and do so more reliably than just running the large language models. So, that''s where we''re really providing value and why I think we have, you know, decent revenue to date and are really optimistic about the future. Excellent. Excellent. Charlie, I guess now the question is on your business now. Sounds like you guys are focusing on AI computing cloud. Is that the right description? And if so, relative to those giants that spend, you know, zillions of dollars and zillions of megawatts of power creating this and fearing this AI growth and expansion, what is Hyperbolic is doing and how you''re going to disrupt the status quo here? Yeah, of course. I think, you know, Hyperbolic has received a lot of attention because we have entered a space where there are these Web 2 giants. And we kind of looked at the problem similar how to the Deep Seek AI team probably did. We had constraints in front of us, but we thought, you know what, let''s do things differently. Let''s ditch the middlemen. And that''s why also Web 3 really aligns with our core values, which is about transparency, also equitability, ensuring everyone who contributes in our ecosystem is rewarded. But specifically for our business, the way we''ve been able to differentiate ourselves is just, like I said, ditching the middlemen. So we are a decentralized AI cloud. Our GPU marketplace is one of the many services we offer. And on top of that, we have these inference models, like I also told you about. And what we''re able to do is with these two specific services, we cut costs by 75%. We also have a platform that is fully private. So that''s really important for developers, for example, who want to access Deep Seek, but don''t want to send their data back. And so it''s a serverless platform. And because the platform itself is also really easy to use, we have gained attention from, like, OpenAI''s co-founder who left OpenAI. And he was also the previous director of Tesla AI, Andre Carpathia, one of the biggest names in the Web 2 world. So, yeah, I think just our ethos is to democratize AI access, push AI''s evolution forward, and, yeah, rethink the ballgame. Super. Yeah. We''re here at a consensus in Hong Kong to celebrate Web 3, celebrate crypto and the blockchain, right? But what I''ve experienced is that every single time we say, okay, here we have the solution and the future, then there is always disruption out there, right? Deep Seek is the disruption, right? For us here in Asia, in Hong Kong in particular, we probably don''t have access to OpenAI without VPN and all that. Now here we are, something cheaper, arguably better to a certain extent, and more accessible. So what do you think, you know, as an entrepreneur, as, you know, focusing the talents, focusing this space, you know, what do you value the most? Is it the efficiency, right? Is it the access? Is it the, you know, the censorship proof? You know, other things that you try to distinguish from the centralized business rather than the Web 3 kind of business you guys are building on? So probably, do you have to? Yeah, of course. So, yeah, Deep Seek''s a great example for us of why open source AI is so valuable. I think for us, you know, there''s a couple of things that arise as like an AI cloud, right? Of course, they were able to train the model with less GPUs available, but they were only able to do that because of the constraints that were given to them. They decided they wanted to create a completely new algorithm for reinforcement learning. And so I think for us, when we see that kind of innovation, it excites us because it also allows builders now to go and build agents, applications, whatever that may be. And we like to say, take your wildest dreams, hyperbolic, right? Like we want you to be able to build whatever you want and not have to think about the costs, the scalability, if the model works, if the platform works. Like we want to strip that away for all the developers. And that''s how we''ve been able to garner over 100,000 developers today in the Web 2 world building on hyperbolic. And we''re excited to continue to expand that in the Web 3 space. And like I said, we power a majority of the crypto AI projects today, including some of the most popular agents that you might know, like Virtuals Protocol, Zero Bro, Eliza. The list goes on. So Lang, Arc, there''s a ton. And the reason they trust us is because we have a platform that works, that''s live. And yeah, it''s just easy to use. Okay. So what I hear is open source, open access. Exactly. Super. Jordan? Yeah. For us, the access is key. When more people have access to AI, it means more clients for us. More organizations are figuring out how this technology applies to their businesses. So it''s a very healthy thing to see it so available globally. As far as the efficiency goes, DeepSeek was able to do what they did because they had access to good data. As a quantitative trading firm, they were sitting on years of data that allowed them to very quickly train up a model. And also take advantage of synthetic data along the way. At public AI, we don''t think that you need a human in the loop for every single step. There''s efficiencies to be able to do that. There''s efficiencies to be had by using synthetic data for some steps, using AI for certain decision making, etc. But there are edges where humans still matter. And that''s where we''re capturing value is around those edges where human input and human output are the most valuable things. And that''s why we''re able to actually make it equitable for people to participate in this future where AI is here. It''s not coming. It''s here. And another touch point on access is we were talking earlier, mentioning the fact that AI can be centralized or decentralized or maybe even autonomous. We see it as a gradation where the centralized AI is always going to be in private interest, so it will never be for the people. If we care about humans, we care about people, it has to at least be decentralized where through voting or their own data and interest and expression, they can show up in these models. Our human things that make us human are our languages, our interests, everything shows up in the models. And that decentralization is an essential step for if we get to autonomous, which is still kind of sci-fi. But if we want human values to show up in autonomous, it has to come from people. Otherwise, we will have private interests that are autonomous and those aren''t going to be putting people first. So we really see it as part of the essence of our mission and vision to make sure that humans are represented in these models through their data. Decentralization, autonomy, human existence. Excellent. Let''s go. Let''s go, yeah. Me? I also think that the DeepSea technology actually provides opportunities for people to deploy AI training and inference in the decentralized setup. So basically, because it requires less resources, so that can more easily leverage the decentralized computation power. And also, you know, previously, we were actually working on addressing a lot of challenges to deploy the AI training in decentralized situation. Because in the decentralized situation environment, the network bandwidth is very constrained. And if we use that environment to train a very large scale model, it''s kind of not realistic. But currently, I think with the advancement of DeepSea technology, it makes this decentralized AI pipeline more practical. So I think that''s a good thing. Another thing that I think DeepSea provides is that it actually changed the way that the competition of the model training. For example, because it actually shows the power of the reinforcement learning, drives the exploration of the reasoning process of the model. So that''s it actually, so I think this is the key technology that allows we shrink the model size to have the same level of intelligence of the model. So I think this actually, so previously, there''s no way for the startup and the small group to compete with the large-gen, like OpenAI, right? Because they need a lot of huge amount of resources. Who owns the large amount of GPUs will definitely win. But currently, I think the situation changed a little bit because people are actually thinking how to invent some new reasoning framework to exploit the most value of the model intelligence there. So that means that a small team and more talented people can have more power to contribute in this area. So I think this makes the competition more extensive and more fair in this market. Right. Sounds like the open source, open knowledge base, the open society concept coupled with Web3 participation is the way, at least, to make progress. Yes. When I got the assignment to moderate this panel, I did ask DeepSeek about what would be the inspiration from DeepSeek''s successful Web3 AI. And the smart DeepSeek that we have talked about for the past 20 minutes give the following answer. And I want you to hear this and see whether you agree, whether you would add on those. Would that be the focus for you as an entrepreneur or for business? So that includes 10 things. Bear with me, guys. So data-driven decision-making, scalability performance, user-centric design, security privacy, collaboration, ecosystem building, continuous innovation, regulatory compliance, community engagement, interoperability, ethical AI practice. I feel a lot of this is AI try to fill in 10 points. But, you know, pick any one of these things that kind of echoes with your what do you think about AI, about DeepSeek in general. And probably elaborate that and share with the audience. Yeah. Beautiful. I think at Hyperbolic what really aligned with us was the efficiency. So as I mentioned before, now there are multiple areas that ourself as a business can start to think about. So not only do we have the compute inference, we also have an agent framework that allows for developers to tap into our compute as well as our inference and begin to create agents that can scale, self-replicate, and run autonomously. And so these, I think this part of the business is really exciting because now people will have more money to focus on other areas other than just worrying about the availability of compute and also the cost of the inference model. So I think that''s probably the one that aligns most with us. Yeah. Yeah. What about, say, the security and compliance part? Yeah. You guys are in US. Oh, all of you guys are. But, you know, what''s your angle, you know, how you see that fitting, you know, the current environment, I guess, regulatory-wise? Yeah. You know, it''s funny. There is definitely a, we actually wrote an article about this the other day. There''s obviously the cultural alignment and cultural shift that has happened. And I think we celebrate the fact that this did come out of a constrained environment. And whether or not it came from the US or not doesn''t matter to us as long as it''s moving open source. No, people actually talk about it. We''re from US and all that now. Right. That''s right. So, yeah, that''s a plus, I guess. Yeah, it''s a plus for us. And I think the great thing, too, about having platforms like Hyperbolic and other decentralized platforms is that, and ones that also prioritize privacy, is that you do have options out there to build without being worried about sending your data to the wrong place. So, at Hyperbolic, if you were to tap into our APIs, they''re serverless, and they''re fully private, so you don''t have to worry about that. Got it. Thank you. Yeah, cool. Jordan? Yeah, from my perspective, I think that the UX angle is especially interesting because that was kind of the tipping point where we went from, oh, GPT is kind of a cute, interesting computer science kind of thing, to, oh, everybody can suddenly chat with it, and it makes sense, and people understand why this is so powerful. So, UX is a critical point, and to be able to iterate on UX quickly with AI in the loop means that, for us, our clients are learning what this could mean for their businesses easier, so we''re able to service them easier. They understand how it fits easier. We can use AI in that loop. And then, from the other UX point of view, there isn''t one point of alignment for AI because there isn''t one point of alignment for humans, and that is the beauty of humans is that we are diverse, and that''s why it''s amazing when we bring people together from different countries and see competition between them. It can be seen as negative, but it''s actually healthy for everything moving forward together. So, whenever I hear people trying to reach one point of alignment for AI, that''s always a concern for me, and that''s why for AI to be meaningful and for it to be accessible to everybody, we need decentralized inputs to this, and to run decentralized and for it to make money for people in a decentralized way. Otherwise, it''s meaningless to humans, so Web3 is the only way to drive AI forward in an equitable way that we can see. Thank you. Yeah, so I want to add some comments on the regulatory compliance aspect. So, I think the key to help on this kind of thing is to give the AI or agent the ID and all the ownership, and also the ownership. So, the ID actually may give this agent a responsibility, and the ownership may give the agent some access control stuff. So, by doing this, actually, this is also relevant to some stuff that we are working on in Zero-G. So, basically, we think that the way to achieve that is to combine, to bond the agent with specific NFT so that it can have the on-chain identification and also have the ownership to some wallet address of users. And, but, we realized that it cannot use the traditional standard NFT, the current standard of NFT because the agent data, which could be the model, the memory, and the character, are valuable data. And, it should not be maintained in a public way so that we need to introduce some privacy-preserving technology around it. And, so, this gives us a challenge that how we can design NFT protocol that allows the enable to transfer with this privacy data. So, that''s, to achieve that, we propose a new NFT standard that we call iNFT, intelligent NFT, and with an innovative protocol that allows the users to transfer this valuable private agent model, agent data. And, also, we are going to work on the marketplace on top of this technology so that we can have the OpenSea counterpart in the agent world. Nice. So, we are approaching the end of the panel. So, very quickly for each of every one of you. So, what would be the question you ask AI when you try a new AI agent or, you know, when you invite folks to try your apps or try your site? What would be that one question? Jodi? Sorry, could you clear that up a bit more? No, like, you know, guess what''s the weather today? You know, what would be the stock, you know, where Bitcoin is going to be next month? What would be that single one question you want to ask AI about? I don''t know if you guys have tried this, but if you ask how many R''s are in strawberry, I usually get that one wrong. Okay. Jordan? Redacted. I always read Team B censorship resistibility. Yeah. Cool. So, I often use the AI for translation. Yeah. I guess we all read, most of us read, what''s that, Hitchhack''s Guide to Galaxy? Yeah. Ultimate Question 42. So, with that, we end this panel. And, wow. For us, happy trading for you guys. Happy AI development.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('does_crypto_have_a_culture_', 'Does Crypto Have a Culture_', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' Music Actually, the sound came out nice too. Is it? Have you guys, who here has seen this joycat on social before? Who here holds a mog? Or has held some mog? Come on. Okay, okay, okay. We got some moggers in here. We got some moggers here. How is everyone doing, ConsenSys? Everyone good? Hold on. This is snooze fest. How is everyone doing, ConsenSys? Everyone good? Yeah. There we go. There we go. All right, listen. Pedro''s on his way. He''s somewhere here running around. We got Mike. We got Seb. It''s so fun here. Seb, why don''t you give us a quick, quick, like, little intro, who you are, what you do? Yep. My name''s Seb. I''m the founder and CEO of Sofon. Sofon is a blockchain, new blockchain, focused completely on consumer and entertainment. And before that, I was, there we go. Mike''s better. There we go. I was a leader at ZK Sync Matter Labs for several years. Wow. I didn''t know that. That''s pretty cool. Yep. Love that. Mike, I mean. Yes, sir. For CT, you need no intro, but this ain''t CT, so I''m going to need a little introduction. My name''s Mike Three. I''m an artist. I work with MogCoin. I''m, like, their active creative director. I love that. I love that. I just can''t get over the mask because it''s so fun. Listen. It sounded a lot good on paper. Like, I can''t see a thing, but I hope it''s enjoyable. You can''t see anything. Enjoyable. There''s, like, thousands of people right now. Don''t stress. Anyways, look. A topic that comes up a lot here in this industry is the C word, culture. We love to talk about culture, but very few people actually seem to understand it. Another key word is onboarding. We love to say we''re onboarding people, but we''re terrible at keeping the people who are on board. Study the Argentina coin, right? We onboarded the masses only to rock them all and leave them with nothing, which is pretty sad. And here we have some builders that are actually properly onboarding in different levels and trying to keep the people on. So I want to discuss in depth, like, you get the people in the space. How do we keep them sad? You''re on the chain side. There''s a lot of blockchains. There''s a lot of blockchains. Like, oh, why more L2, why more L2? But how are you guys at Sofon doing the work to not only onboard, but keep the people in the space? So for us, it''s, we actually never really talk publicly. I mean, we''re at a crypto conference, so we can discuss it here. But normally, we''ll never talk about crypto or blockchains when it comes to end products on Sofon. The goal is to have all of that invisible, to be in the background as much as possible. And there''s a very deep and intense focus on design, on branding, on the user experience that we can give on the front end, right? Crypto is great. Most front ends suck. Too many clicks. Too many buttons. Yeah. Too many complicated user experiences. So everybody that we work with, we take a very deep, deep partner success, partner engineering journey to have this design-led experience so that you can bring the next wave of people on chain, right? And I call it like forking Web2. We''re trying to bring, you know, we''re forking the intuitiveness that people have with Web2 user flows and just baking in crypto to the background one step at a time. So really account extraction. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because there''s so many buttons, right? Yeah. I think to make a transaction, I met a mask with something like 70 buttons. You got to click and then you''re there. So the people are kind of lost in between. Quickly, Pedro. What up? How you doing? I''m good. You''re not sweating. You''re good. You''re looking good. Don''t worry. The hair is still nice. I look great in sweats. It''s a big venue. It is a big venue. Like I found out the worst way. So Pedro, give us a little introduction for the people. Yeah. So Wallet Connect has been like a staple brand in the crypto industry for seven years. Big. But most importantly, it has provided the infrastructure for essentially every wallet and every blockchain to just provide a great user experience. And I saw you already mentioned about account abstraction. That''s a huge topic to onboard people. And I''m really happy that we''re actually getting there. So you said we''re actually getting there, but why are we not there yet? Well, you can''t just like change the infrastructure of like 100 million people in a day. Right. Even wallets who are very happy to onboard people through account abstraction, it requires a lot of work for them. You know? And they have to do it in a way that doesn''t upset their customers. It doesn''t upset their partners. And they have to do it in a way that it''s beneficial for everyone. And there''s too much nuance in account abstraction, right? Yeah. I do agree with that. There''s too much nuance. So like, what do you think the next steps in that would be? What are some things that you''d like to see from the wallet that you work with? I feel like with wallets, what we''re working with them is essentially trying to agree of what it would look like for the user experience. Because even though people understood that like account abstraction is the right approach, it doesn''t necessarily mean we actually agree on how that looks like in the future. And for me, it should look like just as an invisible login where account abstraction happens underneath the hood and you don''t even need to know why. And right now, we''re trying to aim to a better Wallet Connect experience where you connect your wallet once and you forget about it. Because right now, you can''t forget about your wallet. Like the wallet is screaming at you, sign this transaction, go here, do that, approve this, and there''s gas. Like there''s just too much thing screaming in your face. It kind of ruins the experience of the app. Yeah, it does. Mike, you and I talked about this a little bit behind the scenes, but you know, with all this account abstraction, then how do we actually get people involved in our culture, right? I think, Mog, one thing I personally like about you guys is that you''re one of the first real like culture coins in a way. But like for you, how do we actually get people hooked on our culture? Because we can say culture all we want, but you know. Yeah. I mean, I think, I mean, maybe it''s important to define like what we mean by culture. First, I think it''s like a shared set of beliefs. Yeah. Like values that we hold and then like artifacts and maybe like practices. I think it''s been thinking about this a lot, actually. It''s interesting. There''s like a culture shock going on right now where you have like crypto natives and people have been in it for, you know, maybe a decade or more with a lot of new entrants that don''t necessarily share the same ethos of like decentralization and caring about like a freedomless or a freedom to transact in like a permissionless way. Yeah. So I don''t know. I think it''s interesting with like just the idea that like they''re not even interacting with the blockchain in the same way that you used to. You know, they might sign a transaction to set up a wallet and then the next transaction that they''ll sign is to like off ramp. So like I wonder like, I don''t know what the answer is there, but it''s interesting because like there''s definitely like a, just like a being out of sync, I think, you know. What is culture then in that sense in our space? What''s crypto culture? What''s so different? What''s different between what? Like our culture. Like what is it to be part of the crypto culture to? Well, I mean, again, I think it''s, I think the root of it is a decentralization ethos and like just the idea that you can, you know, anyone anywhere can like send, receive and like store value without, you know, a third party of some kind, like a bank or, you know, government or whatever. I think that''s like the root of it. And then also just the idea that you''re like building collaboratively without like a top-down hierarchy. Yeah. In an open way and kind of like gaining consensus as you, as you do that. I think that''s like pretty foreign. And I think a lot of the friction happens with like having expectations of new participants that, you know, maybe are unfair. Yeah. Cause like, you know, how are we on, we''re onboarding them. We talk about that a lot with like financial incentives, but like, how are we onboarding them culturally or like philosophically? Like if you talk about like what matters to like the crypto culture, I think it''s, you know, again, I don''t know what the answer is, but I feel like the tools themselves could like maybe lend themselves to sharing that experience and that ethos with them. Um, even in the case where you''re like sacrificing, um, security, uh, and self sovereignty for like, um, speed and ease of use, you know, I think that''s a good trade off to make in some cases. Um, and I, I guess I would just say like, also like, uh, it''s better to have people on chain, like, uh, performing transactions in that way. Um, it''s easier to onboard them into the culture if they''re, you know, maybe transacting, you know, in a way that''s low friction. So, Seb, it seems you wanted to add to that. Yeah. I think, would you say in a very like CT native way that you''re, that crypto culture is kind of making money together? It seems to me like if you look at CT and, uh, anything that kind of becomes cultural there, it''s when communities shape and form like Mog did for instance, and people kind of like ride it together, make money together, and they''re not getting, uh, getting rugged, right? I feel like we''re losing money together right now. It goes both ways. But you''re in it together, right? And like the biggest, you know, maybe like the last, uh, six, 12 months, uh, the hype launch was, uh, was the phenomenon that made people the most money. Yeah. Because the airdrop made people a lot of money. But then typically when something launches and there''s an airdrop, people make money, then they sell and then it''s kind of cooked. So what made it that they all... Because it launched low enough that people could, even if you didn''t use hype or you didn''t participate in the airdrop, you could still buy it and, um, continue to make money with it, right? Because they launched at a relatively low valuation. And then everybody becomes a community member, right? And I feel like that, or in the case of Mog, for instance, because there''s a lot of meme coins, right? Most of them are shit. Most of them are going up and back down or, you know, people... Last like two hours. Last two hours. But the ones that have, uh, that have legs that can actually be considered, uh, kind of blue chips like Mog, like Pepe, like Doge. You know, they have huge communities of people that have made money together and then they become spokespeople for those, um, projects. Is that how you guys try and approach it with SoFan? Yeah, definitely. I mean, our go-to-market for our particular, um, for the chain, for the token will be to launch quite low. Arthur Hayes wrote about it last week. You know, you gotta let people make money with your, with your token, right? So I think it''s definitely very important. Um, there''s not much of a meme coin culture on SoFan because I think like, to be honest, if you''re going to launch a meme coin today, you should do it on Solana. That''s where most of the liquidity is. Us, it''s much more focused on very end, uh, end user applications, whether it''s like social stuff, gaming, lots of different sectors. Um, but I think for like meme and very culture driven, uh, tokens, you know, Solana is a great place to do it. Yeah. I mean, Solana''s kind of become the casino, right? Yeah. And I feel like the other chains are just most focused on, on apps in that sense. Yeah. Pedro, you know, for you guys, it''s a bit different. It''s interesting this panel because what I like is that we have, you know, on the wallet side, right? You guys power like every wallet. They have a proper meme coin that''s been around for longer than 16 hours. And actually what, a year and a half now? Almost two, two years this summer. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have Seb here who''s building an entire chain, which actually has real users, which is super cool. But on the wallet side, like how do you guys approach building a brand and this, this, this culture within the space? Because we don''t really interfere with wallet connect as a brand, but we all use wallet connect. Yeah. So how do you approach that? I think that wallet connect, the best analogy that you can make is a little bit like Visa. Okay. Like Visa and MasterCard are not brands that you interact with. No. But you use every day. Yeah. And every bank relies on them for pretty much every payment that we use like on a daily basis, whether it''s buying a flight ticket to go to Hong Kong or to pay for coffee. It''s something that just exists and you trust it because it''s everywhere. And it''s making sure that you have a safe and seamless experience. That''s what we''re trying to entail, that as long as you use wallet connect, you will have a great experience. And you are not bound by any partner that we have. We support 600 wallets. Wow. Pretty much in every application, every layer one. We just want to make sure that you can enjoy crypto safely and seamlessly. How many users? Right now, we''ve almost hit 40 million. What the fuck? That''s crazy. 40 million people. Yeah. Have used wallet connect. And the interesting thing about wallet connect is because we''re an infrastructure project, we do not count on-chain traffic. In fact, we are private, so we actually don''t know how much money you own in your wallet. It''s designed like this for privacy. But we do know the exact number of wallets. And these are not addresses on-chain, which many people can have 10 or even 100 addresses. These are actual users. That''s 40 million. 40 million mobile phones. Wow. Wow. What do you... I mean, wow, but in a way, that''s also early. Yeah. Right? I think we''re just getting started. When did you start wallet connect? Well, the very first wallet connect was March 2018. So we''re almost reaching our seven-year anniversary next month. Seven years, 40 million. Where do you see you guys going next year? Well, if we''re not hitting a billion, we''re not doing our job right. True. Yeah. Because we''re not here to compete for the best wallet or the best app or even the best blockchain. Like, we''re really here to grow the ecosystem as a whole. And to touch on, like, what is crypto culture for us? It''s openness. It''s borderless. It''s really unbounded enjoyment of the internet. I love that. I love that. What do you think, Mike? What do you think we''re doing wrong? Because right now, the meme-kun mania has hit this kind of... I don''t want to call it a peak because I don''t like to call top. It''s not who I am. If you know me, you know I''m always bullish. But, like, something went wrong here, clearly. I feel like the whole space reset. Yeah. I mean, I don''t know. Like, again, there''s this, like, culture shock of, like, it going mainstream and everyone being really excited about that. But people are coming in and, you know, they don''t necessarily share the same values. And I think onboarding people with, like, solely with just financial incentive is probably it. You know? Has the financial incentive gone too far? Yeah. Like, how do we, like, onboard people culturally and, like, introduce them to, like, the shared values? And it''s fine, I think, if, like, the financial incentive is what draws people in. And then the ease of use of different tools, that''s all great. But, yeah. Like, maybe, you know, I don''t know. Maybe the tools can help share the ethos better. Maybe the community can be more welcoming. And, like, you know, just having a clear path for someone who does want to enter, that''s not always the case. You know? Like, I don''t think people know, like, half the time. Like, all the, you know, the subculture metas and, you know, I mean, even in just crypto broadly, like, it''s gotten so big that there''s subcultures within the subculture itself now. So, I don''t know. I think probably just. It''s like so many different pockets, right? More inclusivity maybe. Yeah. I don''t know. You guys are obviously most focused on. It''s like even each chain almost has its own culture, subculture, right? Like, you have the Bitcoiners. You have the Ethereum heads. I mean, you guys are on ETH. Even within ETH, you have all the different chains and L2s. Do you find that tough? Because, like, there''s this often, like, now this criticism in the space has so many chains, so little apps. So, how do you guys navigate that? Yeah. I definitely think ETH for me is, I''m always in ETH Maxi because I think it''s where all of the innovation happens, right? A lot of the builders, a lot of the new things that have come out over time have happened within the Ethereum ecosystem, not necessarily others. But L2s generally were like a breeding ground for experimentation. A lot of different engineering companies came up and they open source their stacks and they just give, again, the tools for people to be able to build at the application layer, right? To go up. What does that do? It also creates some kind of fragmentation. It fragments liquidity. It can fragment cultures. It creates subcultures. So, there''s like a good in, you know, it''s kind of like the price to pay, right? But overall, for me, I see it as a good thing. I think I''m very bullish on the way that I look at the world and my team looks at the world because we only focus on, we''re a product-led company, not an engineering-led company. We''re not trying to build a new ZK proof system. We just, we take the tech that we think is the best and then we build products first with a very, very empathetic focus on design, UI, UX, on those primitives. And I think that that''s the mentality that you have, that you have to have if you want to get new folks on chain, like kind of like the next wave of people on chain. People who are used to using Web2 flows but are not going to learn the typical Web3 flows that we have now, which are a little bit cumbersome. So, what are some apps, I mean, maybe there''s aspiring founders or users in the audience or online because I know we''re streaming live online as well. What are some apps that you''d like to see built on your chain? The big focus for us going forward is to build in-house what''s called the SoFund Data Hub. So, it uses a piece of infrastructure called ZKTLS, which essentially allows you to take and pull data from Web2 applications and verifiably prove them but in a private way on chain. So, you can let people sign in with their Spotify, their Uber, their Ticketmaster account, whatever. And then you essentially build what I call a social oracle on chain. And at SoFund, we''re building a data hub for this. So, users can sign in with all different kinds of accounts. They get rewards for it. There''s a loyalty program that goes with it. And then people are going to build different kinds of, let''s say, entertainment or social applications that can pull this data. And the possibilities are endless. You could build prediction markets on top of it. You could build loyalty programs. I mean, the big thing in crypto is that people have wallets. They don''t have accounts. And in Web2 space, you have an account, right? Think of Linktree. We''re building the Linktree for people to come on chain in a way where you link all of your different IRL, social or consumer-focused applications. And then, as a crypto company, if you want to work with someone, I can tell you, well, I know who my users are. I know how they''re behaving. It''s not just wallet one, wallet two, wallet three. There''s actually an account. And I think people care about accounts in the Web2 space. And you need to sort of bring this back into the Web3 space as well. What do you think of that? I mean, I feel like you guys can relate to that. Yeah. Accounts versus wallets. I really like the terminology, right? Because too many times people confuse accounts and wallets and wallets and accounts. But it''s not really true. A wallet should be essentially the partner with the user to manage its accounts, not to be the owner of that account. Like, the user should be able to actually have its account everywhere. And the account might look different in an application or another. And the wallet is just there to facilitate that experience to manage their digital identity, which the account is associated. And yes, the user might have multiple accounts because all of us have, like, our DGN personality and our more proper personality. And then those would be two separate accounts. But then even those accounts have different contexts on different applications. And the wallet is just there to tie it all together so that you still keep the control and the choice and the composability in the Internet. No, this is so true. I kind of want to ask you guys each, like, because we still have quite some time left. Like, you know, I''ll start with you, Pedro, since we''re talking. Like, what''s something that really excites you most about what you guys are building? And maybe something that you want people to pay attention to coming for Wallet Connect? Yes. I know you also, I think, you know, there was a token launch recently, etc. So we launched the token in November, but it''s still not transferable. So people are really excited to actually start trading WCT. But since then, we actually built, like, a large community. We have, like, 200,000 token holders. About, like, 30% of them are currently staking. We have about 10% of the supply already staked. We have 16 node operators. Wow. I think the most exciting part about what we''ve been growing is actually this superior user experience around smart sessions. And smart sessions will really remove the idea that the wallet needs to get in the way. What''s a smart session? So a smart session is when you connect to your wallets, too many times the wallet is asking you, approve this transaction, approve this message. It''s like everything that used to take, like, one or two steps became a 10-step process. So the smart session tends to automate this by creating a policy engine that will allow the Walletknack network to protect you from malicious activity, but not have to ask the user every time to approve every single transaction. And that way, the experience is going to be much better because nobody wants to be reviewing every single transaction. Some of these transactions are pure nonsense for the average user. And we just need to make sure that the users are safe and they can enjoy without the hustle of approving every transaction. That''s awesome. That''s actually pretty smart. You know, it''s kind of annoying when your MetaMask always pops up every time you open a new link and just asks you to sign more. And sometimes it scares you. Yes. Like, wait, something''s wrong here, right? Mike, what about you? On the mock side, you guys are almost two years in running, which is kind of rare for a meme coin, not going to lie. Dogecoin set quite the standards. What, 10 years old? But now, like, the average meme coin is 10 minutes old. Right. You know, so, like, what excites you more about, like, what you guys got? I mean, you guys kind of, you got Coinbase. So, from then, it''s like, now what? You know? What excites you most about being part of the, of mock? Um, I mean, I think it''s attracted, like, such a cool group of people that''s not PvP at all. Um, like, super talented artists and builders and, uh, people are just super bullish about crypto in general. Uh, so continuing to help proliferate that meme, um, that''s kind of emerged organically. Uh, because mog wasn''t a meme to begin with. It''s just a verb. Uh, and that slang, for people who don''t know, um, is really just kind of, uh, you know, winning, performing your best, kind of, like, best in your competition. Um, but it''s not competitive, like, aggressively in that sense. Like, it is kind of just bullish for crypto in general. Yeah. Um, like, laser eyes being, like, the, uh, no, or pit vipers being, like, the laser eyes of the cycle. Like, kind of, like, that vibe. Um, so just continuing to help. Yeah, you got pit vipers right there, front row. You know, peripherally right there. So, it''s kind of become, like, a staple. It''s actually fun how you guys have turned, like, just some coin into kind of, like, a, you know, you see someone with the vipers outside. Like, oh, shit. Like, he''s, like, mogging. Yeah, like, are they holding? Yeah, are they holding? And they may not even know what the hell it is, but I feel like it''s, like, direct association. I wonder if you guys actually increased their sales. Yeah, these guys. Um, I''m pretty sure we did. I''m pretty sure you guys did. Seb, for you, what excites you most about, like, talk to me more about what you got coming up, you know, on Sofon. What are you most excited about? And also, how can people, you know, interact with it? So, we''re going to be building out and putting online this whole Sofon data hub that I was telling you guys about. We also recently announced the SIA, the Sofon Intelligence Agency, because we had to have AI baked into what we were doing one way or another. So, we put up $5 million from our treasury to sponsor different kinds of AI protocols who are launching on Sofon. We just announced a big partnership with Codex, which is basically, like, a big AI agent marketplace, similar to virtuals a bit, I would say, which is built on Sofon. And they just launched their token on base and Ethereum as well last week. So, going live with this. And we''ll be doing our TGE soon. So, Sofon has a completely gasless experience. The Sofon token powers the chain. We technically launched the token last year, but just like the guys at Wallet Connect, it''s non-transferable, so it''s not priced yet. We have a pretty big community since we did a node sale last year, right? So, we did the largest node sale that a blockchain has done so far, which is... That was nuts. That was a big one. That was around... What was that, $15 million? $65. $65. Sorry. I just left $15 million out. That was better. And so, all of those guys are OG community guys, right? And so, they''re going to get a lot of tokens coming in on day one when we list the token, which will be quite soon. That''s a lot of fun. This is up. Yep. So, where''s best for people to find you guys? Pedro. Because that was such a fascinating conversation. I kind of want people to be able to follow you guys around. Best on X? Yeah. What are you... Mostly on X. And you can find Wallet Connect by just typing Wallet Connect. And my username is pretty much everywhere. Doesn''t matter if it''s Farcast or Lens or X. You can find it at Pedro UID. And yeah. Keep it up with the updates at Wallet Connect because we have a lot of things coming in March. They do, actually. I heard they''re doing something pretty cool with our prediction market platform soon. So, I know a guy. I know a guy who told me Wallet Connect and Rug Radio and Myriad will be partnering pretty shortly. What about you, Mike? Just Mike 3 on X? My favorite meme maker, too, by the way. Mogcoin, at Mogcoin on X. Okay. Mogcoin as well. Check out Mogcoin. Yeah, yeah. And SoFan is very simple. Send a ticker, man. Just send a ticker. Yeah. What''s the ticker? Ticker''s Mog. What about you? On X. On X. Easy. SoFan. I''m very quick. There you go. All right. That was us. Shout out to Wallet Connect. Mog, SoFan. Thank you for having us, Hong Kong. Peace out. Thanks, Marouk. fer has got beads. He is always efficacious. There it is. It goes back to Wallet Connect. Thanks, Marouk. There he is. He is in the email list. That was done here. It goes back to Wallet Connect anytime. In all times makes sense. You have to go off line.

How''s everyone doing? You good? We''re good. All right, let''s get a little quick line of intros. I think this is the fun one. I think. This is the one about meme coins, right? Yeah, okay. This is definitely the fun one. You want to maybe a quick line of intros? Start with you. Sure. Hi, everyone. Alan Lau, CBO of Animoca. So we''re one of the biggest investors in Web3, 600 companies in the portfolio. Quite a lot of AI, not as many memes. Very happy to talk about this today. I think everybody has heard of Animoca and Hong Kong. I mean, this is like, this is your turf. It is. You''re playing home game here. It''s unfair. I know. Welcome to my town, finally. We don''t have to travel for a conference. Yeah, first time, right? It feels amazing. Benjamin Quinlan, CEO of Quinlan & Associates. We''re a strategy consultancy specializing in financial services. We do a lot of work in the Web3 space as well, primarily on the institutional side of Web3. So this is going to be a very interesting discussion that we can unpack. I was also the former chairman of the FinTech Association of Hong Kong. And I have a lot of other roles that I hold here with government, quasi-government entities. All right, everyone. My name is Kevin. I''m the chief business officer of Gates.io. For all of you, it''s like property things. Gates.io is more like a meme exchange. So like a pretty on point for the topics to date. We don''t operate here in case like the SFCs like still have the people around here like sticking around. But I just want to bring good love to you guys. Let''s just like a little bit more like a sharing section. I love that. Yeah. Hi, GM guys. I am me. I represent Puffverse. This is a GameFi project. So not exactly meme coin. But yeah, we''ll see what the discussion is going to be about. Animoke is invested in us. We''re going with Gates.io event later tonight if you want to party. We have a K-pop band later. So yeah, just here to have fun and discuss crypto. Hell yeah. I mean, yeah. Sorry. There you go. All good. Oh. Yeah, these are tough. Take two. Okay. There you go. Okay, GM, GM guys. Again, this is Miko. I represent Puffverse, a GameFi project that Animoke invested in. And we are, yeah, we''re going to discuss meme coins now. And yeah, looking forward to this. So meme coins are in a funny spot, huh? Especially after the last rug. That was, you know, quite a rug. The Libra coin from the Argentina coin. And I think that they reset a lot of the table when it comes to this industry. I think it caused a lot of trouble and it hit a big reset button, right? But let me ask you. I mean, you guys have been in crypto for a long time. I think all of you. Is there a lasting market for memes for real? Because Dogecoin is, what, 10 years old now? Yeah. That one, that''s the king. That''s the big one of memes. But is there really a lasting market for meme coins, your opinion? Honestly, when I first hear about the topic of this talk, I''m like, isn''t this kind of old why we still talk about memes? But I guess there''s always surprises, right? There''s always surprises. Libra and all that, right? And honestly, even the Trump coin has only been for a month, right? Wait, what? I''ve aged 10 years since that one. I know, it feels like 10 years, right? So if you think about what is meme coin, right, it really is asset formation around communities, right? So, you know, it''s interesting you said Dogecoin has been around for many years and that''s because the community is still thriving, right? I mean, they''re adding meaning, they''re, you know, bonding together and doing things and that''s why the coins still exist, right? So, you know, I think meme coin is nothing more than, you know, asset around community and, you know, as long as the community is going, the coin will still be here. Yeah. Do you think there is a lasting word? I mean, you''re from the gate side, so you guys see a lot of meme coins. Well, yeah, I''ve never been so wrong about a sector. It''s like whenever I want to buy, there''s like dumping. Whenever I want to sell, it''s just like Trump happens. I guess, and I come from like a 15 years traditional finance background, right? So I was like, okay, this meme coin thing is like, what is this? But it just happened to me that when I talk to the people that invest in the meme coins, they know what they''re doing. They want it quick. They want it to be like just like thematic. They don''t want utilities. Like if you have a meme coin and you talk about utilities, like, all right, no, I want the one that''s like quick turnover. I guess as there''s like also a personal opinion and an exchange opinion. And the exchange opinion is like we are a platform to provide a fair access for everyone to buy and sell. We don''t have a crystal ball like what''s the next meme or meme coins going to 100 eggs. But like to have access for our users to actually invest into it is the key. So that''s why we''re doing it. And Ben, let me ask you because you come from the institutional side, right? Trump launches a meme coin two days before the inauguration. Wait, how many of you guys bought the Trump coin? Did you guys buy it again? How you guys made money? Then you guys shouldn''t be here. You''re rich now. There you go. No, but you know. Put it all back in the Libra. Oh my God. Don''t even get me started on that one. So Trump launches a meme coin literally two days before he gets into the White House. What message do you think that sends to the world? I don''t think it''s about creating this institutional meme coin. I think it''s about a recognition by Trump that people that follow what he does and support what he does are heavy investors in this space. And it''s an easy mechanism to actually raise money. What signal does it send? Maybe an issue of who''s more gullible. But I also think there''s a mechanism in there that basically says if you back what I do, if you wrap your investment around this theme, as it is with most other themes and memes, you''ll do well. And it''s up to you how you want to get in or get out. I think when it comes to any discussion around a meme coin, it''s pointless to talk about what they do, what utility they add. We''re never going to lie to each other here. It''s a complete and utter waste of time. So overall, you''re in there to make a very speculative investment. You''re hoping to get out at the right time, provided, as was said before, there''s enough of a market to sustain that demand and ride that community. Sure. If you can get out, no problem. But for every millionaire that''s made, there''s a lot of people that get burnt and lose everything. What do you think? Yeah. And from a project standpoint, to see the leader of the free world launching meme coins is, well, the meme coin itself is not exactly like something that you would have like intrinsic value or something like that. But the bigger message here is that the environment has been more friendlier right now than ever before. Like if back a few years ago, we were worried about the long crypto winter, now we''re here and now we are at 100k at Bitcoin and like so many opportunities to raise capital. And I think it''s open season right now. But of course, you have to be cautious because there are always some cautionary tales, not just in meme coins, but with all crypto projects. So because it''s open season, are you guys not a little concerned about the landscape as it is now? And the fact that everything''s so quick, right? On the panel earlier, we were talking about how like, you know, like we opened with Dogecoin. Do you think there can be even another Dogecoin in this landscape? Because stuff lasts like 10 seconds. Yeah. I think it''s pretty tough because people get into meme coin for community, for a chance to make money. But I think on the premise that this is a fair launch, right? That there are no major insider and all of us have lived through this, you know, about half a year ago, there''s a really big backslash against VC coins, right? Because people say, I don''t want, you know, VC to dump on us later on. And, you know, meme coin is supposed to be the anti of that, right? And unfortunately, with the recent couple of launches, it wasn''t really the case, right? So, you know, I think people come to this for a playbook, for a chance to speculate, but it looks like the playbook wasn''t really what they signed up for, right? So it''s kind of hard to see how this continues. And if you look at the stats for Trump coin, yes, quite a lot of people that are early make money. But, you know, if you look at the stats, a lot of people just break even or quite a lot of people lose money as well, right? So I don''t think that feels like a mass onboarding event after all. What do you guys think? Let''s expand on that. Look, the reality is the crypto industry is no stranger to creating new three-letter acronyms to make and trade money. Memes are just the next evolution. It was ICOs, IEOs, NFTs. And you will always see winners or, you know, projects that come out the other side still existing. That''s the fact. But a lot of things turn to absolute dog vomit. Am I concerned? No, because we''ve seen this again and again and again. And I think the whole premise around caveat emptor and do your own research and you make money, you make money, you lose money, you lose money. I mean, there''s nothing unusual about this. But I think regulators are getting more and more aware that this is causing potential issues. But the U.S. has thrown a spanner in the works in terms of saying this is a bit more of a free-for-all. There will be a regulatory regime that comes around it. The other side with meme investing is, look, even if you look at GameStop, right? You remember that saga that happened a few years back? It''s about the power of a community. A community can move markets, whether it''s an intangible asset with no intrinsic value or an actual share, right? That''s the power of the community. And I think people realize this. And the ability to harness this in today''s digital social media age means that people have a lot more control, let''s say to speak, of the way that a market may move, right? And how they participate in it. So let me ask you, Kevin, do you think this meme coin culture mania is kind of the new media? We sat here with Lockshare. They were talking about media, prediction markets, all the way. Well, that''s the thing, right? So like meme as a cultural concept is not, it didn''t start with meme coin, right? It didn''t even start with like internet cat''s pictures. It''s a concept actually from 1976 when like Richard Dawkins, oh, he didn''t know that. No, tell me more. It''s from the book, it''s from the book, The Selfish Genes, where like he''s more like a biologist, talk about genes. And then he just like make a theory about like actually memes will work just like genes for DNA. But like you can propagate with like books and music and movies and now the internet, right? So it''s a really old concept. And I think meme, like, well, sorry I''m saying that''s because you interviewed Trump. But like President Trump is the prime example of like being a meme. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah. He''s like, so his name to someone else to build a tower for him. He brought his way into Home Alone 2. It was on like WWF and like Saturday Night Knife, right? Yeah. He, everything he does make him the most powerful person in this planet. Yeah. Twice around. So I guess that''s some meme values in it, I assume. Yeah. What makes a good meme? What makes you want to buy a meme? Well, I''m not really sure. Like, I guess if the charts go up. Yeah, we all like the chart to go up though. We tend to go down a lot lately. Yeah, but yeah, back to the question about memes being new media. Well, I think it''s, I consider it as a part of a continuum. Like, if we go back before, like when TV was, television was newly invented, what the definition of traditional media back then was radio and newspapers. Yeah. And when TV became mainstream and, you know, national media and then the internet was on the rise, then suddenly TV is traditional media. 20 years down the line, internet might be the traditional media and there might be new ways for us to consume media. Maybe we transmit signals to each other''s brains at that point. I''m not sure. But the point is, it''s a continuum and right now, I guess it will ultimately depend on the people who are behind these meme coins and even the bigger crypto industry to determine, like, what role they''ll have in shaping the image of the new media. Especially in conjunction with how memes and how we all communicate in social media. Some of us have even attempted to create web-free versions of social media to varying levels of success or lack thereof, to be honest. But the important thing is that we keep working, we keep moving forward, we keep exploring innovations. So I just say this from a project standpoint, I guess. I think traditional media in general is just getting crushed. And the reality is people understand that the objectivity that once stood for traditional media is no longer there. It''s so bifurcated in terms of what you watch CNN on one end, Fox on the other end. It''s crazy. So people have an inherent mistrust in media. And the reality is these platforms where each of us are now publishers gives the power to individuals to actually put out what they want. The big fear with that is that sometimes I feel like we have more access to information than ever before. But as a society, we''re more stupid than ever before. It''s unbelievable to look at the anti-intellectualism that comes with the wave of people having autonomy over what they put out and how much they can control the narrative. And it''s not to say there is an absolute right and wrong of everything. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. But when what you would call contra or tangential opinion becomes mainstream because people now have the ability to drive that narrative, it''s quite dangerous. I think meme is really the crystallization of that. It really is a democratization, decentralization of media. Everyone had a voice. Everyone can be media as well. But in some way, meme has always been around. It''s part of culture. As Kevin was saying, it was a concept that came from the 70s. And in some ways, it''s no different than a brand. You think of Hello Kitty or Mickey Mouse. These are memes as well. It''s just that in the past, there''s no way for you to financially participate in that except to buy a merch. But then if you buy a merch, maybe the little figurines go up in value. But meme coin is just a very direct way for you to financially participate. So that is new. And I think the pace in which cultures are created right now with social media and all that makes this memetic moment much more possible. Whereas in the past, you just look at, you just watch NBC or CNN. For your news, everyone now go on TikTok and they create this explosive memetic moment, which now has a possibility of asset formation in the form of meme coin. What were you saying, Kevin? No, it''s like there''s a CNN and there''s Fox and there''s rock radio. There''s rock radio. But even rock radio was a meme or is a meme. Like everything starts, I feel like it starts as a meme and then you become a brand or not. And that''s when the thing dies. Like we started rock radio as a joke. It was like, oh, rock, rock radio. It''s a rock radio. You know, whatever. It was funny as fuck. It''s first. And then it became this whole serious thing and here we are. You know, I think they made it pretty big, which was interesting. But I''m just fascinated by this thing because now it''s like, do you guys think we''re pushing it too far now? Like I''ve been having this, like we''re in a weird time, right? It''s a weird time to have this panel after what just happened to this industry a few days ago. You have the president of Argentina that literally just rugged $100 million. Him, his team, whoever the hell is, like they''re all complicit. Now what? Like now what? Like at what point is it enough or is it too much? And at what point are regulators going to be involved? Like regulators are not involved anymore at all. Like they said, okay, we''re done. Like, you know, SEC is kind of like torn apart. Gensler''s out. 50 lawyers from the SEC were fired. I think the head of them was assigned to the IT department actually. True story. So at what point is it enough? Like at what point do you say, yo, like we need to be a little more careful with this? This is a challenge. Regulation''s not out. It depends on the jurisdiction. So if you come to Hong Kong, regulation is very much in vogue. Yeah. And it''s quite intense. It''s very hard to get regulated in a market like Hong Kong. What''s the byproduct? There''s no volumes here. There''s no liquidity in a market like Hong Kong on domestic exchanges. People inherently in this industry want to operate in unregulated exchanges. They want things to be as liberal and free as possible. As soon as you put too many rules around it, it creates this outflow of liquidity from an ecosystem. So this is the constant issue that Web3 and crypto has to grapple with. The more you regulate, the more flow will go to unregulated entities and institutions. How do you solve for that? At the end of it, you just got to let people manage their own wealth. I mean, sometimes I do feel protections are necessary, but there are certain individuals you would just never be able to convince not to touch certain asset classes. And then if they lose everything as a result, so be it, right? That''s why I also think you need to wait for the pendulum to swing back, right? You know, the thing is, in politics, you get the politician that you deserve. I think it''s the same here. You get the projects that you deserve in Web3. If people still want to trade meme coin with the kind of regulatory framework and with the kind of disclosure and with the fairness that is the status quo right now, then we get the coins that we deserve, right? So I think the pendulum needs to shift and it''s taking time, but I feel the moment is close. I agree, but like what kind of disclosure do you put on a meme coin, right? As a regulator? Right. This coin is not worth it. It''s more about the mechanism, right? Sure, sure, sure. There''s a mechanism, Dutch auction, right? I agree with that. I agree with that. But the actual, like the warning to a particular... No, there''s no financial... Well, I mean, part of the beauty was there''s nothing to it, right? There''s nothing to it, yeah. But that was easier, I feel, when meme coins were actually memes. And fair launches, right? Like we were talking, we started with about Dogecoin. To a certain extent, even a Trump coin felt more fair than a lot of the... Yeah, at least the rules are clear, right? I mean, they said 80% held up. 80% is locked. Right, yeah. The rest is free for all. Here''s a CA, it''s launched. But now it''s like there''s so much going on, different groups, snipers, bots. It''s just so much going on, you know. Do you guys think, Kevin, actually, do you think maybe one day like AI generated meme coins are going to overtake? Is there like an AI overlord? There was all AI mania, right, recently? Yeah, what makes you think that the memes that we have today is not already AI curated, right? I mean, I''m pretty sure like TikTok''s actually like intentionally making everyone dumber, as you said. Dumber and number about like what you actually see and what you actually slide through or like swipe through. Yeah. And, you know, it''s come to a point where like, yeah, AI is good, but like AI can make things worse for like collectively like human beings being much dumber. Is this already happening? I don''t know. I''m not the smart guys on this panel. But yeah, but like we''re still early in like in terms of like AI. What we can do, what I can actually see is like in a few years time, if we''re making fun about AI and we''re trying to make discrimination about like the AI. Like AI content should be like filter everything. It will come back and bite us. Like we will be canceled just because like we''re discriminating AI because we want the AI right in like 10, 15 years time. Yeah. Yeah. So be careful with that. So like. Yeah, don''t be AI phobic. Stop kicking the Boston Dynamics robot. Yeah. That video will come back to you. Yeah. What do you think? Do you think it''s going to be an AI takeover in this meme space? Because like in gaming, there''s a lot, right? Yeah. Yeah. Gaming and AI. Well, in our case, for instance, for our game, which is PuffGo, we currently support both user generated content and AI generated content. What we found is that while AI generated content is good at augmenting the parts that are not exactly being thought of from the user perspective, the user generated content is still more creative. So there''s still a lot of runway for AI to be able to launch tokens. And aside from that, I think what AI can impact is the actual trading, I guess. Because I mean, the AI, meme coins, whether they''re human made or AI made, they''re $0 until someone buys it at $1 and then it cascades into whatever happens with coins, I guess. But when AI comes into the picture and trades these tokens like algorithmically, automatically, that''s probably something interesting as well. Not just in the meme coins part, but also in crypto assets in general. So yeah, that''s how I see it. So in terms of the cycle, outside of just memes, because I feel like we can talk about memes all we want, but at some point, I think most people here really got a good grasp on what they are and what the good ones are and whatnot. But I''ll ask you guys at the end to give us a little tip. But where do you think we are at this stage in this cycle? After a few rugs, usually you''re like, there''s exhaustion. I think the market''s a little tired or wants something new. It feels like after last rugs, people want VC tokens again, dude. Good for you guys. But where do you think we are in this cycle? A lot of executive order has been signed just a month ago. It''s going to take 180 days, right? It''s a cycle. A lot of positive headlines, man. We had a lot of real positive news coming out that''s not just an idea or a promise. But right now, we''re in a bit of that vacuum. So for us, it''s heads down, building good projects that actually solve some problems, right? I think hopefully then we''ll be able to catch that wave when all that good news comes. So are we still early? We''re in a little bit of a vacuum right now. Yeah. You think late stage, mid stage, early stage? Come on, make a call. You''re in a mocha. You know everything. I think we''re going to be quiet. I''m not even sure we''re at the bottom right now. We''re going to be quiet for a while. Yeah. A couple of months. Sharp. Yeah. Yeah. What do you think? Well, crypto is always characterized by what I would call mini hyper cycles. Yeah. There''s no such thing as a normal macro cycle in the world of Web3. It''s crazy. Yeah. But the structural growth story, I''m very, very cognizant of the fact that the structural growth story continues to be there and will continue to come into play. There will be more users. There will be more use cases coming out. I think when it comes to meme coins, you''re now seeing at least some open mindedness to work out. Can these pivot to be payment related? Like, can we do something else with them, attach a utility function? I think it''s a waste of time. It''s not going to go anywhere in my view. But this is like the last grab at hope to say beyond just being a speculative meme, can we tie this into a real world use case? I think there''s plenty of other crypto assets out there that will achieve that in a much better fashion. So, again, these will continue to be regulated to what I would call hype cycles. And when the next hype cycle occurs, it just gets shorter and shorter and shorter and shorter. So it could be in another six months or, you know, a week. I don''t know. That''s how fast these things move. Yeah. I think there was a lot. It''s what, 40,000 per day or something like that? Yeah. Is it around those? It''s like 600,000 last month. Fuck. 600,000? I only bought 100,000 of them. I''m playing. Even I got tired of it and I love this shit. You know what I mean? It just becomes... What do you think, Kevin? I mean, you see you guys over at Gate, man. You see a lot of them come and go. Yeah. Well, I guess... Well, I want to say like 95% of meme cons shit. But there''s... 99... Only 95. Higher. Higher. Yeah. Well, no, no. The 95 is always the number I go with. It''s not about meme cons. It''s about everything, right? Yeah. We don''t need 50 different solutions for layer one. We need two or three, right? We don''t need 300 Web3 Gamings a year. We need five good games. So that''s just number that I''m going with. But go back to that, right? Yeah. And if we think the market can actually digest five to ten meme cons, do the number backwards. Like how many meme cons you should launch a year that''s actually of quality and make up that 100%. And that number definitely not like whatever 600,000 or like 4 million in the last two months. So I guess we... Like in terms of the cycles, we have to filter a lot of noise and focusing on the... Even the 95% and the 5% and the rest is not even in the percentage. They shouldn''t even be discussed. I''ll have a different... Quite different perspective on that. Well, I think... Well, ultimately meme coins are just like a part of a bigger segment of... You know, a fundraising activity, so to speak. It''s easy... It''s not really easy to raise money, but for those who manage to get their token up successfully, the next and bigger challenge would be to sustain that and build something out of a meme, I guess. So we''ve seen that happen in Dogecoin. Like it started as a... Well, to round it up quite well. Well, Dogecoin started as this meme and then just there''s a community that revolves around... That converged around that meme coin and they found uses for Dogecoin, but they had time. Right now, what we''re seeing in the... Sorry, sorry. What we''re seeing in the crypto cycle right now is that things are getting rushed too much, but the real value comes from building over time. Yeah. So it ultimately depends on what do you do with the meme coin money that you''ve raised that will determine if your meme coin is shit or if it means something. I love that. Last question for each of you. Non-financial advice, of course. Okay, everyone. Gone to your head. Hypothetical. You have to pick one meme coin. What do you buy? Let the other guys answer first. Come on. We''re launching our token in the next few months. I can''t be biased, you know. Come on, man. Give us one. What''s your favorite one? In the context of crypto, anything that has longevity, I tend to be a lot more comfortable with. So Doge, Shiba. But I''m waiting for the Frank Mueller. Yeah, one Frank token. Yeah. I see them at every conference too. They were out in Japan and everything. A Lambo coin, a Pro coin, anything. Again, it represents what the culture of this is. Around the brand, yeah. Exactly. Okay, I see. What about you, Alan? Yeah, maybe go back to the basic. Like, let''s think. Oh, D-O-G, like Doge, right? But it''s crazy, right? I was talking about a Doge dividend. Did you hear that yesterday? Right? Yeah. I don''t know. Maybe like some Dogecoin. Bitwise literally has an ETF rolling out for Dogecoin. Okay, so two Doges so far. What about you, Kevin? I feel like you''re going to have a good one for us. Listen to me, right? So, again, I''ve been a trader all my life. I need to hash my bet. So, I would create my own meme coin. It''s called Anti-Meme, which is going to be a basket of like all the short pervs on like all the memes. So, when the memes goes down, my values goes up. And if memes goes up, well, I''m still a meme coin, so I goes up. Is it getting listed on Gate soon? Yeah, I have to talk to my own listing team. Like, I don''t have a professional. I have an answer now. Oh, you have an answer now. What is it? Yeah, pretty easy. You heard it here first. Oh, yeah. I love that. Well, listen, guys, thank you very much for this panel. I thought it was very insightful and a lot of fun. So, shout out to the panelists here. Thank you for having us. Thank you. Cheers.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('e362a08f5f', 'Zerocap Announces a ''First'' Product in Australia', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' So listen, this is an exciting one. We''re talking structured products linked to digital asset indices. Ooh, they say. So Mark, you''re from ZeroCap. Give us a little bit, just before we get into actually what the product is and why this is so interesting for now. Tell us a little bit about your firm. Yeah, sure, man. Good morning. Thanks for having me. Yeah, my name is Mark Heriot. I''m the head of sales at ZeroCap in Australia. We''re a leading institutional platform for digital assets in Australia, regulated. We offer a range of services, OTC, market making. We have a custody offering. And we also have a derivatives desk, one of the biggest in Australia and actually in the region as well. So one of the most comprehensive. So do a bunch of stuff, but really excited today to be here with you guys and launching this product with Coindesk. Beautiful. So my name is Alan Campbell. I''m president of Coindesk Indices. We are in the business of developing indices and working with issuers to bring novel kind of investment products to market. And so we''re very fortunate to work with Mark on this. What is the product that we''re here to launch today? Yeah, sure. So we''re actually going to launch a series of structured products on the Coindesk Indices and more specifically the CD20. Yeah. The initial one is going to be a principle protected structure. One of the first of its kind. And, you know, it''s going to offer investors some partial principle protection, but also some upside to the performance of the CD20 index, which is like a broad based crypto index. Obviously, you guys have developed. Yeah. We think this is really exciting because as, you know, with Trumponomics and things like this, we have a lot of new entrants to the market. They''re going to want exposure to crypto, but they, you know, they might not want to bet the house. So this is like a gentle way for them to get involved and get broad based exposure whilst protecting some of their capital. Yeah. Do you guys know where the Coindesk 20 is? Not so much. Maybe. It''s the most traded digital asset index in the world. A total volume of about 13 and a half billion since we launched it a year ago. It trades mainly as a perpetual future on the bullish exchange. And it does approximately a billion dollars a month. So this is a very important and growing asset and piece of market structure for the industry. And so Mark and his team are thinking about how to bring this to life in a novel way. What does this product do? Like there''s clearly structured products, not new. What is the gap that you see? What is really the opportunity? And who are you targeting? Like who''s this for? Yeah, sure. So I think if you look at the traditional finance world, you know, equities, for example, if an investor say in Hong Kong was broad based tech exposure, they would look at like the Nasdaq or the triple Q ETF. Yeah. In crypto, we don''t really have anything like that up until now. So people would either buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, maybe they go Solana or they maybe go to the other end of the spectrum and go memes. Right. And it''s hard to get like build a basket that represents that sort of broader based exposure. So the CD20 is great at that. And what we''re now doing is using that CD20 underlying and then wrapping products around it. And the good thing about structured products, you can tailor the profiles of people''s investment outcomes. If they want something more conservative, they want some yield, they want some raciness, you know, with leverage, we can do all those kind of things. Yeah. So the great thing is the CD20 underpins it and then we can tweak the payoffs depending on what investor class we''re going after. Okay. You guys are engineers in a way. Volatility is a kind of key component of crypto. Is there any risk that we''re kind of over financializing, over engineering these products and kind of perhaps detracting from what is appealing to many people? Yeah, sure. I think historically we know crypto is quite a complex asset class and barriers to entry are quite high for like, you know, you got to run different pieces of software and things like this. Yeah. So I think historically running structured products and crypto was like difficulty squared and it''s probably not resonated that much until now. I think, however, with the introduction of the iBit, the spot ETF from BlackRock, you''re opening up this marketplace to an incumbent or legacy sector that''s never been there before. And a lot of these guys are used to these kind of products. So if we can give them something simple to fit in, shoehorn into that existing framework, I don''t think it''s over engineering. And I think over time you''re going to just see more and more of this as people get more familiar with crypto. They''re going to want to see familiar payoffs and structured products or ETFs or loans, collateralized loans, whatever it is. These are going to come to the market. So I think having a broad based index outside of Bitcoin and outside of, like they say, the tail of assets is going to be really helpful to express that. So just finally, we''re nearly at time. What how do you address a larger market? How do you cast the net even wider to beyond maybe it''s high net worth or maybe it''s family offices? Like what is the is it a catalyst? Is there going to be a moment where structured products, which these are super interesting and highly defined and structured products? How do you how do you get that bigger audience? Yeah, sure. I think Asia is a very structured dominate structure product dominated market that the volumes on derivatives outweigh spot in traditional assets by a multitude of factors. What we need is a bit more of the plumbing to come. A lot of the I speak to a lot of the private banks up here in Hong Kong. There is interest, but the frameworks and from a legal plumbing, you know, security, custody settlement, things not quite there. So I think as regulation becomes clearer and I think, you know, SFC are doing that up in Hong Kong. Yeah. SFC will do that in the US over this year. Hopefully that becomes more crystallized. Then now we''re open the pathway for these banks to get involved. And I think when the banks start getting involved, you''ll see the volumes and the demand for this stuff skyrocket. I would tend to agree with that. We''re going to call it here. If you have more interest to talk and hear more about structured products with Mark and any of the same at CoinDesk, we have a booth somewhere on this floor. Come and chat to this. Mark, thank you very much. Thanks for having me. Cheers. Thank you. Buddy.ISA Dank adesso. Hear. Goodbye.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('ee2e12f04c', 'Playing For The Future', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' I''m very excited for this panel because it is an absolutely banger lineup. We are going to be talking about the future of Web3 Gaming. The title is Playing for the Future, so we want to unpack where it''s going. I think if you go back to, say, 2021, the narrative was very clear. It was all about play to earn, it was all about scholarships, Axie was the big dominant game. But today, there isn''t really one clear single narrative. We''re going to hear from four different perspectives around what Web3 Gaming is and where it''s going. As I said, banger lineup. We''ve got Theo here representing Gunzilla Games. They launched the absolute smash hit game off the grid on Avalanche. It really broke through and gave us all in Web3 Gaming something to be very excited about. Oh, there''s a friend in the front row. We''ve got Gabby Dizon from Yield Guild Games. He''s really looking at on-chain communities. How can guilds actually lead the future for on-chain communities? We''ve got Sebastian Borget. He is a co-founder of The Sandbox, which is really looking at user-generated content, very much focused on content creators. He''s also the president of the Blockchain Game Alliance, our industry organization, which I''m lucky to sit on the board of. Gabby was a founding board member. And then we have Renz Chong, who is from Sovereign, formerly Breed-A-Dow, if you''ve heard about them. So they started out breeding Axies, but today they''re actually focused on fully on-chain games and autonomous worlds. So, what I wanted to start off with is, all of you guys are approaching this from a different perspective, right? So I''d like to go down the line and hear what is your model, what are you building, and what fundamental assumptions are you making in terms of what players want? And if you''re willing, why do you think the others are wrong in terms of why you''re tackling it? So, Theo, do you want to kick us off? Absolutely. So there''s a couple things that we look at very, very differently from traditional Web3 games. First and foremost, we make it all about the gamer. Yep. And from our perspective, what a gamer, and again, I say gamer broadly, not a Web3 gamer, not a Web2 gamer, but what a gamer wants is an entertaining experience. They don''t want to mess around with setting up wallets. They don''t want to mess around with on-off ramping fiat or swapping tokens. They don''t even want to really focus on earning money. They want entertainment. They want a good gaming experience. Okay. So we firmly believe that everything has to be about that. And then secondary to that is your asset ownership, because that''s where you can obviously do things better than current Web2 projects. You can give people the ability to own all of their own assets, trade those assets, and if they so choose, then monetize those assets by selling them on third-party marketplaces. And only after all of those things do you have the ability to create somewhat of an incentivized economy through adding a token. And to that end, what I disagree with in terms of prior Web3 projects in gaming is that we have far too many projects that are in essence gamified staking protocols. Okay. So you have some financial rewards. It''s like regular staking. You have some inflationary treasury that inflates and dilutes supply. And then you have, instead of a button that''s a stake, you have some sprites that you move across the screen. Oftentimes you''re forced to purchase, in some cases, an expensive NFT in order to be even allowed to play the game. I won''t name names, but I recently heard about a project that just kind of went bankrupt, a game that forced people to buy an NFT to join the early playtests. Like how crazy is that? Like a regular gamer would never put up with that. They''d be like, see ya. Yeah. And yeah, anyway, so that''s, you know, my position. And I really, really, truly hope that once folks see a very, very successful launch, which we have coming up very, very shortly, that they will change their opinion as well and move towards the future where a user can simply load into a game without doing any of these very onerous non-starter steps, I call them, and can simply focus on a good gaming experience where blockchain technology kind of moves into the background to enhance the gaming experience, but not to replace the gaming experience. Noted. Gabby, what''s your model and what does it say about your assumptions of your community? We bring gamer communities online and on-chain. This is something that we''ve been doing since 2020. Last year, we introduced on-chain guilds as a way for guilds to have their common registry, multi-sig wallet, and a way to have their own on-chain presence and identity. So I think that''s a very important step because for these guilds that have been playing together for a long time, we wanted to build not just their identity but collective ownership of assets. So think about it as your World of Warcraft guild put on-chain. These are permanent communities that are building ownership of their own assets, collecting it in different games, collecting their reputation as well. So yeah, that''s what we''ve been focused on. And there''s just recently been more focus in putting these elements on-chain, not just individually but as a group as well. Excellent. Thank you. Seb? So our mission is to empower anyone to become a creator. We started the Sandbox originally as a mobile game. We grew it into a large success that had 14 million downloads, 17 million pyramid creation. And we rebuilt it in 2018 using blockchain and NFT at the core to allow the creator to own their digital creation, play with them, and monetize them. Today, Sandbox continues to ship major product updates for the creation tool, no code, allowing people to make fun experiences, fun games. And we doubled down our efforts to improve the kind of game that people can make. We also bring major brands and celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Walking Dead, Barry Silton, Ubisoft, recently Attack on Titan. And this year, again, we doubled down on what we already best at to bring, again, massive franchise, either Hollywood style or like Asia style. And they will bring their fun. They will allow them to discover gameplay, discover web free many times for the first time. We are giving tokens to users after they complete the first time user experience, the tutorial or some quests, onboarding them to web free through rewards and meaningful gameplay and action. And after that, we allow them to create new games using their favorite content and favorite brands, like matching creators and brands. That''s exciting. That''s what we are going to do. Last year, we had our season four that brought more than 580,000 unique players. We''ve grown to 6.3 million users with a wallet in total. This year, we''ll launch three new seasons, at least probably four, that continue to build up on the success. Great mechanics, fun, battle pass and live ops, key gaming mechanics behind. And I think we''ll drive even more audience to web free through that. The other thing that we''re expanding upon is our vision to decentralization. We introduced the DAO last year. We had over 17 proposals voted upon by the community, over 50 discussed in the forum. The governance is in place. We support great initiatives and strategies from the communities. And now, we''re also expanding something that I think went a bit unnoticed, is how we''re expanding the vision of Sandbox to become more than the virtual world and the platform think about with this user-generated content no-code game maker. We want to enable anyone to make games with traditional game engine, Unity, Unreal, HTML5, push them on traditional stores, not necessarily have like the web free wallet requirements, traditional free to play monetization. But if you have a wallet or if you make a first purchase with a wallet, you connect your Sandbox account and then you can access all your digital assets, whether your LAN, your avatar or your SAN. Basically, we''re not waiting for others to build and showcase what interoperability in the metaverse can be. We''re bringing it ourselves. We''ll be shipping free games this year. And I think in the second half of this year, we''ll announce some quite important things as well to allow even more decentralization and empowering of creators for that. Nice. All right, Renz, you''re last. I just wanted to say, when you introduce yourself, if you could give just a little brief introduction to what fully on-chain games and autonomous worlds actually are. Just in case anyone isn''t familiar with it yet. Okay. Yeah, Renz, Sovron. So, I would say what we''re trying to do is centered around autonomous worlds or fully on-chain games as well. By definition, or at least internal definition, we want it to be defined as fully permissionless and composable worlds where both humans and actually agents are able to interact in ever-evolving worlds. Or games, right? What does that really look like? So, we believe that the biggest driver of the blockchain technology inside games would be bringing things on-chain. And it doesn''t need to be everything immediately on-chain, right? But specific components or specific systems be placed on-chain. Why is that? When we started with blockchain gaming, we started with bringing assets on-chain, right? And that allowed for people to have ownership, that allowed for people to be able to trade these assets and potentially earn from them, right? We thought about the same when we tokenized these assets, essentially like soft currency on-chain, right? Which is not soft currency anymore, but yeah. So, when we thought about it, okay, maybe there is actually merit into bringing a lot more of these things on-chain. Like maybe starting with AI systems or game systems, right? Like if you have RNG systems that can be placed on-chain, that can be verified, right? That might be beneficial to specific use cases, right? So, it''s not that every single thing for every single game needs to be on-chain. It''s that depending on what you need, modularly, right? Like we are able to take that on-chain and you have the option to actually be able to bring that on-chain. And so, ultimately, that is also our belief, right? Like we want to be able to bridge off-chain to on-chain depending on the need and the want of whoever''s creating it, and the need and the want of whoever''s using it, whether that may be like a human or an agent. Excellent. Thank you. All right. We''ve got a lot to explore in this discussion, but now you''ve got a bit of an overview on who everyone is. A couple of housekeeping things. Toward the end of this panel, we are actually going to open up to audience questions. So, if you have something that you would like to ask the panel, get ready, and we will have a runner with a microphone coming around to allow you to stand up and ask your question. But secondly, there''s a lot to unpack here. So, I would actually like to encourage you guys to debate. So, if you hear something that one of the other speakers says that you want to shut down, please do so. Good thing you invited Theo then. Right, right. So, let''s start with you actually, Theo. I want to tackle perhaps the most obvious question first. Something that I know that you feel quite passionate about. I think there are some players of off the grid who would love to see a token in the game. And I think you have a stance on that. Could you share it with us, what that is and why? Well, so I wouldn''t say that there''s off the grid players that want to see a token in the game. I would say that there''s a faction within Web3 Gaming that firmly believes that in order for you to be a true crypto game, that you must have a token, that you must be doing airdrops, that you must be, in essence, pay people to play your game. And that is what I''m absolutely categorically against. Why? I do not believe that bribing a person by paying them to play a game provides for good experience, right, in general. If your game is good enough and entertaining enough, people will come and play the game because they want to play a game. Gamers don''t look at their gaming time as a source of income. Like in some countries, of course, right, you know, even like as Axie had shown, and that was obviously a very historic moment where people could, you know, replace a year''s worth of income playing, you know, Axie for a month. Until, of course, the economy broke down because there was an inflationary treasury and it just long-term wasn''t sustainable. But the notion that gaming should be a source of income, in my opinion, is very misplaced and very misguided. I want to stop you there. Sure, of course. Who would like to reply? Okay, all right. So I don''t like being black and white, extreme position. I think there''s like something in the middle. If you did, of course, great game, fantastic gameplay, graphic, everything, you have all the key ingredients, you will attract the perfect target niche players that like this kind of game. But how do you onboard new people to discover beyond that core agent and the word of mouth that they can bring? Crypto, tokens, NFT, it brings various incentive and network effects. The fact that you can offer a reward, I didn''t say airdrop, I said offer a reward that requires action and claim, I think it can be a good incentive to attract new users and new agencies to discover your game while they would not naturally be inclined to play it. And I think it''s a good amount of reward for participation. It provides a dopamine effect that we see traditionally in free to play game where like as soon as you click on a button, there''s like a lot of virtual currency coming up on the screen. And in a way, like it''s also a better way to distribute the money that you would otherwise spend into the traditional ad network and all the web to economical space of like advertising, user acquisition, etc. So, if you''re looking at the market, the value goes directly to the players, which then can decide, do they keep the currency or the token or the NFT, do they sell it to trade it to other games, creating a virtual value into the broader ecosystem of Web3, or do they actually spend it in your game? And what we see at Sandbox is a user actually spend the token that we give them, more than 80% of them spend it back into the economy of the game, supporting the creator economy, supporting buying an avatar and so on. So, I think it''s like overall, there''s good positive aspect to it. But of course, it''s more about a question of balancing, finding the right amount to give so it''s not too little, not too much. And you have to try it. Yeah, so I''m not necessarily saying that there is not a use case for it, right? There might be games where that makes perfect sense and the economy is based on a token and it all kind of is integrated. What I''m saying is that there are some games, and I believe that off the grid firmly falls into that category, where you can''t make it about that, right? You still have incentivizations. For example, our early Pioneer skin, that was our first ever Battle Pass content pack that dropped during our Pioneer program, did 100x. So what used to cost, you know, 400 Testnet tokens now costs 40,000 Testnet tokens. So people still have the ability to kind of speculate on rarities and have somewhat of an incentivization to continue kind of progressing, accumulating in-game items, etc. But those are items that are useful in the game. Those are items that you can only extract from within the game or purchase it from another person that listed on the peer-to-peer marketplace that extracted it from the game. There is a direct correlation between the item and its utilization in the game. A token breaks that chain, right? A token can then be used by any of these other, you know, let''s say 10 million was reported last summer by Dapp, right? Or 10 million daily active wallets that almost like a cloud of locusts just descend onto an ecosystem, extract however much value they can, and then descend onto the next ecosystem. So you''re against the external liquidity that comes in that doesn''t care about the game. Exactly. Precise. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The utility is super important, specifically for the game. But let me ask the audience, like, how many of you are familiar about Sandbox? All right. Oh, wow! Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. That''s a good show of hands. How many of you have Sand token? How many of you have played Sandbox? Oh, wow. That''s a good audience, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But usually, like, the ratio of, like, knowing Sandbox and having Sand as a token contributes a lot to our brand awareness, and generally of people understanding what we do, supporting it, growing our network, without being actual players or creators. So it''s a right balance of different audiences that are contributing, I think, all in valuable ways, as players, as community, as ambassadors, and so on, that you find in Web3. And I still believe, like, it''s better to spend it within the Web3 ecosystem and directly to the users than to the big corporate companies that sell your data. Wait, wait, wait. So I''m keen to hear what Gabby thinks about this, because we''ve talked about it very much in terms of, like, games and platforms. But how do you think about it from, like, a community or, say, a guild perspective? So, for us, we organize the guilds, and we want these guilds to come in and contribute to the game communities that they''re part of, and get to own assets in the long term. Of course, there''s play to airdrop campaigns. Of course, people want to make money, right? But I think we really want to encourage people really coming in and then contributing to these communities, and then being able to earn from that. What do you mean by that, contributing? Because I know you''ve talked before about, like, the difference between community contributions versus, like, DeFi that is just perhaps extractors. So a lot of the roles we have in our community, of course, there are people who are players, right? But a lot of the people who are actually earning are content creators, they''re UGC, we have our YGG Esports team, who also creates a lot of content. And, for example, with our partnership with games like Parallel, we''ve done a lot of work to not only bring highly skilled players, create content around that, create visibility around it, and even create fandom around the game, right? And it''s that, and then we also happen to own assets in the game. So there''s really a real sense of contribution, and I''d like to think that''s what we want to do for games like Off The Grid as well. And Renz, like, from a fully on-chain perspective, like, do you think this is going to change? Like, if you''re, say, deploying an autonomous world and it becomes completely controlled by the DAO or the community, are you thinking about, like, token issuance in a completely different way? Or it''s the same? I don''t know. Right. Well, for us, we actually took inspiration from Second Life, right? Where, okay, a game may not be, you know, just like a game on its own, right? What if, like, a game eventually transformed into a world quite similar to this one, right? Except exists virtually. And then, like, jobs, all of these other jobs can exist, like, natively within, like, that world, right? Well, the Linden dollar was mainly a medium of exchange, though, right? Which is quite different to the way that people are thinking about tokens which are speculative. Right. So, I mean, what would happen then if, like, you are able to bridge, like, the off-chain from the on-chain world, right? And, you know, that''s why we were exploring, for example, like, a layer two on top of Fiverr Liquid because on-chain finance is supposedly there, right? And if on-chain liquidity is already there, if we are allowed to, you know, bridge this liquidity outside of the games into the games, right, and seamlessly allow that to flow, similar to, you know, for example, like, stock markets, right? Yeah. Like, then are we able to create that environment which allows these now digital worlds to seamlessly flow back into physical worlds and vice versa? And would that then be, or would we be forced to delineate between both worlds or discriminate against, like, one another, right? So those are the perspectives that we''re actually looking into as we actually journey through this on-chain environment. Yeah, I do think that virtual worlds have different goals than just games, per se. And they might look like the same thing but have slightly different goals. Of course, the problem of virtual worlds is that if they''re not fun, then they don''t get players in the first place. But I can see a world where there''s a lot more commerce transactions happening. There''s a lot more, like, virtual labor happening in a virtual world which may not necessarily be trying to be a game, right? I think there''s one very, very important component that most Web3 projects don''t take into account when discussing incentivizations and token economies. So within the very, very isolated Web3 kind of economy and Web3 community, I do agree with you that it is a very, very novel and interesting way to bootstrap an economy, to bootstrap an audience, to bootstrap a community. However, we currently, like I said, per DapRator''s report, hit an all-time high of active daily wallets of 10 million last summer. That was a 70% increase from Q1 2024 that DapRator attributed simply to just farming and airdrops and labeled as unsustainable. So what you have then is you have hundreds of thousands of projects, way more than we had in 2021, right? We have hundreds of thousands of projects selling and pitching and dumping tokens on the same roughly maybe 5, 6, 7 million at most daily active wallets. There''s a problem there. This is not sustainable. So the only way to make it sustainable is to bring in regular gamers. And a regular gamer, as soon as you start saying the first three sentences about incentivization, token, blah, blah, blah, like, phew, right? You lost them. Not to mention that prior to off-the-grid launching last October in early access, any time you would mention NFT or token in the context of a game, you''d get a hundred comments saying, scam, scam, scam, I will never touch this. That''s a narrative that we were able to change now with off-the-grid. Now, people are saying, well, like famous streamers would say, oh, why spend millions of dollars building a Steam marketplace when you can simply use blockchain technology? Or they''re like, oh, NFT''s not that bad. It''s like serialized Pokemon cards, very fireable and trackable on-chain. So we started changing the narrative. But the only reason we started changing the narrative and attracting regular folks to Web3 is because we do not lead with, oh, you''re going to get rich and you''re going to get tokens and you''re going to be incentivized and you''re going to be an evangelist, da-da-da, all that usual stuff, right? So you''re right. It is not black and white. And there is a use case for that. But any project that wants to get to 10 million daily active users and not a couple hundred thousand daily active users needs to embrace the mainstream. And the mainstream will absolutely not want to have any part of any of these things. That''s the problem. That''s why we need to strike a balance and make this approachable to folks and make this easy to use, make the blockchain and the earning component kind of move into the background. Having said that, I do fully agree that tokens allow you to share, quote unquote, the wealth with your community instead of it being this corporate black box, which is the old way of doing business, that there is a path forward where you do that in a very, very nice way. But I just simply think that the current models that Web3 has explored are not it. They''re it for the very, very small, very techie community, but they''re not it for bringing the next 100 million people to Web3. I have a question for you, Theo. Do you segregate between the potential millions of users of off the grid versus the people who will be interacting with the Web3 components, the people who will be looking at the NFTs and the token in your ecosystem? Great point. To some degree, there is a natural separation, but there''s also, of course, a lot of crossover. A regular gamer, for example, will more likely than not never interact with our 10,000 validator nodes that mint all the in-game items. So for those that don''t know, we have our game, we have our blockchain, and then we have 10,000 kind of distributed, decentralized nodes that mint every single in-game item. And the gamer pays those validator nodes directly for the process of minting the in-game item. That''s where we see a lot of, of course, Web3 interaction, a lot of excitement, and people interacting directly with launching components, tokens, NFT nodes, et cetera. On the gaming side, absolutely not. Like, we have traditional gamers that in the chat when people in our disco chat, when people bring up tokens, they''re like, I don''t care. Like, I don''t care about any of that stuff. I''m playing this game because it''s better than Call of Duty. And that''s really the reaction we want. Go ahead. It''s all music to my ears. Actually, we don''t see something different. Like, at the Blockchain Game Alliance, we try to showcase actual good games that are fun and bring players with all the things abstracted, hidden, and so on behind. The benefit comes later. One thing I want to say about, like, the topic playing for the future, like, any game that want to prepare itself for the future has to think of itself, like, how do I evolve from being a single game into being a full platform? One of the ways is user-generated content. Players being able to contribute with their own character, their own level, their own modes, et cetera, will evolve those games from... And will turn them into, like, digital nations, I would say. And that those that can live for a decade or even more, they will have, like, contribution, they will have differentiated gameplay, and at some point, they will have a form of economy that ideally should not be centralized and controlled only by the developer of the platform. And hopefully, Blockchain and Web3 is a good solution for that. But it''s a step-by-step process. I think if we look this year, what game can fit that, GTA 6 is on track to become that next big game turning to a huge platform. But we''ve seen platforms like Overwolf. They paid $240 million this year, about 2024, to creators who contributed modding games like Sims, like GTA 5, and so on. And we''ve seen the Minecraft economy and everything it had enabled because it allowed the players to actually run their own servers, make their own rules, change the gameplay, the core gameplay. I think we need that, and Web3 supports that in many aspects. Okay. I''ve got a quick question for Renz, which is following on from what we''ve just been talking about. And after that, we''re going to open up to the audience. So if you do have a question, please put up your hand. We''ve got a runner who will come around with a microphone so that you can ask the panel a question. But just following on from what we were chatting about here, Renz, I feel like you''re in between a rock and a hard place because one of the biggest criticisms about fully on-chain games is that they''re clunky, slow, very hard to play, very technical, because you are really leaning into that decentralised aspect. Now, it''s no secret that I love that because I think that''s where we''re going to see real innovation, you know, answer the question of why we''re putting Web3 in games at all. And what can blockchain do that we''ve never seen before in games? But your DAU is like basically zero. So like, how are you thinking about that? You know, where do you think this is going to go this year? Right. We''re actually quite like deep into the tech. For example, like Lattice just recently developed this quarry, right, which allows for real-time gaming. So we''ve actually tested out during DEFCON that you''re able to do like a first-person shooter without having to like click every single button every single time you actually try to fire. Wow. So, well, I''m not shilling it. I mean, like, I think the tech is improving, right? Like, for sure, I would say it''s less about like, hey, it''s about like the on-chain-ness, but it''s really more about like the UI, right? Like what kind of like user experience do we actually want to go? Like we can eventually design, or at least I believe, right, like we can eventually design like a fully on-chain game where a lot of these logic, a lot of these states are on-chain without having to go through like the barriers or the blockers that are currently hindering us from being able to do so, right? And if we were to compare like the current state, yeah, sure, like your DEU is going to go to zero, right? But that''s why we''re not like, I mean, that''s why we''re also not there yet, right? Because we know what to do. We know what infrastructure to build. But we don''t have the right technology or we don''t have the right, I would say like process that we did in the past as well to be able to achieve that right now. So I''d say like we already have like a lot of the foundation set up for us. It''s just a matter of like really pushing through it. And again, it may not be the future, right? Or it may not be the future for everyone, but it is an alternative, right? And for us, when we were thinking about like the gaming industry, and it''s not just Web3 that''s actually losing faith in terms of like gaming as a whole, right? Like we see a lot of layoffs in terms of like the gaming sector, right? And so like we also know that, for example, one out of 12 Steam games have been doing like 200,000 in revenue, which is not even enough to cover their game costs, right? So there''s clearly a problem here, right? And what we''re trying to tackle here is that potentially if these permissionless composable worlds allow for these builders to contribute and co-build and co-create, right? There might be a path where we don''t have to reskin, recreate like, you know, games and push forward for innovation and development much faster and much cheaper, right? With the technology that we have at hand. So yeah. Yeah. Autonomous worlds now remind me of where NFTs were. 2017, 2018, Seth and I were here in Hong Kong trying to raise money for NFT projects. It was incredibly early. Nobody really understood it. And then maybe 2021, people started getting it and it started to matter. I think there''s a lot of innovation in autonomous worlds. It''s probably not ready for prime time yet, but I''m glad that innovation is happening. Sovereign''s reading the way because there will be a day wherein we''re going to see a lot of real cool things happening and we''ll see a lot of players come in there. We just don''t know when that moment will be, right? For NFTs, it took a few years and there were people who really believed in it, who were experimenting in it way before the money, the liquidity, VC interest came in. Yeah. And yeah, we remember those days really well, right? I do. I was about to point like the importance of experimentation. Yes. Like you''re literally playing with mechanics that will set some portion of new genre of games, new experiences that we haven''t seen yet. And that maybe that particular will not succeed. I don''t wish that for you, but it will be an important step to what like the next big success from the takeaways we''ll take. And right now I see two major innovation on chain gaming and AI agenting gaming, not just trying to change the existing rules of gameplay, but really, really inventing new games that we haven''t tried. And well, maybe not all of the game will be successful. Maybe some will be so weird, so like freaky, but after the fifties try, one of them will emerge, will become the category leader. And we hope that it will pave the way for like the growth of the industry sector again. Yeah, it''s such an important space to watch and keep an eye on. All right, we only have about six minutes left. We have a question down the front here. We have a microphone down the front. So please tell us your name and your company and your question. Sure. Hi, my name is Alex. I lead gaming at Layer Zero. This is all music to my ears because I think I work with almost all of you. And I guess one question for all of you, if you could mention any specific milestone or maybe a set of events that will make Web3 Gaming as a category great again. One might say, was it ever great? But I''m just curious when you foresee the gaming sector, Web3 Gaming sector sort of blow up and explode in terms of the on-chain growth, in terms of the token performance, in terms of the actual play time and the play data. When do you foresee that happening in the mainstream adaption and why? It''s time for you to rattle off some stats. There we go. So yeah, so let''s start with the fact that since last October when we launched Early Access, we''ve amassed over 13 million wallets, over 280 million transactions, averaging 2.5 million transactions per day, and an average of 400 to 500,000 daily active users. And that''s just Early Access and we''re just getting started. So in my opinion, there''s several key moments that need to take place in order for mass adoption to happen. Number one, a project like Off The Grid hitting 100 million gamers will hit the radar of every single major gaming studio out there that then is going to start thinking, hold on a second, like maybe there''s something there. And then users are going to start driving adoption by saying, hey, we will simply not play games where we can''t own our own assets. We will have then major studios saying, oh, we were always talking about asset ownership and start embracing NFT technology and blockchain technology. So I think that''s one very, very important part. And on the other side of the Web3 fence, you will see projects saying, wow, this really worked. Like Off The Grid is onboarding tens and tens of millions of gamers. Let us also focus on this different way of building in Web3 and then onboarding massive amounts of game. I think those are the two main kind of trigger points that will make mainstream adoption happen. Well, I think like gaming is really broad in the categories of games. So like you see here, like Godzilla success and it''s fantastic. It''s appealing to a lot of AAA and bigger game studio. At the same time, like we''ve seen like it only needs one game on one particular platform or chain to succeed to drive a whole industry. It happened with X-Infinity. It happened with Telegram games. Like no matter how people might like or dislike Amster Combat, it led to a growth of a big sector and brought hundreds of millions of users to play games on these devices and enjoy transacting, etc. And those games, because we''ve seen it before in the industry of the gaming industry, specifically with mobile gaming. They seem a stupid game, either clicker, casual or hyper casual. Very soon, like the industry will professionalize, mid-core game will appear, we''ll have meta gameplay, we''ll have better graphics, and all of that will come. And actually, it''s already coming at a, I would say, 10 times faster than what we saw before in the mobile gaming industry. So by this year or next year, we''ll have great Telegram game with much better retention loop monetization. And the access to the distribution network that Telegram represents has been a massive catalyst for that. And I think like we''re going to continue seeing innovation with virtuals and everything of AI agent protocol as well that can accelerate gaming and adoption as well. So, yeah. Gabby Renz, did you want to add to that? Or should we take another question from the audience? We can take another question. Any more questions? Yes. Sir, over here has a question. Please tell us your name and your company and your question. Yeah, hi, I''m Anthony from Talent. I know nothing about the Web3 space, so I''m just here trying to learn. So maybe I''m one of those mainstream gaming people. Welcome. Do you see any roadblocks in the regulatory space around NFT? And just while you were talking, I just had an idea, like if your game is linked to NFT or NFT or blockchain ownership, what happens if the ownership changes mid-game? How do you deal with that? Yes, I''ll jump in. There''s two different things here. Number one, on the regulatory side, I believe we are getting to a point where more and more common sense regulation is happening across the board all over the world. And so, obviously, my personal recommendation is for games to get familiar with what regulation is and comply with those regulations. It''s going to make it a lot easier for the whole industry. But your second point in regards to, I believe you said, if ownership changes of the company, what happens to those assets? Well, obviously, if a project decides to completely just shut down, then you have pretty pictures and you do with them what you will. But provided that that does not happen, right, you have assets that you can trade before, you know, you, let''s say, leave a project or a game. In my case, my personal experience was I have two boys. They played a bunch of Fortnite. They spent a couple thousand dollars of their own hard earned cash on in-game items. And then when they inevitably moved on to a different game, they were like, hey, Dad, how do I get my money back? And I''m like, you don''t. They''re like, what do you mean? I mean, I think, for kids these days, it''s totally normal to own digital assets, but they were flabbergasted that they couldn''t actually sell these items. So that''s the more normal traditional use case, right? You move on to a different game or you have three of a specific object that you extracted from the game. You sell two, you keep one, you buy something else. That type of interaction is really what the NFT use case is most applicable for currently. I agree on the second part, 100%. On the first part, I tend to disagree. I think, like, even though it''s important to provide, like, safety for users, gaming is first and foremost a sector of fun and entertainment. And imposing regulation to what the first dollar spent by a user on an NFT is like buzz killer. Like, nobody wants to do a KYC and verification as soon as you spend your first dollar to an in-app purchase. And certain countries are taking this too seriously, imposing age verification, user spending caps, controlling how much they spend and how much they can earn with every NFT. That''s what happened in Japan. That''s what is bound to happen in France. This will put those countries lagging behind under adoption of the technology and allowing the players of their country to learn what''s like decentralization, web-free and like decentralized finance can be skilled through gaming versus others that are more broadly thinking and open about that. Oh, I agree with you. But I just don''t want these projects to get sued into the ground because they didn''t comply with regulations. Well, I''m fine to contribute and give my opinion about that. And represent the BGA as well to support our industry on that topic. Guys, we''re out of time, sadly. But I just want to thank you so much for this fantastic conversation. I think what we''ve learned is that you''re not actually all completely at odds with each other. I think decentralization exists on a spectrum and there''s many different ways to tackle it. And what that shows us is how the web 3 gaming industry is evolving. There really is something for everyone and so many different ways to tackle it and make it real to you. So thank you guys for sharing your insights. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks everybody for coming. Thank you. Thanks everybody for coming.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.192', NULL, NULL, '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');
INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('empowering_global_food_chain_through_technology', 'Empowering Global Food Chain Through Technology', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Music Morning everybody. I guess as we get started I just want to paint a picture. We work in the agriculture and food world. And over the last four years we''ve been building an agricultural and food platform. It''s web 3 and mobile. And we have about 2 million users of our platform around the world. And are growing very quickly. The thing I want you to think about is the agricultural space lags from a technology perspective. Right now there''s about 570 million farmers in the world producing a lot of the world''s produce. We''re connected to them in 35 projects around the world right now. And we''re adding projects every month. You know just to paint a picture of this world. The user is detached from technology. They have difficulty accessing financing. They have difficulty working with various regulations. And our platform helps manage all of that for them. So we typically work with cooperatives and big huge food companies to bring this technology to small farmers in Africa and Asia and South America and Americas and Europe. And it''s pretty exciting. So today a couple of my team members are here with me. You see our pictures up on the board. So we don''t need to introduce ourselves. Andreas is going to moderate. And we''re just going to talk about this and give you some time to ask questions after. Thank you, John. And thank you guys for showing up today. So to summarize this, what we''re talking about here is reaching 570 million farmers globally that are not even in Web 1.0. And we''re talking about automating services to take them from not being online to Web 3.0 services that you all think about and work on. So that''s what we''re going to talk about here. Thank you for coming. And we''re kicking it off to give you an example on how we scale this. What is the technology we use on the ground to scale that impact? And Carlotta, our director for ESG, she''s creating our product on an ESG platform for Dimitra. And she can tell us a little bit about that. Tell us. Thank you very much, Andreas. Nice seeing you all here. Well, ESG stands for Environment, Social, and Governance, as some of you might know. But it''s really all about sustainability. So what we want to do at Dimitra is indeed leveraging cutting-edge technology, such as artificial intelligence or blockchain technology, to really enable a successful, sustainable, and also very accessible solution for farmers globally to onboard and to actually access more benefits from the market. So we have different real-world impact projects. Like John mentioned, we have a global presence. And for instance, we just launched a project with Brazil, the biggest association of fruits, whereby we are helping them to actually bridge the gap between what they''re already doing successfully in terms of sustainability, from water management to well-being in the workforce to good governance, to actually being able to show that transparently and with accountability onto the blockchain. And that''s just one example. But we can talk about many others. So in that project, we''re turning data points that they''re already working on on their farm, in their production of food, into a protocol that we can then do statistics on for them and for their group to improve their ESG levels. So, John, we have a wheel up here of all that great technology that you and your team are envisioning for the future and that you''ve already implemented in some of these real-world projects on a large scale. I mean, we''re already talking to 2.5 million users today. And we''re scaling up to about 100 million in the next two years. So here we are. Tell us about that technology and what''s the biggest impact that you see that needs to happen now on the ground. Well, I think there''s a lot of technology that we''ve got up here. These are applications. These are components of our applications. And most of those have already been built and have been beta tested or actually live. AI this year is one of our biggest impacts. And we''re building three AI protocols this year. You know, I''ll give you an example of one of those. We have a group of 150,000 farms run by or invested in by a bank in Brazil. And this bank needs data on the performance of those farms. So we have a yield estimation process that we''ve developed with a little bit of input from the farmer satellite and some other statistical information that we analyze that an individual can go in, you know, with a token, buy, or a bank can buy a report every month that comes out on the farm, on the performance, and the prediction of the output of that farm. So great tool for investors, great tool for lenders, great opportunity to set up various lending pools and Web3 crypto pools that we can empower with these predictive tools. And we''ve got those first 150,000 farms set up for that right now. So we''re building this protocol to automate that. And it''s already been built and tested. We''ve just got to get through the protocol final testing. So we''re talking about automating small-scale financing for the farmer. And they might be looking for $100, $200, $500 that they need to advance them to the next harvest. So automating those processes that are too costly for the old-world banking system, that''s where we''re interested in looking at new technologies and new partners to automate that process for the farmer that''s not yet digitized. And what''s then the next step to making a real-world impact for the farmer, monetizing other things that they do? Yeah, I mean, carbon credits is one that''s great. And Carlotta''s got a lot of involvement in our carbon credit program. Most farms in the world can''t access a carbon credit program, although they do very carbon-positive activities on their farm, like planting trees. An individual farm can''t offset the cost of applying for carbon credits based on what they might earn from a carbon credit perspective. You know, your typical one-acre or one-hectare farm might earn $40 in carbon credits per year. We''ve got a project in Ethiopia right now where we''ve got a contract with a group of cooperatives, 1.2 million farms, and we can offset all of that cost, digitize that on a 10-year contract. So each one of those farmers, if they plant 30 trees depending on the species of tree, may earn a carbon credit. And they get that every year for 20 years as long as they''re part of the program. So, you know, that carbon credit today is worth around $20. If you plant hundreds of trees, you know, they can make even hundreds of dollars. And that''s a supplement to their farm income. And that''s a big supplement. If you consider that their profit currently starts at about $600 a year for a coffee farmer, that''s how much they''re making in profit a year. So the impact of $40 to $100 a year, free money, is huge for that community. And that''s what we''re automating here. And if I may add something to that as well. Please do. I think the Dimitra AI is also very interesting when it comes to truly empowering smallholder farmers with insights based on data-driven takeaways, basically. So what we''re trying to do, for instance, in Kenya, we had a project that is called One Million Avocados, whereby, via our app, we actually help farmers to identify what is the best suitability in terms of land and water resources and how to plant the avocado trees and where specifically so that they could actually increase their yield longer term. So this is, again, an example of how high-tech or cutting-edge technology can really be used on a day-to-day basis for farmers. So to translate it for my 10-year-old niece, maybe, so you have farmers that don''t have the money to plant new avocado trees because it takes two years to produce avocados. So they don''t invest $100 into that tree. We do what, John? What do we do? Well, I mean, we went out and bought 10,000 trees and we gave them to farmers as an investment. And that''s one of the things we do at Dimitra. We went out and planted those trees with them. And we take a 20% yield from the tree. The farmer gets the tree, which they typically would never plant, and just because of the duration of the investment. And we earn an ongoing investment. And investors in us earn an ongoing investment in those trees. So we created NFTs around each tree that we invested in, but that we have on our marketplace to also have other investors invest in, correct? Yeah. We have a similar project in Brazil. So one of the state governments of Brazil, Araima Brazil, wants to grow their cocoa production. So working with that state government, working with a government agency on fruit, working with a government agency on small business, we have a program where we are looking to plant maybe 300,000 cocoa trees over the next few years in Brazil. So the investors would invest in that and earn a yield back based on the cocoa production. And if you guys know, cocoa last year went through the roof in price, right? Our chocolate bars are going up in price. It''s a problem for me. But as we go through this, people have an opportunity to invest in cocoa. Cocoa outperformed from a total price perspective Bitcoin last year. And saw about a 9x in one year in price. It''s very lucrative to plant cocoa now. And there''s a lot of problems. And we have technology, you know, and Carlotta alluded to our AI. We have AI to help farmers combat and have early warning systems for cocoa black pod disease, which is one of the reasons we''re having these problems for climate change. I mean, there''s lots of reasons. And you may want to touch more on some of the AI stuff. Yeah, yeah. No, that''s very interesting, actually. In terms of predictive analysis, AI can really combat a lot of different climate change issues that can be mitigated by farmers who actually do not have previous knowledge on it. Because we do not expect farmers in developing countries to have a very high education. But via our app, via knowledge sharing, in a very easily accessible way via the app, farmers all of a sudden can access these kind of insights and can actually do something about mitigating climate change, for instance. But also, AI can help them to detect diseases. So we had another project with citrus diseases in Brazil, whereby by taking a picture, a farmer could actually detect ahead of time what kind of trees had to cut down in order to not let the pest spread in the farms. And I think all of these more data-driven insights are all of a sudden accessible and democratized, if you want to use this world nowadays, to smallholder farmers. And that''s really our mission. So this is the essence of what we do. We take complex technology and complex knowledge and automate it through technology to transfer it to a farmer that we are taking by the hand onto a digital journey that they''re not on yet. So to the community, it''s always interesting to talk to, what are the partners you''re looking for, John, at an event like this? Who are the interesting partners that you might bring in to collaborate on a project basis? Well, I think, you know, we''re always looking at technology partners. Who brings another comparable technology or something that''s going to support our mission? And that can be on the financing side. We look at individual financing on individual projects. One of the partners we have is the United Nations. They have hired us and are using our application in South America. They just gave us another project that there will be some announcements on shortly. And then they''re currently expanding the initial software that we provided them. So we''ve got three contracts with the United Nations in the last year. You know, we''re looking at how do you finance individual projects? Ethiopia, for example, we''re doing this carbon project for 1.2 million farms. It costs us about $11 in order to onboard a farm. And then that project will yield somewhere in the $40 to $50 million a year range for 10 years, as long as those farmers are participating. And there''s no reason for them not to participate because it supplements their income. So that means, just as an example for those of you that are in this space, we''re looking for a project partner for that project in Ethiopia to provide a liquidity pool of 10 to 15 million to kick off that onboarding of these 1.2 million farmers for a project that will yield 40 to 50 million in revenue each year over 10 years. That''s what we''re talking about. Yeah, and we''ve already kicked it off because we''ve made a personal investment. We''ve hired teams at three of the cooperatives in Ethiopia, and they''re out gathering the data already at some of those farms. So we''re targeting right now this month to have about 10,000 farms registered and signed up for the program. Although they''ve already signed the contract, we have to visit the farm and we have to get a geofence of the farm. And then we have auditors, and we have to meet certain audit requirements to get those carbon credits over time. So there''s an annual audit requirement. But the project is going. And the cool thing about that project is it piggybacks onto all this other software. So Andreas was recently promoted. He''s our head of sales globally, and he ran our European division. And one of our products up here is for compliance. And we have an EUDR project. And EUDR is a deforestation regulation that every farm in the world that sells seven different products, coffee, cocoa, or some of them soybean, needs to comply with if they''re going to ship their products to Europe. And so we enable that. And not only do we enable it to the farmer, we enable it to the coffee company. So Andreas and his team have gone out and signed up a number of large coffee traders, coffee farming organizations, roasters. And each one of those organizations sign up with us and give us thousands and thousands of farms to do the analysis. This year we''re building a protocol for that. So we enabled it in a Web 2 method. Now the AI is working. So now we''re enabling it through a protocol. And they''ll be able to issue a geofence or a grouping of geofences and receive a report back and say, here''s your 3,600 farms on your report. 200 of them are not compliant. And here''s their compliance issues. And how much value does that create for your coffee customer or your cocoa customer? Well, it creates the value that we also take them by the hand from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0 by automating those services of data analysis. So we''re talking about, in summary, they need to provide traceability to the farm level. They need to define a geofence around the farm. And we analyze that geofence if there was deforestation done since 2020. And the companies in Europe, the big roasters and traders, are incapable of understanding that that requires investment into the farming community to get that data. And that''s what we''re bridging, that gap of understanding, of taking also that customer in Europe by the hand into Web 3.0. And what is that journey in your mind for the farmer? And why are you so passionate, John, about the farmer? Well, I mean, there''s a couple reasons. One is I grew up on my grandfather''s farm. And so I love farming. Maybe when I was young and I was a computer programmer, I didn''t love farming so much and wanted to escape that world a little bit. But then, you know, the allure of farming became important to me. Over my years, I''ve been building software systems and built a number of ERP systems, business and logistic systems, for some of the biggest players in the world. And I spent a lot of time consulting in that area. And as I was doing that, we would work on food systems with big food players. And I found there was always a data disconnect between the farmer and the large food company. And enabling and closing that data disconnect gives us reams and reams of really valuable data. Data that we can do other things with. Data that we can monetize with universities, helping research, helping improve productivity on the farm. But the most important thing to me is every day I get up and I''m super excited about helping these farmers. You know, I did a project a number of years ago in the Congo. The government of Congo asked me to go. I spent a bunch of time there. And the farmers are so hardworking. You know, the average income of the farmer was about $600 a year. If we can increase their productivity, even if we increase their productivity 20%, and they were grossing, you know, $3,000 a year and netting $600 a year, that''s a huge impact. That doubles their take-home income. And that helps them build their community. And it''s amazing, these farming communities around the world and how they support each other. And it''s just like the crypto community. This is a community-based environment. And it''s just as easy for us, and maybe we do some extra work for it, to go and work with these organizations and help them improve their productivity. But it''s a great application for AI. It''s a great application for mobile. And it''s a great application for crypto. And thank you for that. That''s the reason I joined Dimitra two years ago. Because he''s so rooted in that community that we''re trying to help. I am, by the way, as well. I grew up in Germany in a farming community. But Carlotta, what excites you about Dimitra? Because you joined quite recently in October of last year. Yeah, indeed. I was not fortunate enough to be living on a farm growing up, but I would have loved to. And I think generally reconnecting to the land is very important. And what I found out around six years ago, I got into blockchain and crypto. And what really stuck with me was this protocol that I read on Ethereum that was enabling access for women to get loans in India. So entrepreneurs from the other gender could all of a sudden access finance. And so I got captivated by the crypto space because of the democratizing access that it gives. And then when it comes to agriculture, there are so many applications for it. And I thought, why not combining the both of them? Because I think empowering smallholder farmers is extremely important considering the numbers. And I do love to eat. I''m a foodie, honestly. So I care for food and I care for having traceable, organic, and I would say just sustainable food systems on our planet. Thank you for that, Carlotta. That''s their driver. My driver is meeting people and connecting people in the real world. And I have new friends that I made yesterday. I''m going to have many more new friends made today. So I want to reach out to you guys. Help us make that connection between your brains and your brain pool of your teams and our projects to take those farmers by the hand and guide them in a secure way onto the digital journey that we''ve been on all our lives. Thank you, guys. And I want some questions, one or two questions from the audience. Who''s got a question for me? For John, for Carlotta? It''s 2,000 people thinking. It''s 2,000 people. There''s a lady. Thank you. Please, the microphone runner. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your contributions. I was wondering, what is the one project that you are most proud of? Because you''ve been mentioning a whole bunch. Thanks. What are you most proud of, Carlotta? Well, I just came in as a director of ESG. So, of course, I''m proud of our collaboration with the biggest association of fruits in Brazil. I think we''re really going to be leading and revolutionizing sustainability in the fruit industry as Brazil is one of the major exporters of fruits. So that''s my own bias. Favorite project. I think that that''s a great project. And we went out and got Carlotta to come on and run this program. I''m so excited to have her. We worked with her on another project elsewhere. And she''s amazing to talk to. So please take the time to talk to her if you see her walking around here. Don''t underestimate Brazil. Brazil is the third largest exporter of fruit in the world. Our organization that signed us is the organization that manages 80% of the exports of fruit from Brazil. And they have a vision to work with everybody who buys Brazilian fruit in the world to comply with and be audited to a certain level from an ESG perspective. And there''s regulations coming out on this. So today people are doing ESG because investors want it, because it''s important to them, and because it''s the right thing for the earth. But in a year and a half... It will be mandatory. It''ll be mandatory for them. So imagine all of the fruits that are exported from Brazil will be running through our program in a year and a half. We have other organizations in the world that do that. And so I''m proud of it. One, because I get to work with Carlotta. But two, Brazil''s an amazing country to work with, and we have a lot of great relationships there. You know, I''m proud of our RWA program in Kenya. And we have this young, passionate guy. We went and partnered with a group there called One Million Avocados. And it was a young guy who loves avocados, created an organization to go and help avocado farmers. And an avocado farmer in Kenya makes about 50 cents a pound, or sorry, per kilo per avocados. On export, if we can prepare them for export and comply for ESG and comply for deforestation compliance, they can make about three times that amount of money. So if I look at an organization that has, I think, 57,000 farmers in Kenya that focus on avocado, taking them from 50 cents, when they have a landed cost to them of over 40 cents for an avocado, to $1.50 or $1.30, whatever price we can get in, depending on the market that day, by helping them digitize their process is really rewarding to me. And so the most rewarding thing to me is taking somebody who, with a little bit of technology and a little bit of effort, throw some AI at it, and a mobile app, simple mobile app that they can use, and tripling their income is super rewarding. I''ve been in tech my whole life, and it''s been a rewarding career for me. But the reason I moved away from big tech and most of my stuff has been enterprise, enterprise tech, is the ability to help people. Because when I was working for the big corporation, yeah, people were using the app, and a lot of Americans and Europeans were using the app, but in all reality, I never really felt like I made a big difference in their life. And what we do today feels like I can make a big difference in their life. Thank you for that. And thank you for that question. I''m very proud of the Ethiopian Coffee Project where we''re onboarding 1.2 million farmers right now. And I''m so excited to find the right partners that understand trade financing and this world to provide that liquidity pool for the next 18 to 24 months. That''s what I''m interested in right now and very excited. One more question. 90 seconds. Yeah, hi. Yeah, hi. I''m very new to the Web3 space, so this question may be a bit silly. I think I get what you''re doing, that you''re allowing access, easy access to data both ways. How do you ensure that that data is correct to begin with? So data on, I think you were talking about sustainability in farms and that there wasn''t deforestation. How are you auditing and checking that before that data gets onto the chain? And have you ever run into any problems with that? Short answer. Yeah, so there''s a lot of ways we validate it. Very first thing we do when a farm registers is we take a satellite snapshot of that farm and we built AI protocols to count the number of trees on the farm, to look at the canopy coverage on the farm. What percentage canopy coverage do they have? We can count the number of palm oil trees or the number, you know, and predict the yield. So we have a lot of algorithms that we''ve built in order to assess each individual farm from a sustainability perspective and from a productivity perspective. And then we back that up through an on-the-ground audit program. So Ethiopia, for example, each one of those cooperatives that we''re working on has auditors that go out. So we have service technicians. And then third, through, you know, Vera and different groups, gold standard, depending on the protocol, we need to follow a certain audit requirements as maybe 5% need to be audited or 10% need to be audited. We continue. Go find John. We can talk. Go find us. As we are out of time, it felt like a CrossFit workout where I have 10 seconds left and he''s going long. So thank you guys for being here. Please come see us. Talk to us. We''re here the next two days. Looking forward to it. Have a successful show. Thank you very much. We can just go right out here after. Like I saw, there were some other hands. Let''s talk. Happy to talk right now. Thank you. Have fun. Thank you. Thank you.', 'Music Morning everybody.

My name is Casey Lau. I actually do this kind of thing for a living. The last time I was in this room, we had Rise here in 2019. So it''s very exciting to be back here. I was at ConsenSys in Austin last year. And I got to say, the first year event here in Hong Kong is quite a big turnout. What do you guys think? Awesome. Yeah, right? Very exciting. So Hong Kong is back. I hope everybody gets a chance to look around Hong Kong while you''re in town. Check out some of the restaurants and nightlife. It''s very, very exciting. I understand 75% of the audience here over the next two days is from out of town, from out of Hong Kong. So it''s great to have you all here and check it out. So this panel we''re talking about, it''s about Hong Kong transitioning from a financial hub to Web3 hub, which I think is a very exciting conversation to have. And I have three amazing panelists that will get down to the business. One is from the government. One is from institutional. And one is from the metaverse or whatever. So please, starting with you, Evan, let''s start. Why don''t you introduce yourself and your company? What do you do? Sure. I''m Evan L. Yang, a group president of Any Mocha Brands. We are born from the cyber port, shall we say, right? So we''re one of the companies native to Hong Kong, native to Web3. We are known to be a prolific investor. But we essentially, we''re an investor, we''re an operator, and we''re an advisor at the same time, right? So our innovation pillar in the business operations allows us and gives rise to our ability to invest into now 540 companies, which then gives rise to our skill set and actually being able to advise, almost like a Goldman Sachs of Web3. So we bring projects that have digital asset aspirations to market, right? I, myself, came from a TradFi background initially. So I was at Bankers Trust in a city group in derivatives. And then I was at McKinsey for a number of years. And then I ran KMB, the county motor bus company, however, in Hong Kong, for profit bus company. And then GLG, which is an expert network firm, for a number of years. And I''m in Animal Group brands for four years, right? Which, if you count the dog years, that you should multiply by seven. So I''ve been in crypto for 28 years. So that''s how it feels, right? And this morning, you announced the exciting stablecoin year. So we''ll talk a little bit about that later on. King. Yes. Again, great to be here at ConsenSys. Finally, it''s happening. And you must call for those guests from overseas. We are 100% Hong Kong government''s department. And we are here to serve all of you. In fact, we are the relationship managers to help you succeed by connecting you to the capital, the various government funding, potential clients, the major institutions in the financial side, other major corporations. So this is what we do. Now, at the same time, the other hats that we wear is essentially to try to promote via this mining platform. So I see my colleague Jane here. So again, the Dysamia Festival. For instance, it''s a major platform for the various startups across different sectors. Another flagship event is the Hong Kong Fintech Week that we do in November. So these are essentially some of the platforms that we do together with collaboration, like ConsenSys, that we do marketing. And last but not least, we also work very closely with the policymakers, the regulators, essentially try to collect market intelligence to feedback what the market needs. So that''s what we do. So that''s what we do. I had a panel this morning talking to three startups who have all either been born in Hong Kong or came to Hong Kong. And one of them had nothing but high praise for InvestHK. She was from Taiwan. So InvestHK made it very, very easy for her to come to Hong Kong to start her Web3 business. So that was, I hope everybody from InvestK heard that. It was very good. And finally, Eddie. Hi, everyone. I''m Eddie Lau. Our firm is called Ata Tefen. We are listed in Hong Kong. So you can find a lot of information about us on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under Stock Ticket 279. So we are a hybrid. We call a hybrid financial service. We''re actually one of the most licensed companies in Hong Kong. So we''re brokerage business, asset management, custodian, money lending, whatnot. Most importantly, we actually are authorized to do it in virtual asset. So meaning we can mint STO. We can trade cryptos. We can do on-off-ram, meaning converting fiat to stablecoin or vice versa. We can advise people on projects. We keep custody of tokens for our clients. Obviously, we also have traditional assets, which is a bigger part of our business. We also have a team that is technology-driven. So the team is everywhere. Some of them are in Toronto and some of them are in Hong Kong and Beijing. That team is part of Ata, where we participate in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Project Ensemble Project, which is the Hong Kong blockchain infrastructure project. So our job is quite simple. I don''t know how long it will take. But our goal is to bring in, basically bring tokenized money together with tokenized assets. And also you''re on something called the Web3 Task Force? Yes. It''s an honor to be on that task force. It''s like an action movie, but it''s not. Well, there are 15 of us. I mean, Andy Mocha, actually. Yasu is on the committee as well. So we are very honored to be invited by the government to provide advice, meaning we push them quite hard to innovate, and they do. Okay, great. Okay, so for the audience, I want to kind of give a little context on Hong Kong. So 2024 was a big year. We''ll get into what 2025 looks like. But maybe starting with Evan, what was something in 2024 in Hong Kong''s Web3 scene that you thought was a highlight that kind of paving the way for 2025 and beyond? Well, you know, to talk about 2024 and even 2025, we would talk about sort of what happened in 2022 and 2023, which were very tough years, right? So 2024 actually began a little bit as a resurgence of sort of like the Web3 interest. It started with Game 5, which is sort of where we have been. And that wave sort of lasted four to five months, and there was a bit of a dull period during the sort of summer months. And it came back again towards the end of the year after Trump was elected, right? So that was the year. I wouldn''t say that that was a great year, in fact, but it was a year of sort of like, hey, builders, you know, and applications coming to bear. AI started in a lot of ways, right? And if you remember, besides Game 5, there''s infrastructure, right? So a lot of layer twos, right, big layers, layer zero, right, actually launched. And then it was an infrastructure in Game 5 kind of a year. Ultimately, for Hong Kong, I would say that if you bring in the context of where Hong Kong has been, is that there are lots of, shall we say, thinking and regulating going on in the back, right, which was not that apparent to the general public. But if you were to look at sort of the industry feedback on Hong Kong overall, is that it''s definitely very thoughtful but a little bit conservative at the same time, right? So there was an additional virtual asset license, virtual asset provider license that was granted, and there was OTC regulation going on, and then stablecoin is going on. So, again, a lot of stuff happening in the back. But are we as fast as we are in sort of like, you know, in developing Hong Kong into Web3 Hub? No, we''re not, right? So we''re doing well, but we can be faster. So one of the most important aspects of Hong Kong being a financial center is having liquidity, right? And there''s tons of liquidity in the traditional finance space for us here, but we don''t have the liquidity yet for sort of what we call universal assets trading, right? So we''re in the early innings, right? We''re probably a little bit behind that of, let''s say, Singapore. U.S., as we know, is going to catch up a little bit. So we have a lot of work to do. Okay, great. King, I''m sure you have this all written out, what happened in 24, right? It''s when you go on your tours around the world to promote Hong Kong. What''s one highlight you think is something that you''re very proud of? Well, the one thing that we have to say is that the government has done a good job in connecting the dots. Okay. So it''s not the one incident. It''s the ability to really connect a number of things and try to do well. And now we''re seeing the fruits. If I may just quickly paint a picture. So naturally, I think for those of you who have been in Hong Kong, you probably have seen the news about things like, you know, FAM office. You probably have heard that. There''s another policy around the what we call CIES, right? The capital investment engine scheme. And then there''s the fintech. And there''s the wealth management. There''s the crypto. In most cases, most people that I talk to, they got a bit confused, right? Because there are different pockets. But if I may, try to connect these thoughts together, which is something that the leadership and government have done a fabulous job. Now, let''s start with the IPOs. Because a lot of times when people talk about Hong Kong, this almost goes about saying by comparing us against Singapore. But I have to say that for any business, capital always goes first. So that''s why we think about even IPOs. So last year, we had a decent year. Not the best year. We did something like, what, 70 plus IPOs. Raising, I forgot the exact number. But I did a map. Actually, the number of deals was like 60, 70 plus versus four in Singapore. But the money raised from Hong Kong through IPOs last year was over 330 times of Singapore. Wow. 330. Yeah. 330. So, okay. Now, so let''s park that idea. Number two, now guess what? A lot of these kind of companies, when they''re listed in Hong Kong, then they would naturally, some of the founders, they''d like to sort of mobilize and monetize those money, right? So this is where the private banking and the EAMs, the family offices, people would come to play to essentially help this almost like new wealth to find a home to invest. Now, at the same time, for those people who are in finance, you will recognize that in recent years, there''s a strong movement towards investing in alternative assets and the crypto being one of them, right? Now, so that''s why when we look at just the breadth of offerings in Hong Kong, it''s great because of all these new innovation going on, there''ll be more and more like tokenized assets. There are more choices, right, for this new wealth to deploy the capital. So the point I''m trying to get to is that it''s not just one thing. It''s all these things. Now we are seeing that all the dots are being connected. And as a result, the whole financial sector is now really far up. And then also the RWA''s organization is also helping the other sectors like the shipping, the supply chain finance. So even the non-financial sector are also benefiting. So it''s really the series of events that are now really elevating Hong Kong to the next level. All right, great. Eddie, how about you? Last year, what''s the one thing that you tell everybody when you go overseas how great Hong Kong is and what a great year it was last year? Or was it? You know, I think one thing about Hong Kong that''s special is that it''s slow but moving forward. Okay. I mean, I won''t name names, but there are places where they move fast and they regress. Or they move fast and then they regret. We''re not like that. I think Evan pointed out a very good point. VA OTC. How do you deal with stable cons? How do you go off-RAM or on-RAM? Without a good OTC regime? Absolutely important. We''re slower than the other places, but when they come out, you guys will like it. One thing that I find interesting and I think people may have ignored and it could be relevant to you all, is the fact that Hong Kong government have done a lot with the tax regime. Long story short, if you''re running a crypto fund here, you should be able to get money. Raise money for yourself. First of all, you survive. You don''t pay tax anymore. Just like when you manage a stock portfolio, you don''t pay tax. And more importantly, this is a good place where you have infrastructure. I mean, this topic is financial hub, right? So if you have been trading or running hedge funds or running family office money or multi-family office money, this is a great place for you to express your investment in a very efficient way. It wasn''t that efficient before, but it''s going to get more efficient. And I guess you can come back next year and ask me, but it will be so efficient next year, lots of fun will happen here in Hong Kong. Why is it getting more efficient? What is the catalyst here? Look at me. First of all, the money is here. So I''ll give you an example. I mean, this is probably rolling back time. So I started trading in 2001 in New York with UBS. I was trading derivative and convertible bonds, stocks, whatnot. Arbitrage here and left and right and center. Computer get faster. We run to HFT. So roughly 10, 12 years ago, we started running HFT and index arbitrage in Asia''s onshore China. Short the index, long the stocks, run a basket, collapse, and you make 15%. That was cool and new. Nobody understands what the hell we''re doing except they give us money. Where do you get the money? Hong Kong, central. People give you money. And guess what? Rolling forward, now it''s 2025. What do we do? In crypto, we can do HFT, cross-exchange arbitrage. You can do funding arbitrage. You can do volatility arbitrage. Momentum trading CTA. I''m sure some of you guys would know, may have invested in them. You guys are an expert in it. But what matters is this makes 20-something percent return when your try-find stuff is making 5 or 10 and sometimes negative. So why aren''t people doing more of this? Tax reason? KYC, AML reason? Yep. Or they just don''t understand it? And the technology infrastructure, the license regime, the fact that how we set up OFC in Hong Kong, the way that SFC regulates, make it so easy already. So it''s a matter of time rather than how. Okay. That''s a great segue into the question I want to ask you now. So this week''s big news is Animoca, Standard Chartered, a traditional bank, and HKT. You guys have signed formally a joint venture to release a stable coin, one of stable coins in Hong Kong. Now, is it because now it''s more fast? You guys are able to move quicker now? Or maybe you can talk the audience through a little bit, quick points of how it came together and what''s your vision for it this year? Yeah, no, this is one of the most exciting initiatives that Animoca is undertaking because we''re native Web3 companies heading to what we call the institutional side. But you look at the executive management team that we have, we''re actually very, we came from pretty traditional backgrounds, you know, and then we have the visionary Yat Seal who, you know, lead us into sort of like the exploration of the innovation that we have. But this is one innovation is how do we bring the masses of Web2 into Web3, right? That''s the key thing. So what we wanted to do here is sort of, we understood that the Hong Kong government, led by HKMA, wanted to get into this digital asset space via a regulated manner, right? So they were looking at CBDC and looking at stable coins. And we looked at the opportunity and we were like, what is the right combination that would really get the adoption, right? So we began speaking to Sash Hardard 663 days ago. Okay. So we counted it, right? And then now we have it signed, right? And we''re like, okay, with a native Web3 company partnered with a traditional bank, that''s a really good combination, right? And now, of course, you have HKT as well, which is a, you know, traditional operator that can get to the consumer level, right? So we feel that this is the right combination, which will bring the right regulatory rails into a stable coin, which already has good use cases, as we know. And if you look at sort of where Twitter''s reaction to it is once we posted it, you know, one reaction was this changes everything. Why does this change everything? It''s because this is the first time we have a well-known, you know, commercial bank that''s innovative with very strong emerging market reach alongside a equally, I guess, well-known Web3 player, globally known in this space, and working on it together, then you have a combination of that plus an operator that would make it real on the ground, right? So this entry is very, very significant, not only for Hong Kong, but really globally. Globally, exactly. So King, how does this kind of exciting news, global news, first of its time, help you to get the rest of the government on board and accelerate faster things that other companies need to move faster in this space? Well, again, as Eddie said earlier, the task force and different closed-door meetings, in fact, I think you really ask around. We have a lot of international guests. Sometimes I miss Hong Kong. We organize meetings with the secretary, the undersecretary, the regulators, and so on. We constantly got the feedback that the policymakers and regulators are as open, as welcoming as it gets. So the first point I''m trying to get to is that we are listening to what a market needs. Okay, that''s one. So therefore, the speed thing that Eddie referred to, we totally get it within governments. It''s just a matter of executing. So that''s one. But most specifically, relating back to the exciting announcement from Evan, is that we are getting so much interest, particularly from the mainland Chinese companies, that in the past two years, they''ve been really coming down. We''re just so busy every day. We are welcoming all these incoming mainland delegations. Now, you may ask why. Actually, many of these companies are setting up their international headquarters in Hong Kong. Now, one of the things that they''re also doing as one of the sort of positioning is to set up the corporate treasury center in Hong Kong to do things that may seem simple. They may seem simple. That is cash pooling, liquidity management, treasury stuff. But things like stable coins, things like the project ensemble, the totalized market funds are now really getting these CFOs super excited. Yeah, great. Because they can now, wow, great. All these companies, many of them are manufacturing in Asia. They have different factories and supply chain partners, clients, literally around the world. So you can imagine the complexity for moving money in and out. Now, with stable coins, they can drastically cut down the B2B, right? The B2B money movements and also lower costs. Now, at the same time, you can imagine as a treasury guy, then if you have the digital money, be it the totalized deposits, or disabled coins, or CBDC, you have the digital money to pay for the on-chain assets in the form of things like totalized money market funds. So they can even manage the cash and get some extra yield much more efficiently. So that''s why many of these firms, again, we''re talking about like tens and hundreds of them and thousands of them coming from China to Hong Kong, they are really bringing the liquidity as well by parking the treasury in Hong Kong. So that''s why we''re just getting so excited. So now that we''ve got stable coins, we''ve got all these things, then we are really moving to the next level. Okay, that''s great. Okay, so Eddie, for 2025, is it stable coins, tokenizations, or the connection with the mainland that you''re most excited about? Well, actually, you know, most of the things I want to say, so I''m just going to add on what you say. I think for the audience here, I mean, I guess you''re here because either you''re interested in cryptos or you''re in finance and you want to learn about digital asset. Somehow this is kind of the future. So that''s 2025 or 26, 27, what should I do with this? My personal view on this is somehow Hong Kong had this, I don''t know whether it''s luck or by design, had this vision of building kind of everybody welcome infrastructures. It''s not there yet. It''s not even that obvious. But the project ensemble, what the regulator are doing, the government is doing, means that folks like Sarah Charter, which is a relatively traditional bank, which means that all of you, with a job that is relatively traditional, be selling bananas or apples, transferring money to Southeast Asia because you bought a better rice, can become relevant to tokenizations. I know that connection is hard to make, but I highly encourage you to participate into the Hong Kong project. Again, not obvious, obvious. But when you see tokenized asset coming out, please get involved. You buy one, you have a wallet, you trade one. it''s not perfect product on day one, but the power of smart contracts, the power of digital ID, and the fact that the public sector, the traditional banks, amazing companies that are innovative, like Animoca, us, a listed company with both TriFi and digital asset licenses, all of us are building somehow an ecosystem where everybody can get involved. I think that should be relevant to the audience here. Would it become the most dominating economy here? I think so. Because I think one distinction between Hong Kong and Singapore, I mean, I can''t help, but I have to bring out the name of Singapore, but Singapore is the center of Southeast Asia in a way for financial service, less so with commodity trading because Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand have their own economy. Hong Kong have mainland China and this mainland China cross-border flow just between Hong Kong and mainland and China versus other country means that what we''re building here is going to be so relevant to all of you. It''s going to be so widespread. And I think adoption ultimately is what people are looking for and you''ll be one of those who adopt it hopefully. And the adoption rate will be so high in two to three years in Hong Kong maybe a stable call, maybe tokenized deposit, maybe CBDC, maybe a tokenized real-world asset, God knows. But what matters is you''ll be using some of it. That would be the biggest prediction, I think. Okay, great. That''s awesome. Okay, I want to segue with kind of what you were talking about. I want to talk about Singapore because a lot of people, I think, from the U.S. that are in town or from Europe don''t understand the rivalry between Hong Kong and Singapore. It''s been there for many, many years, many decades. Definitely during Web2, a lot of the startups competed with each other who had the better investor scene, who had the most unicorns, things like that. You know, the biggest show in Singapore that will compete against ConsenSys is Token 2049. I think everybody knows and has been to that event. That used to be in Hong Kong, right? The founders are from Hong Kong. They moved over there because of the pandemic. I don''t think we''re going to get them back. The F1 is quite an alluring thing to be on top of. But we have ConsenSys, we have Web3 Festival, we have the FinTech Week, we have all kinds of great stuff. So I want to talk, like, Evan, you know, what do you see are some of the challenges and the benefits between Hong Kong and Singapore for building Web3? I know it''s a big conversation, but maybe pinpoint on one thing that you see because you guys have offices there as well, but you retain headquarters here in Hong Kong. What''s the allure here between us and Singapore? Well, I mean, you know, besides the fact that, you know, we are born and raised in Hong Kong, really, Hong Kong is a, sorry for Singaporeans out there, is a much more credible financial center. Okay, that''s good. Right? And then the quantity of talent that you see and the geographic location being in the smack middle of Asia makes a huge difference. We''re in the same time zone. Yeah. But if you sort of look at what we''re trying to build here, you are trying to leverage a bit of financial talent, which there''s plenty here, which can give rise to the FinTech space. That rail that we''re trying to build here, you can get the talent here, right? The tech talent, China, right? Some of the best talent in blockchain actually comes from China, right? They might be more on the private side or the more regulated side, which works for Hong Kong ultimately, right? If you go back a little bit to what we talked about, you know, leveraging what we talked about in the stable coin, what''s the purpose of us being here in the first place, right? So AnyMoka really, our entry into Web3 is founded upon the philosophy that the internet needs to be democratized, right? What does that mean ultimately? Data is not democratized today. Yes, there''s open access to the internet, but whatever you create comes back to you in forms of advertising. It''s not free. You might be manipulated and all of that. What we''re doing with decentralized ID via Mochaverse, via reputation layer, is the century of peer in the future about what the internet ought to look like, right? What does stable coin itself symbolizes as we enter it? It stands for, to us at least, that the banking system, the banking rails, in light of geopolitics, needs to also be neutral, right? Because at the end of the day, we know we''re under the SWIFT system, the US dollar system. Nothing wrong with that as long as geopolitically, we''re all friends. Now, are we all enemies? We''re not all enemies. We''re certainly not where we are 10 years ago. Right. So what you need is a 24 by 7 neutral, you know, crypto rails on public chains, right? That''s what you need to spur the adoption of financial system that will propel itself forward, right? The banking rails itself is old, okay? But it''s not that it doesn''t work. It works, but some elements of it need to be modernized. So where do you go? What''s the entry point, right? You definitely want 24 by 7 programmable atomic settlement money. That''s what you would want to go to. The banking side, even a bank that is as venerable as Santa Charter would go into it. But for us as NEMOCA, what we would like to see is ecosystem building, right? So you have to have that. The philosophy is what drives us forward, right? And then if you do the right thing, then your revenue as a profit should naturally flow in. That''s what we believe in. Yeah. Great. Awesome. King, you know, we''ve had some big crypto companies here in Hong Kong. Just as we were talking before, Amber, Nansen, they all started here. They eventually moved to Singapore. Do we try to get them back or do we just work with InvestHK to bring the new generation in or, you know, alleviate the ones that are here now? Well, first of all, on record, Amber, they are here. There are people in Amber. Amber people here. Okay. In fact, I''ll be going to the Amber party tomorrow night. Okay. Okay. Now, again, we know most of these players, the Nansen and so on. There was this, like, temporary situation from COVID that Singapore opened up like a year earlier. So that basically shifted a lot of the media focus that, oh, Singapore are getting a bit of these companies from Hong Kong. But guess what? A lot of these, the fam offices, the high net worths, you know, the companies, they are slowly moving back. Yeah. Some of them quietly, but we see, we see a whole landscape. Yeah. Now, of course, there are just so many of the, the hard facts I can go to. But like, in terms of time, I like to go a different track. I like to go on the intangible side. Now, I just want to sort of hear from the audience. By the way, who have you seen the movie Four Trails? Or maybe the video on YouTube, Four Trails. Okay. Now, I think if you have not, I highly encourage you to just find Four Trails on YouTube. And they''ll blow you away. Now, the reason why I like to use this as a way to sort of like give you like a different, different angle is because in my work, I''m just super grateful that Invest Hong Kong hired me to allow me to have this kind of exposure to see a lot of really smart people around the world. For most people who have been to Hong Kong, there''s some kind of magic in which it''s almost like love at first sight. People will be like, oh, I love Hong Kong. I like the hiking trail. I love the food. I love the Thai Pai Dong. There''s a special love to it. So that''s why when a lot of people move to Singapore during the pandemic, most of them are not by their own will. It''s just by necessity. Right? The school and everything for the kids. But now they''re coming back because they feel that this is a place that they love and enjoy their lifestyle. And we''ve been seeing that over and over and over again. So don''t listen to me. Just watch the four trails. There are literally a lot of expatriates in Hong Kong. They have run the trails and they have filmed the video, put it on YouTube before it became a cinema, a radio movie. And actually, guess what? A lot of these kind of viral activities happen in Europe because I happen to know some of the people running in the four trail video. And one of them is a CEO from Switzerland. His peers back in Switzerland saw the video. They''re like, wow, this is a different side of Hong Kong I''ve never seen. I have to see that. So they flew to Hong Kong just to experience the other side of Hong Kong and they love it. They decided to stay. So that''s the side that I want more people to listen and experience it besides all the hard facts that we are all so proud of. Okay. It''s called Four Trails. Four Trails. I''m glad that you''re watching YouTube in the InvestHK office. That''s awesome. I''ll watch it tonight. Watch it tonight. Yeah, I haven''t seen it either. I haven''t seen it either. Eddie, you are based here in Hong Kong but you travel the whole region of Asia. You''re in mainland, you''re in Southeast Asia, you''re in Japan and you just told me you speak fluent Korean and you love New Jeans and Blackpink a lot. So from that perspective, why don''t you tell us what you think of between Hong Kong and Singapore because you''re able to look at it maybe more from a holistic viewpoint instead of just between the two countries themselves. Just to make it clear, I don''t even have time to watch a movie so I''m traveling for work. Not for fun. I wish I''m trying for fun. We travel around the region because we have clients around the region. We have customers. What do they do with us? Guess what we are good at? Financial service. Capital market. People need money. People want to exchange money. People want to make investments. What''s the right way to put it? I think if you''re in crypto trading, so there''s somehow media focus around crypto people, crypto natives moving to Singapore and they have a lot of coverage around it and they ignore probably 98% or 99% of the rest of the population. They don''t cover them. So if you''re a crypto native trading cryptos doing DeFi, meaning DeFi, you know, stake, you lend and whatnot, maybe Singapore is just likely better today and here might work in 18 months time, Hong Kong regulation will catch up and you''ll be doing your DeFi here as good as in Singapore and I don''t see any reason why they don''t come back. So apart from the DeFi people, you''ve got a bunch of people who do on-around business. Guess what? We have stable cons. We make this Hong Kong dollar version regulated. We also have, you know, accepting like, you know, we have regime VAOTC that deal with unregulated tokens, so-called. USDT, USDC, you know, FDUSD, any stable cons out there. So, how can we be not the best place to, for someone with crypto to go into the banking systems? Legitimately. With KYC, AML, KYT, with a perfect regulatory regime. This is like going to training. Sorry, I''m a bit overweight, so I need to lose weight. Trust me, if I go to gym every day for three hours, I assume I don''t have to do my full-time jobs, you know, I will have time to go to gym. For after one month, I can play very good football. This is where the banking system is today. It''s an overweight banking system. They need to go to gym, need to be training up on how to deal with cryptos. How do you understand? When someone presents at USDT, you don''t stop them because they are proper people. They earn it in a proper way. So, give it another 12 months to 18 months and what happening with Anymocha, with Audi and all those stable cons are awesome because you''re training the banks, you''re training the regulator to accept basically digital currencies. So, these are the two reasons why generally, a crypto guy will come to me and say, I''m in Singapore. And trust me, in 18 months time, they''re sitting right here with us. Right, yeah. If not 24 months. Last but not least, the reason why we travel is that, guess what, if you, there are three reasons why I travel and three reasons why they talk to me. Hey, Eddie, I have a project. I want to tokenize it. As a matter of fact, sometimes, can you sell stocks, which is a tri-file product, along with tokens that''s regulated? Absolutely, Hong Kong is welcome. By the way, if I can''t sell a token, at least I can sell the stocks. Be public shares or public shares. So, the power of capital market here is tremendous because ultimately, people just want the capital. And Hong Kong is, in a way, better than Singapore. I remember there was a discussion, sorry, I ran out of time, but exactly 10 years ago when the Hong Kong Stock Connect was there, there were a bunch of hedge funds trading China stocks saying that they want to be in Singapore. And while others want to be in Hong Kong, guess what, the Hong Kong one absolutely outperformed. AUM is better, performance better because they''re closer to the company. So, you''ve got to be in here in the right market to raise capital. But finally, last but not least, I mentioned tokenized money, I mentioned security tokens, I also mentioned all of RAM. I want to highlight the fact that the government becomes so embracive and things are happening around all this institution that basically make up the whole economy of digital asset. The kind of integration between TriFi and DeFi or digital asset, we won''t have time today to go into deep dive into it, but trust me, this is moving so fast. When I go down to Singapore, I don''t feel it. Okay. Great. Okay, I''ve got a bunch more questions for you guys, but we''re running out of time. So, let''s give a round of applause to the panel here, but also thank all of you for being here to learn more about Hong Kong. Invest HK''s booth is right over there. Evan and Eddie will be out here to take questions over here afterwards. Thank you. Also, Annie Mocha booth over there. Oh, Annie Mocha booth over there. Eddie, where''s your booth? Next year. All right, great. A lot of free drinks. Thank you. Oh, scary photo. Yeah, we should do a photo. Okay.', 'Hello, everybody.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('f15c6f1d65', 'A Blockchain Revolution: Splitting by Ultima Chain Opens New Horizons', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' My name is Alex Reinhardt. I''m a serial entrepreneur, investor, founder of many projects. And today we are here not to catch money or asking for investors or looking for some support. Today we are here like investors, like developers, and to invite also projects to support fundamental growth of the blockchain. Because guys, you know, the market, the crypto market right now is in a revolution stage. It means that, yeah, you can see what''s happening on the blockchain market right now. The alt season is out. Meme coins rocking everyone. Presidents of big countries starting on meme coins. And altcoins are very down all the time and nobody can understand anything because there''s nothing the same today like it was before. And it means the big, big crypto revolution is coming. Right now we have projects on the market on the one side who are fighting for fundamental business. And on the other side, they are just playing some games and trying just to collect money in the NFTs or meme coins or futures. And everything is one big, very interesting, but not really profitable game. And we are here. If we can see on the market, the market is growing. The number of projects is growing. Capitalization is growing. But there''s very low number of real business behind. Because, of course, we can play games and do a little bit gambling with cryptocurrency. But normal people need more business in the background where you can earn long term, stable money. Where you can not only win something to lose it later, where you can really create assets, where you really can create wealth. And one of the fundamental business, of course, is mining. And yeah, mining is, I think this is a base of all the crypto market, especially mining of Bitcoin. And yeah, normally all the fundamental projects, they focusing on the Bitcoin growth of the development of the Bitcoin. And the main coins on the market, they just following the trend. If the Bitcoin is going up, everyone going up. If Bitcoin goes down, everyone goes down. But for real investors and experts, this is not very interesting to invest in coins who are just following the trend. Because why to invest in these coins? You can straight invest in Bitcoin. They are all looking for cryptocurrencies who are not following the trend. Who can just explode and just can change the trend or they are following their own trend. These are opportunities where investors are looking for and the same opportunities we are looking for. Yeah, for projects who are able to survive in this very strong competition and offering really fundamental technology, ecosystem, idea. So if you have projects like this behind, we have our Ultima chain stand. Just come to our stand, let know each other and find the communication. And maybe something very interesting will happen. So we with Ultima creating also very big and strong fundamental ecosystem and fundamental project. And our goal is to combine mining, staking and we have invented additional way of business named splitting. Maybe you have never heard about splitting before. But this is very interesting technology where people can just generate their assets on the smartphone just with one click. Because, you know, the cryptocurrency is pretty difficult business. Very risky. You need very strong nerves. Yeah, you need to stay calm and you have to adopt any stress on the market. To balance any stress on the market. And the splitting technology is something what you can apply by everyone''s normal and regular purpose. You don''t need a special education for this. You don''t need a special knowledge. You just need a little bit of time a day, maybe three to five minutes just to click the button. What is splitting and what''s Ultima standing for? The Ultima is supporting the combination of mining, staking and splitting. It means it creating the absolutely full stage of business. What everyone can do just from home. This is very energy friendly. This is combined with lifetime rewards. It''s very important and very easy to use by just clicking off one button. So, how it''s working. It was created a liquidity pool in the blockchain. And this liquidity pool you just need to contact one time a day to get daily rewards. If you get these daily rewards, you can use them every day by exchanging on the exchange, by buying products, by uploading your card, by refreezing it again, to send it to staking, to use it by voting. Same like Tron doing by selling your energy resources or bandwidth resources on market. So, many, many use cases are given on the Ultima chain. This is very easy. This is very easy to use. You just have to freeze your coin and just click your button after 24 hours. And then everything in the background will be done automatically by blockchain itself. So, we have already many, many users. They clicking every day. And if they... Why it''s important to click in our ecosystem to produce transactions. You produce transaction, you burn gas, you freeze coins, you create demand, create liquidity. The price is growing. Just you know, if you go and right now to coin market cap, you will see incredible price. The Ultima coin is... The price of Ultima coin right now is rent about $20,000. Not 20 cents. Not $2. Not $200. Not $2,000. Not $2,000. $20,000 is the price of Ultima coin right now. So, and the project is already more than two years on the market. The technology will be used already by hundreds and thousands of people. And till end of this year, we''re expecting minimum 3 million users. Who are using this project together with us. The same technology what we''re using here, we are ready to share with other projects. That everyone can repeat the success of Ultima on his own product, on his own coin. And that everyone can apply the same technology for his own asset. Because the way is very easy. Just freeze, just click, just take reward and take benefit. Yeah, this is the way. Yeah, you just request the reward and receive the reward real time immediately. It''s taking just a few seconds. Yeah, the Ultima blockchain is running right now. So the Ultima chain is running not so long before we was working on different blockchain just because the Ultima was just a token. Now it became to a coin, to the mother coin. And of course, can be used as the gas fee, can be used for staking, for voting and promising pretty good rewards every day. Yeah, the Ultima coin was created for math adoption. It was created for easy usage. And especially, this should be an example how you can build up with your project, with your asset, really fundamental technology, fundamental business. Because behind Ultima, it''s not just the ecosystem, not just a coin. This is really fundamental business with debit cards, with hardware wallet, with marketplace, with more than 7 million goods on it, with freezing programs, with exchanges and of course, splitting technology and daily rewards. Yeah, this is again how it''s working. And this procedure you can apply on any token. Ultima is just an example. If you have any token and maybe you are in trouble, maybe you were pumped and now you are dumped and very low price. Then by applying of our technology, you can push your asset, push your token very high. And not like a pump, you can do it on a very logical, natural way and without any manipulation. Because this is the technology behind. You have only to create your own split. Your users have to freeze it, have to click it every day and have to take the reward daily. And so they will fall in love with your token and your community will grow so much more. In our ecosystem, we have a lot of projects and products. This is just a couple of them. We have our own wallets, we have our own marketplaces with millions of goods. We have our hardware wallets, our own debit card in physical and plastic in virtual version too. We have also our staking technology, pools, liquidity pools. And of course, marketplace for resources. Same like Drone Energy for example, where you can really profitable in real time, sell your energy, sell your bandwidth. Where you can create really business behind. And yeah, this is the most important. Not only play the gambling game in the cryptocurrency market. This is very important also to create fundamental business. What you can run for years and not only for days or months. So about Ultima chain, it''s not much to say. We are strictly, we have really strictly limited coin supply. We have smart contracts inside. The Ultima chain is running on delegated proof of stake technology. It''s around about 2 to 3 seconds what will be needed to create a block. It''s up to minimum 2,000 transactions per second. So very fast and very useful blockchain. And of course, our technology is providing utility to normal people. Because most of them, they don''t have the right education. They don''t have the right skills, knowledge. They are just dreaming about to come to the market and just do something very simple. And what can be more simple than just click one button a day. It''s very simple. Everyone can do this. Doesn''t matter in what culture or in what country this person is. So the Ultima coin is listed also already on Gate, Maxi, BingX, Bitmark. We are preparing tier 1 exchanges also. But this is only the beginning of the project and of the project. And yeah, listed on CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko. You can see this live in your smartphone. As I told you already, yeah, to the time where the presentation was done, the price was 19,000. The highest price was 22,000. I think yesterday or two days before. Today it''s 20 something. It''s not so volatile a coin. It means for traders. It''s also very interesting. You can predict the price development. And this should be only an example. I''m not selling you something here or I''m not advertising here the Ultima coin to buy or something. I''m not. The price is $20,000. We don''t need to do this. But this should be an example how any other project can be successful on the crypto market and can survive if he applying the right strategy and right technology on his assets. So, of course, if the founder is really interested to run long term business or not only to pump the coin and then take the money and disappear in one, two weeks or months. So, yeah, the price is also very interesting after Bitcoin is the number two coin in the price growth and price development. Of course, we''re still in the position 200 because 200 plus because the listing on tier one exchanges is still not happened. But we''re working on it very hardly. But I think this year it will be done. We''re already in discussion with tier one exchanges. So, the trick behind or the know-how behind is the market. The basement on the hyper deflation. It means that coins if they starting the rally on crypto market they producing billions of tokens. They creating crazy rates of minting or farming of cryptocurrency. And they creating very big inflation. And the inflation is the biggest enemy of the price growing. So, we apply or we applying completely different strategy. We, yeah, we applying the strategy of hyper deflation. It means that every year the number of tokens about the halving, about the special procedures getting lesser and lesser and lesser on the market. If the supply is going down, the price is growing automatically. So, this methodology we have applied around about 10 months ago. That you know, the price of Ultima coin was in June of this year just $2,000. Now, 20 and 22. It''s 10x in just 10 months. Only because of this technology. And this technology we want to share with different projects. We can see a lot of them here. And I think many of them who will start the projects on our Ultima chain will succeed very fast and yeah, very big. Yeah, that''s it. Yeah, I''m almost in time. And yeah, the Ultima is just more than just a cryptocurrency. This is entire ecosystem. And again, we''re pretty big in Europe. We''re pretty big in Latin America. We''re pretty big in India. But in Asia not. And I hope that very soon I will see here not only a couple of people. I will see thousands and thousands. Normally I speak in front of 10, 15,000 people. But here I understand this is my first speech in Asia. And yeah, consensus. The Ultima is not very known here. But we will change it very soon. And I hope that next time if you see somewhere advertisement of Ultima, you''re remembering me. You''re remembering the chain. And you will be our guest because we will absolutely for sure come to Asia and Hong Kong especially. The next time also to next cities. So just if you''re interested in cooperation, if you''re looking for also investors. And if you''re looking for opportunity to grow your business idea. Behind is the Ultima chain stand. So just join us and speak to my colleague, to my team. And yeah, let''s stay in contact. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('f2a30610e7', 'Spotlight on Hong Kong', '待定', 'Keynotes & Welcomes', ' . My name is Casey Lau. You may know me from Rise, which we used to have in this same place here in Hong Kong. Thank you for that one cheer. But mostly I do Web Summit, which is a big tech conference around the world. I''m actually going to Qatar right after this for our conference there. But I''m very excited to be supporting Hong Kong. I also am the co-host of the GM Show. It''s a weekly series that I do with Meme Land, talking to founders in Web3 space. So of course they thought of me to host this panel with three builders here in Hong Kong. How many people are from Hong Kong in the audience? Okay, a few people. Great. How many people are not from Hong Kong in the audience? Okay, two. We''re going to convince you guys to move to Hong Kong at the end of this 30-minute panel. So let''s start to the gentleman on my left. What''s your name and what does your company do? So my name is Jacob and I''m the CEO and co-founder of Clearpool Finance. Okay. We are a marketplace for private credit and we''re doing this on-chain. So we are a DeFi protocol. Great. One of the, I guess, leading DeFi protocols out of Hong Kong. Out of Hong Kong. Great. And where are you from originally? Originally, I''m from Italy. Italy! But I''m in Hong Kong since nine years already. Okay. So I''m a permanent resident. Nice. I consider myself a Hong Konger. Okay. I came here nine years ago. I thought I''d come for, you know, six months or something. Yeah. And, you know, here we go. Nine years later, I''m still here. What''s your favorite restaurant? What''s your favorite restaurant? That''s a good question. Let me think. Oh, I have a lot of favorite restaurants. I think I went to the, oh my God, what''s it called? Chilli Fagara. Okay. Chilli Fagara restaurant in Central. Nice. One of my favorite restaurants. Okay, great. Sorry. I just threw you on the spot like that wasn''t a pre-planned restaurant question. And next to us, Jackie. Oh, what is your name? What do you do? I''m Jackie. I''m a local born Hong Kongers. I live in Hong Kong. I study in Hong Kong. So I just been an OG in Hong Kong as well. Yeah. And my company is called Pousa. It''s a global market making firm. So we train all the biggest exchange and we provide liquidities to the people so that they can trade with a much more low storage. Yeah, that''s it. And I''m very excited to be here. Awesome. Jackie, there''s two people here that are not from Hong Kong. Where do you think they should go while they''re in Hong Kong this week? This week? Of course, going to Consensus first. Okay. What food or what local Hong Kong thing they should do? What food? If you really want to try some local food, then I would recommend going to Namjee. Namjee. Yeah, Namjee. Very tasty. Okay. Good, good, good. All right. And Sarah, tell everybody what your name is, what your company does. Hi, everyone. I''m co-founder of Aegis Custody as well as Aegis Clearing Company, D-ACC. Digital Essay Clearing Company. Sarah is a company. I''m a co-founder of Aegis Custody as well as Aegis Clearing Company. The E-A-C-C. Digital Essay Clearing Company. Sarah and we do regular custodians in the United States, in Hong Kong and Singapore. But specifically in Hong Kong, Digital Essay Clearing Company aims to be like DTCC. Okay. Where they are public-private partnerships as well as participants from different financial institutions. Great. And where are you from originally? I was born in Taiwan. Taiwan. Okay. And how long have you been in Hong Kong? So, I got into Hong Kong through the talent program. Okay. So, I got a Hong Kong ID card. That''s great. You need that. That''s really good. Yes. And so, do you have a favorite place you like to go to in Hong Kong? I mean, Taiwan has some great food, but is there a Hong Kong thing that you love? Yeah. I normally go to Caprice. Caprice. Okay. All right. That''s fine. That''s fine. Okay. So, this panel is about shining a spotlight on these builders in Hong Kong and learning a little bit about how they started, why they''re here, and we''ll compare it to other regions in Asia. But I want to first of all start with Jackie, because he''s the OG. You started the first. So, your company is actually 10 years old. So, you were before ICOs even. Yeah. Before ICOs. Before that stuff, right? So, tell us a little bit about why did you start your business here in Hong Kong? What did it look like in 2015 compared to today? Okay. Yeah, sure. Definitely. So, my company is a global market-making firm. So, we have presence in Hong Kong. I have lots of back office and middle office here doing helping us to make us grow. So, I think like in 10 years before, right, when you talk about cryptocurrency or BTC, people will think that it''s a scam. It''s like all about money laundering. They still do. Has it changed? Yeah. Yeah. But at that time, it''s even more worse. More worse. Okay. Yeah. Money laundering, buying drugs online. Okay. Yeah. All that and stuff. Right. So, I''m trying to have a business in cryptocurrency. Oh, are you doing something illegal? Yeah. Oh, please don''t. Don''t start. Yeah. And it''s even more hard when you talk to business partners or banks. If you want to be a local business, you must have a bank account, right? Right. And it''s 10 years before, it''s very, very hard to tell them what kind of business you''re really at. Yeah. I think now it''s much better because like much more people are accepting about cryptocurrencies and all those stuff. But still, this is one of the challenging point when we are talking about having a business in Hong Kong. Yeah. Right. Are you going to bring your family to ConsenSys to take a look at this giant crowd here? It looks legitimate, right? Yeah, of course. It''s definitely legitimate now. I mean, nowadays, I mean, no one will say that Bitcoin is a scam or anything. Right. Great. Okay. Sarah, same question to you. Why did you start from Taiwan? Why did you come to Hong Kong and start building your business out of here? Yeah. So we actually started in the States. Okay. So even though I was born in Taiwan, I''ve been living in the States for over a decade. Well, I think the difference between now and maybe over six and a half years ago when we started is because we''re dealing with many financial institutions now. Yeah. So like onboarding, previously, like we onboarded like Binance US in the US. So the onboarding process of that versus now onboarding a bank is quite different. Yeah. The questionnaires that just get it added out recently, it''s just unbelievable. You''ll be addressing a lot of issues that you never imagined that you have to. So I think that''s the challenge is like even getting or even like doing clients or work. There''s just a lot more requirements in addition to the regulatory as well as in addition to compliance. Great. Okay. Awesome. Jacob, I know I''ve been to Italy and I''ve seen their tech ecosystem. So I know why you came to Hong Kong. Yeah. Just kidding. Oh, no, that''s not true. I''m not kidding. That''s true. So tell me a little bit about, so you weren''t into crypto when you landed in Hong Kong, but you eventually got into it. Why did you decide to make your business here in Hong Kong in the Web3? Yeah. So as I mentioned, I came nine years ago. I was one of the earlier guys for Food Panda for Hong Kong and Asia. So quite a change later into FinTech. And I think the main reason of making Hong Kong the hub was just that I was here. And I think the special thing about Hong Kong is Hong Kong is extremely crypto. The population is very crypto passionate, savvy or passionate. Right. You know, everyone in that, whenever there''s like a cycle, you know, whether there''s NFTs, the whole city basically speaks crypto. Right. Everywhere you go, you see buses, the whole MTRs are plastered in, you know, NFT ads, et cetera, et cetera. So it was during that time when, you know, you just get sucked up into this crypto world. You start looking at it. And then I think, you know, Hong Kong was definitely one of the best places or still one of the best places. But it was the place for crypto. Yeah. It was easy to get a little bit of a network, you know, meet important people. That''s how I met my co-founder. Yeah. You know, who was already in crypto for a longer period of time. And, you know, it just naturally progressed to have Hong Kong as my base. Yeah. So it wasn''t like a conscious decision. It was just being here and having been influenced by Hong Kong. Have you been back to Italy recently? Yeah. I''m being back. It''s great because sometimes when, you know, the market''s really bad, I go back to Italy. Nobody knows about Bitcoin, about all of those things. It''s great. FTX collapsed here. Everyone is depressed. I go back. People are like, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? What? That''s awesome. Yeah. That''s a vibe I get when I go to Europe. Exactly. Okay. So I deal mostly these days with Web 2 startups, right? And with Rise Web Summit, we do a lot of Web 2 stuff. And Hong Kong was a thriving place with many unicorns and stuff like that. Since the pandemic, kind of gone downhill. So a lot of startups are leaving because there''s no money, there''s no talent, and there''s no market here. But you guys are all building Web 3 here. So this is my question to you. We have all of these three things here, right? We have the talent, we have the market, we have capital. What are your thoughts on what''s missing from Hong Kong? Sarah, let''s start with you. Well, I think in the institutional Web 3 space, even though we have interacted over 10 banks in Hong Kong, the adoption process takes time. Yeah. And especially, you know, Hong Kong, you have the Western Bank, you have also Chinese-related bank. So like, even though Hong Kong is pushing for Web 3 for financial institutions, a lot of the Chinese banks, they were still uncertain about whether, you know, the Beijing government will support. Yeah. Okay. So I think that''s where I think it needs, I''m actually not sure whether it needs more clarity for Hong Kong or needs more clarity from Beijing. But that''s one of the reasons that some of the banks really wanted to, but they are afraid of, you know, making a big stride. One of the big things the government says here, one country, two systems. That''s a big thing. Seems like sometimes it''s good, but sometimes it''s also bad, especially for business, right? How about you, Jackie? What about you? How have you seen Hong Kong in this idea? I think when we are looking at like the crypto industry in Hong Kong, right? I think like in the old days, like Hong Kong was really a great place for crypto business. Like some of the big names are from originally from Hong Kong, right? Bitfinex, the Tenfa issuers, and then Bitmax, and then even FTX, right? Yeah. Although it''s gone, but it''s still, it''s originally from Hong Kong. Yeah, it''s still in our hearts. Don''t worry. I still have a tote bag. Oh, you still have your tote bag. I got one as well. Yeah. But anyway, but I think during the COVID was the place where the system or the government changed about how they want to do a business and how they try to shut down. So that makes, like, as you said, lots of like Web 2.0 and other builders like freeing away from Hong Kong. Yeah. But after the, now the COVID is gone, right? I think all the major infrastructure of things are still in Hong Kong. So I think if it gives them some more back time, I think Hong Kong still be a good place for like founders or builders to build their own stuff. Is there anything missing though? Do you think? I think you''ve seen the most. Ten years. That''s a long time. Yeah. I think one of the major things that can catch up is about the regulator stuff. Because like now, if you look at US after Trump coming in as the president, right? Everything goes so fast. Like even has its own Trump coin, right? Yeah. Right. So it''s so up okay on those cryptocurrencies. But in Hong Kong, it''s like the world is like moving ten step. But Hong Kong is just like moving one step. Yeah. It''s just now talking about OTC, talking about stable coins. But everything is talking about other things already. Okay. Makes sense. Makes sense. Okay. Cool. Jacob, what about you? So many great things in Hong Kong. What''s something missing maybe that you think should be? Yeah. So I think the great things in Hong Kong, I think Hong Kong has a lot of, you know, very smart traders. I guess people like Jackie and his team. So a lot of the big trading firms, you know, originated from Hong Kong. And there''s really a lot of smaller trading firms, you know, all over. Many of them are, you know, still market leading. I think on the other side, like, you know, the sort of like builder side, application builder side, Hong Kong is probably not that strong. Okay. I think even traditionally Hong Kong is not really the place for startups. There are a few but like I would say it''s a little bit less developed than some other places in the world like like the Bay Area. Hong Kong is a, you know, financial city, it''s a market city. So you have a lot of strong people there. Yeah. Maybe on the talent side, I think Hong Kong is not really known to be a place for developers. Right. You probably have a lot of good sort of like trading people for like finance guys, and less builders, less people on the on the on the on the development side. How do you think Hong Kong can encourage that more? Yeah, so I think I think right now, even as a as a government initiatives go, right, I think there''s a lot of like, very good initiatives on the sort of like institutional side. Yeah, I think for you know, and myself, we''re more like, you know, crypto native DeFi player. I think I think maybe that is one of the areas that is slightly less supported. Yeah. And I think Hong Kong can and should make a push in supporting, you know, this initiative. It''s a little bit more. Okay. Yeah, great, great. Okay. So I want to ask now, I know, Sarah, we talked before, you know, your team is very remote. Everybody''s working in different places. I live in Hong Kong. And also, I know a lot of Web2 companies, Web2 ecosystems really require capital and ecosystem. How do you feel about these things here in Hong Kong, as opposed to maybe Taiwan? Maybe Taiwan? Okay, the US like Silicon Valley, that''s like a special tier everybody wants to be a part of, right? But how do you see that these two things work together in Hong Kong? Do you feel it that that these two things are strong here, could be stronger, are pretty strong? You mean capital and talent or? Yeah, and ecosystem. Like this event here, this is the first consensus we''ve had here. But last year and the year before, we''ve had a few different kind of conferences. But this is quite a large scale international event, right? The organizers just told me 75% of people are from overseas. So it''s only a quarter of the people here are from Hong Kong or from this specific region. So everybody wants to know, does Hong Kong have the capital for startup investment and also talent and also the ecosystem like this continuously? I do think Hong Kong has exceptional talents, especially for Web3 and finance. And then there are so many people that are coming from Stradify that have already worked in digital assets for many years. I don''t think Hong Kong is a place for capital, especially for startups. I think that''s probably more for Singapore among Asian countries. Ecosystem, I would say probably yes. I mean, there are still quite a lot of companies that are from overseas as well as from Hong Kong perspective. And then I think overall, yes, compared to different regions, whether that''s US, Hong Kong, Singapore, where we all have license. Hong Kong does require the most heavy local infrastructure building. So definitely, I think the team we''re setting up, the infrastructure we''re setting up in Hong Kong is the most heaviest among all the other regions. So definitely, you''re going to see bigger teams, more operations, more infrastructure, which are also required by the regulations. Okay, interesting. Okay, Jackie, you''ve never raised any capital, but you hire people over the last 10 years. Do you find the talent good? And also, do you participate in the ecosystem? Do you host events? Do you go to events? You know, just that kind of vibe so everybody knows what''s happening in Hong Kong. Yeah, I think for like in Hong Kong, if you want to hire good developers, especially on the finance side, it''s much easier. Because like I said, Hong Kong is worse, a financial center, right? So there''s lots of talent from the traditional banks, investment banks. So that is not really the hardest part. But if you want to like, want to hire someone from DeFi. So I think this is something Hong Kong people is not originated. Yeah. So this is the hardest part. If you really want to find this kind of person, you maybe need to find another place like Taiwan or even in the Europe place. So it''s one part. The second question is? Like the ecosystem. Oh, the ecosystem. Yeah. To be fair, I think the ecosystem in Hong Kong is more around about finance as well. Yeah. So all the big names is all about exchanges. Right. Yeah. Like stable coins, those kind of stuff. But not like really builders to build the infrastructure of the blockchain. So you think there''s a lot of people talking on the top line of crypto, but not a lot of builders meeting up and sharing ideas. Like the Bay Area does that a lot, right? There''s a lot of developers, engineers talking about stuff. Okay. I agree with you on that one. How about you, Jacob? Yeah. I think, I mean, I do think there''s definitely like a good sort of, you know, there is a good ecosystem as well on the ground. I think Hong Kong, one of its unique advantages is just, I would say it''s, you know, it has less to do with, you know, regulation, all those things. I think just as a city, Hong Kong is a very good place to meet and have drinks. Yeah. Right? You just walk around, bump into people. Everyone kind of like lives in the same, like three districts. Yeah. Everyone has the office in the same, you know. I mean, you can walk like 10 minutes that way, 10 minutes that way and nearly everyone is there, right? So, you just, it''s very easy to meet up. It''s very easy to have drinks. It''s very easy to go to different offices. I was just telling to Jackie that I never made it to his office, but they''re known to have, you know, nice drinks there as well. So, definitely, I think that''s happening. We''re going there afterwards. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Nice views. So, that''s definitely happening. And I think, you know, one of Hong Kong''s unique strengths is that sort of proximity and that sort of like vibe that, you know, I think you have the same in traditional finance. Yeah. And that does foster a good ecosystem. But it definitely weakened. It definitely got less over the last couple of years. Yeah. Just because there has been a little bit of a net outflow of companies from Hong Kong to Singapore to Dubai. Yeah. And, you know, a lot of the large companies as well. A lot of exchanges. Things seem to change. Everyone''s set up. And then now it seems like everyone is slowly, slowly, like exiting again. Yeah. Okay. That''s a great segue to my next question. So, I''ve seen the same thing. Last couple of years, since the pandemic''s over, a lot of people have left Hong Kong, go to Singapore, go to Dubai. Right. We all know this is the normal story because Hong Kong''s restrictions were so tight. Right. It was very difficult to do business. So, a lot of people left. But now I see people are slowly coming back. But, you know, it''s been almost five years. If they had kids, the kids are like probably in high school now. So, it''s hard to just move people around. So, I feel like when I came to Hong Kong, I was in my early 20s. So, I came here. I believe the next generation are coming in are in their early 20s. I don''t know if this is being streamed, but if there''s people outside of Asia looking at coming to Asia. My next question will now be the big question everybody wants to know. Hong Kong versus Singapore. Right. This is the two things. So, I don''t know how many people are in Singapore. I''ve been to Singapore. When I go to Singapore, it''s like Asia-lite. Right. You go there. They got Orange Julius. They got all the famous American brands. Maybe more famous brands than we have. We got the Japanese brands here. We got the Korean brands here. Right. We got the mainland brands here. So, I see that. Right. And so, I want to know from you guys, starting with you, Sarah. What is the differences that you see between Hong Kong and Singapore for doing a startup specifically? Well, I just see an old friend from Invest Hong Kong. We were actually invited by Invest Hong Kong. They were really good at building relationships way back in the U.S., I think over five years ago. Definitely. So, we''re really appreciating them making that effort. And actually, when we first landed, they were also really helpful to help us get the world out. And even, I think, for our journey to get one activities. So, we offer digital clearing services for type one broker dealers uplifted for VA activities. It''s an over one-year process, including communicating with the regulator. And all the way, we have to communicating with the government as well. And then, Invest Hong Kong has been extremely supportive. I haven''t seen her for over a year. But, yeah. I think that''s the difference. I think we were really lucky to get the support from the government to land in Hong Kong compared to Singapore. Even though we''re also regulated in Singapore. Okay. Great. Yeah. All right. If anybody wants to know, the Invest HK booth is right there. You can go there. They''ll show you more of how to get into Hong Kong. Jackie, have you been to Singapore and looked at the market there? I''m sure you have, right? Yeah, definitely. I''ve been in Singapore to look around how the atmosphere, how the business is going. I do see that people in Singapore is more injected and then they are more like crypto friendly at the point. So, I think if we''re compared to Hong Kong and Singapore, I think it''s the old question about how the regulators look at like cryptocurrency and stuff. I think for Singapore, it must be more willing to accept them. And if we''re talking about Singapore, of course, we talked about Dubai, right? Dubai is like giving the 0% tax for crypto company, right? So, if you''re going to start a new company, a new crypto company, and you don''t have a place chosen in mind already, then the first thing you''re going to think is always Dubai, but it''s like 0% tax. And it''s, yeah, a very big advantage on that. But does Dubai have an ecosystem as good as like Singapore and Hong Kong? That''s, I think it''s very important. I think currently, if I compare now, I think Hong Kong and Singapore must be better. But you see that like things are going very fast in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, right? The biggest exchange are all selling the headquarters there. So, you will see that things will migrate quickly if like Hong Kong is not doing anything to stop it. So, the money part is important, right? Because I feel like 0% tax will not always be there. One day, it will show up again like in some other countries that have already popped back in. So, people have to decide, do they really get value out of that country than they would if they just stayed in a country that had tax, but has an ecosystem and everything already there, right? Okay, how about you, Jacob? You''ve been to Singapore. Probably have a lot of friends in Singapore, but you stayed in Hong Kong. What do you see as the two pros and cons of the two? Yeah, I mean, I love Singapore. I love Singaporean food. I''m just a little bit more of a Hong Kong guy and I''ve been here for longer. I love that. That''s so funny. I guess. That''s the main reason. I think in general, definitely, we can''t close our eyes and we have to admit that, you know, Singapore now has the bigger conferences. They have, you know, a lot of the big VCs, you know, they might have even moved their headquarter to Singapore or they decide to set up in Singapore. We lost a few big crypto companies to Singapore from Hong Kong. Yes, we definitely did. There was, you know, obviously also crypto uncertainty, you know, a few years back, etc. That also cost a few people to, you know, move to Singapore. So, overall, you know, there''s definitely at this stage, I think in terms of access of capital, Hong Kong has a lot of, you know, their family offices and there''s a lot of money in Hong Kong. I think people are generally, you know, very eager to invest into crypto from, you know, normal people on the street. Too eager. Too eager we''ve seen. So, Singapore is in a way also similar, but they just have like a lot more of the sort of international investors right now. I think the big shift right now is Dubai, right? Dubai is even more regulatory friendly. Like a lot of the exchanges obviously setting up in Dubai. But it''s also a great place for, you know, builders set up. So, a lot of the, you know, I would say slightly smaller, more innovative company startups, they might go to Dubai. Yeah. Just because, you know, it is set up to be more friendly for, I would say, high growth companies. Okay. Early stage companies, startups. Right. So, I think we are definitely losing out a little bit on that. They don''t have that, you know, talent pool in finance, etc. But as Jackie mentioned, people are quite, people move quite quickly, right? So, there''s definitely a little bit of a shift. Interesting. Towards Dubai. Yeah. Yeah. Sarah wants to jump back in. So, I have also other things to share about Hong Kong, which I think is the most amazing things even compared to the world. Okay. Like the women in Hong Kong are super strong and powerful. Okay. And so willing to support other women as well. Right. So, I mean, I just had breakfast with Evelyn, Citibank CEO. Like, she was so willing to meet up with us. And then before she went to the airport. But, and then also champion us, like within Citibank as well as like in the whole ecosystem. But not just her. Yeah. There was so many other like really amazing women in Hong Kong that are so supportive. And then they''re really like helping for the business. Yeah. And then also champion. So, I think we were having chat with a friend from the U.S. Like in the U.S., like a woman helping woman are considered to be a really risky thing. Like women don''t do that. You know? And then, but here in Hong Kong, no. Like I think, I think Hong Kong women must have done something right. They also must have done something right to educate the men in Hong Kong. It''s just amazing place. I think that there''s a lot of women in the audience. I think that, a little bit of a round of applause. If we were in the U.S., there''d be a huge like cheer for that. Yeah. That''s great, Sarah. But I think that makes a whole difference. And then like all the banks. Especially in this industry, right? In this industry, like SFC CEO is a woman. Like all the major banks, bank CEO, whether Citibank, Sancho Bank, they''re all women. And then so they are so willing to support women in business. So I think that''s a really good thing about Hong Kong. That''s great. I just walked past, on the way here, I walked past another panel. They asked the same question, Hong Kong and Singapore. The last guy said, Hong Kong for sure. And they''re like, why? Because there''s so many gamblers here. So I thought that was quite funny. So that''s a great, great thing. Okay. We have time for one quick last question. I think one of the things that we have to touch upon is what is your China play, right? This is going to be the big thing. Or do you have a U.S. play? I think that Hong Kong, as it is like seen as the connector to China. And we know there''s a lot of, you know, question marks about crypto market in China. But maybe, Jackie, let''s talk about do you have a China play? Is that important to you? Is that a benefit to doing your startup in Hong Kong? I think for China, it''s really about regulators stuff, right? Because like they banned the crypto three or four years before. And so all the builders or all the talents in crypto has like moved out from China. So I think really for the China play, I think it''s really we need to wait for the regulators to like start to like be more supportive to the crypto before we can really do anything. And for the U.S., I think we definitely see a lot of opportunities coming out. Opportunities. Yeah, because like every day they''re going to have like new things. Like one of them is like adding bitcoins as the reserve in the government, right? So this should be a huge way if it really happens. And then I think much more opportunities like things around that concept will rise afterwards. Interesting. I think that''s a good point. The Americans are doing a lot of stuff, which I think might influence China as well along the way. We''ll see. Sarah, what do you think? China play, U.S. play? Well, so we''re doing some work with Bank of China. It hasn''t announced. But I think if like a major bank in China, represent China, will be able to do something like all the other Chinese banks would follow. So I think that''s something to be seen. It hasn''t really announced. But I think that''s one. They will have to always get approval from the headquarter. So that will signal whether the activities that the Hong Kong government has been promoting in Hong Kong really get recognitions, you know, also by China. But representing by banks in Hong Kong. And not just one bank, but multiple banks in China. And then I think I saw I think some of the posting from the government official. I think right now to get maybe the PR or some investments. They are now recognizing your assets to include digital currency. I don''t think they can invest in digital currency yet. But like for your consider to be how much networks you can consider the Bitcoin. So I think I think that''s also one of the things where you kind of seeing. And then they''re catering to people with Chinese citizens. Right. So they kind of like officially kind of recognize that as well. So. So, yeah. So I think China Chinese companies Hong Kongese company are definitely huge for what DACC like digital is a clean company that we''re currently working with. Yeah. And we definitely wanted to get the largest one to come in and support. I mean, as the signal for the market. But yes. So it''s huge. I don''t think you can have a Hong Kong Web3 ecosystem without Chinese financial institutions. So and then we work with the largest asset manager called E-Fund as well for tokenized money market fund. So definitely like Chinese institutions where we collaborate the most. And I think and that''s where you would see more and more recognition of, OK, in Hong Kong, like you say, one country, two systems. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. So you will be able to see, OK, Chinese financial institutions in Hong Kong, they are able to meet the regulations in Hong Kong. They were able to do activities regularly and compliantly meeting with Hong Kong jurisdictions. So I think that''s definitely something we''re working on. OK. Jacob, quickly to you. China play, U.S. play. Yeah. I think I echo Jackie for the China play. We''ve got to wait for regulation. I think a lot of the Chinese, which have been leading figures in this space, they moved abroad. And then there''s a lot of institutions which are, I guess, led by Chinese, but they''re like abroad. And they definitely greatly contribute to the ecosystem. I think for the U.S., it''s very interesting. I was just in New York last week at the OnDo Summit. OK. It was one of the major sort of like RWA tokenization summits. And I have to say that the energy was very, very good, very amazing. Big contrast to the market. Everyone seems very excited. Everyone seems like now is the time that things might really change. Right. So far for DeFi, everyone has been avoiding the U.S. Yeah. Right. And now we shall see. Right. I think the hopes are very high. We shall see whether, you know, something actually happens. Yeah. But overall, I think everyone right now is looking at the U.S. And obviously the U.S. is the largest, greatest market in the world. So everyone has to have a China play. Sorry, a U.S. play at this point. And then getting prepared for that. Yeah. Great. Excellent.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('global_regulation_panel', 'Global Regulation Panel', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' Music Alright guys, thanks for being here. Thank you guys for being here. We''re really excited to be talking to Matt White and Eric Yip for our first ever consensus in Hong Kong. So I want to start with you because I know that your boss, Julia, just announced the new roadmap for crypto regulation in Hong Kong. And I''m hoping you could expand and tell everybody a little bit more about it. Sure, thank you. I''m very glad to be here. And welcome to Hong Kong, Shiyan and Matthew. We talked about the roadmap, I think, in the main stage. I didn''t get the chance to hear the rest of it, so I just presume that I''m going to carry over. So what will happen is that, I mean, we have been thinking about developing a roadmap for virtual asset development in Hong Kong for a while. And we just have to pick a date. And I don''t think we can pick a better date than today. I went with a very good crowd here, biggest virtual asset conference in Hong Kong this year for sure. And it will be released this afternoon. So I think the concept of the roadmap is that I think if you look back at Hong Kong for the last kind of eight years or so in terms of our virtual asset journey, is that, I mean, we have been very much focused on licensing. I mean, licensing platforms, licensing fund managers, licensing other service providers, et cetera. And I think we actually come to a critical mass. Now, I think as of today, we have 10 virtual asset trading platforms. I think we still can focus on licensing, but I think it''s more important to think about how to make our trading platform works. And I think the question is what is meant by working. And I think from myself bringing up from a traditional finance securities market perspective, I think the one word that we need to think about always is liquidity. How do you bring liquidity to this market? Hence, commercial value, hence ecosystem, et cetera. So liquidity is key. So I think when we designed a roadmap, we actually center around the concept of liquidity. And we are going to cover five pillars. And we kind of play around with the word ASPIRE. A-S-P-I-R-E. I mean, there are six letters. I will explain a bit why it''s six letters, just because it''s cool. So A is talking about assets. How to actually bring the right players, right liquidity providers to the market. Assess. The second is about safeguards. Safeguards is about what kind of compliance requirement as a regulator we can adapt to this market world. So safeguards. The third is about products. What kind of products we can offer to the investors. And the fourth one is about infrastructure. How do we build market-wide infrastructure for surveillance, for transparency, et cetera. And the last one is about, well, RE. Just because I think I need to make a word out of it. It''s relationships. And this is where we are here for. It''s about relationships. And relationships is not just about kind of me and my regulators, but also about, I mean, this kind of whole crowd here. About investors, about service providers, about our peer regulators. I mean, many, many people involved in the industry. Maybe I''ll just stop here. Oh, but I want to hear more. Okay. What comes next? What does it go into effect? What''s actually coming? I think what comes next is that, I mean, it is actually easier to grant a license. It''s actually not that difficult to write a roadmap. Now, the thing is that how do we actually execute the roadmap? And I think the first question people will ask me is that whether there''s a timetable for the roadmap. And the way that I would approach this is that this is a roadmap, not just for one road. I mean, we actually include out of that five pillars, 12 roads, 12 initiatives. And I intentionally didn''t bring in a timetable for each road because I think that requires us and our stakeholders, our regulators, our ecosystem partners, to really think about what kind of transportation you want to use on the road. I mean, if it is something that requires like a high speed train, you have to dig the tunnel, you have to pave the well. That takes some longer time. But this will be a kind of consulted decision. But if it is just really across the street, why don''t we just walk there? We don''t actually need to bring things that is really kind of very sophisticated in order to just walk across the street. So I think out of the 12 initiatives, I mean, we actually held the inaugural consultative panel, which actually comprised all of our licensed virtual asset trading platform management, to really kind of give us an idea, are these the right roads that you want to build? And then we, the next thing we have to think about what kind of transportation we want to build. I think the goal is that in any case, I mean, it won''t be a very, very long journey. I think the market is moving fast. And I think we actually as regulators also need to be fast. So we need to prioritize and find the low hand fruits so that we can let the market kind of see visible results, at least, I mean, across the five pillars in this year. Awesome. Is that enough? Yeah, I think so. Okay, thank you. All right, Matt, what''s happening at the UAE? Well, look, yeah, thank you. Look, first of all, I wanted to just briefly congratulate Eric and the SFC on the roadmap. It''s the first time hearing about it today. But as somebody who, you know, I strongly believe in the potential of the technology. It''s really exciting to hear, you know, major jurisdictions taking this seriously. And I think Hong Kong in particular shares a very similar vision to our leaders in Dubai, which has driven Vara over the last few years. We''re continuing to refine our framework. We have the benefit of some time where we''ve been able to observe market behavior and how participants are operating and what they need. And we have a fairly ambitious regulatory plan for 2025 as well. And a lot of that will happen in Q1. I''ll touch on that here, perhaps. So the reason we''re doing it essentially is strengthen the baseline that we have already, but also to sort of enable and enable market participants like institutions to be able to operate a lot more seamlessly in the market. And so we''ve got three major buckets of what we''re looking at at the moment. Number one are, you know, specific enhancements for institutions, both to be regulated and to be able to operate in the market. So we are about to introduce models for things like off exchange settlement, collateral optimization. We have some derivatives and margin trading frameworks about to about to launch. And also this concept of real world asset tokenization is becoming really, really important. And that''s not just one thing, but it is an area that we''re looking at introducing components of frameworks to as well. So that''s the institutional piece. And they need that infrastructure and they need those products. The next bucket is broadly speaking, again, around DeFi and a DeFi framework. So for me, this is like a, you know, a sort of new frontier of accessible finance, if you like. But it doesn''t, you know, it doesn''t come easily. There are some challenges we need to overcome. So we''re looking at pilots for decentralized exchanges and automated market maker models. We''re taking a look at staking and liquid staking. Staking is already enabled to a certain extent in the market, but liquid staking isn''t. And so we''re looking at how that plays out as well. And the last area of that is around lending and borrowing. So vaults in particular is something that we''re interested in and looking at doing pilots in this year. So that''s number two. The third bucket is a refresh of our sort of issuance framework, reflecting the fact that, you know, the issuance of tokens is becoming more and more important, particularly, as I''ve just mentioned, with real world assets tokenization as well. So we''re very much focused on the activity side of it. So, you know, placement, distribution, secondary trading. And we''re looking at that from a strict disclosure standpoint, but also how do we implement other sort of investor protection measures around that, particularly when it comes to reserves. So they''re the three buckets is a pretty ambitious plan building on what we''ve already got. A lot of that will be introduced in Q1. One of the other really important things that we''re looking to do in 2025 as well is, frankly, deepen collaboration with international regulators. And I''m very grateful for the invite to be able to speak in Hong Kong. And we see this as a jurisdiction that we, you know, we can really work together with. And so that will certainly be on the agenda this year as well, just to make sure we''ve got the right information and knowledge sharing across borders. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah, it''s great. You know, all this talk about regulation and regulatory frameworks and all the good work you guys are doing kind of brings to mind the U.S., which does not really have a crypto regulatory framework. But we have a new president. And with that has come, you know, a change, a big change in tone, if not necessarily in substance yet about how crypto will be regulated in the U.S. And I think that as somebody who covers the U.S. crypto market and U.S. crypto regulation, I have to wonder, you know, if the U.S. really does get its stuff together and U.S. regulators become more friendly to crypto innovation in the U.S., what does that mean for jurisdictions like Hong Kong, like the UAE that have become kind of known for being ahead of the curve? Should I start first? Yeah, sure. Well, I was brought up in the U.S. and I have great admiration of what I think how deep and how wide the U.S. financial industry has been and also innovation. So I think the first thing actually I would do this year as there is already kind of I''m a candidate as I talk about before the chat here is that I would be going to the U.S. I think this year and hopefully I think will be appear in the same conference as Trump to really kind of understand. I mean, his frame of mind. I mean, obviously, U.S. is actually very important in the sense that because they drive a lot of innovation and also because of a lot of commonality with Hong Kong in the sense of financial intermediaries. I think at the end of the day, I think one when we actually draw the roadmap, I think one conviction I think we have to make is that there will be despite of all the geopolitics or whatever people talk about, there will be a certain set of kind of cohesiveness on the regulatory side and also convergence between the traditional finance and the federal asset world. And we already see that kind of getting into the directions and in the sense that with a major financial market like U.S. being coming on board that will only help actually bring that cohesiveness and convergence to happen. And at the same time, which I think in Hong Kong we like is to have a bit of competition so that I think we all push each other kind of stronger and kind of move things faster. And I definitely also look upon to Vara, I think under the leadership of Matthew that I mean, things the topics that he just talked about, to be honest, is like very, very well ahead of us in the sense that I think already when we are talking about staking, you''re already thinking about restaking and liquid staking. So in fact, I think before actually going to US, in our breakfast meeting this morning, I think we can disclose that, is that because I feel kind of pushed by Matthew, I already see him two times in Hong Kong, but I haven''t been to Dubai. And it seems like that actually it will be an occasion where I can visit Matthew and also Dubai to understand also that kind of cross-border collaboration. How I mean between Vara and Hong Kong, SFC, we can actually work closely together. So a lot of this actually is happening because I think the big players are kind of coming on board. So it''s win-win. Nobody loses. Yes. Maybe at the end of the day someone loses, but it''s still actually winning. Okay. Matt, what do you think? Yeah, look. Eric, you''re very kind, by the way. Look, I tend to agree. I think net-net is a positive. Frankly speaking, the industry needs global regulatory clarity. You can''t achieve that without the US. And I''m pretty optimistic about sort of the opportunities for us to be able to collaborate on a regulatory agenda. And also a kind of innovation agenda as well. I''ll keep it short. I''ll keep it short. But, you know, I''m not seeing people gravitating away from the market, sort of, you know, back to the US as such. I think it will be both. In actual fact, I was speaking to a couple of major institutions in the last couple of weeks, and they''re looking to replicate what they''ve got in the US elsewhere, possibly in Dubai. So I really don''t think it''s either or. I think it will be both. I think it''s important to have the organizations that they''ve got there are big enough. But overall, it''s important that we have that global regulatory clarity. And I think that''s what we''ll get. So do you have any advice for your American counterparts as they begin thinking about the stuff that you guys started thinking about a long time ago? I would not presume to know what''s best for the US. What I can tell you is what we''ve learned so far. Two or three really important things. Number one, by far and away, the most important is engagement with industry. Something that we''ve really benefited from in Dubai is that ongoing dialogue with industry participants and, you know, getting some very frank feedback on frameworks and business models and what''s working and what''s not. It also allows us to be a bit more agile as a regulator. So this space moves extremely quickly, as you all know. And for us to be able to, you know, we''ll never be ahead of the curve. But, you know, for us to be as close to that curve as possible, we need that industry dialogue. And so that would be one area. And I think the other two, which I''ll touch on very quickly, and then maybe Eric wants to add, interoperability at the outset is really, really important. I think you can''t do this in isolation. And if you''re trying to do this without looking cross-border or at least considering cross-border risks, I think you''ve got a problem. And then the last one is really that we''ve looked at this strictly as an activity-based piece. We''ve not tried to regulate product. And I think that has served us quite well so far. We haven''t got drawn into the kind of minutiae debates about whether something''s a meme coin or an NFT or whatever it might be. So they''d probably be the three lessons learned from our side. So I think Matthew touched on very tangible, kind of more the sub-dramatic perspective. I would try to touch on more the intangible. I started to learn about this space last year since I joined the commission in May. I have kind of two intangibles that I keep on having in my mind. The one is about humility. Because, I mean, the digital assets is a kind of destructive technology. It''s a destructive kind of asset class. But I think what makes it work, I think, for the last decade or so is that it''s actually filled by very, very brilliant minds and talents. And they are young. They are hungry. They are innovative. And I think they are actually very technically sound. So although, I mean, there are ups and downs here. But I think this, the one conviction I have for this market, why it will work, is because it''s driven by people who are talented. So I think as a regulator, I mean, for us and for America, for VARA, for other jurisdictions, we have to actually listen to the market, understand the market. This is one thing. The other intangible is that, I mean, if you actually look back at the history, history will repeat itself, always. And it is an intrinsically dangerous market. I mean, when, and again, that''s where traditional finance may help because we actually have been through cycles after cycles. And there are players, actually, if you look back for the last 10 years, 10 years is not a big, long time for asset class. And you already see up and down where actually there is financial harms, that investors are being kind of ripped off. There are also companies that fail. So it will happen. And if we actually do not have that diligence, if we do not have that focus in mind, I think at the end of the day, we may actually destroy the marketplace. We should actually survive in the long term. Interesting. Yeah. I like that it''s sort of a respect and curiosity rather than a fear-based approach to regulation. So, all right. We''ll move away from the US. This is a global regulation panel. And something I want to ask you guys about is just big picture, where do you see global crypto regulation going? Because right now, things are still pretty fragmented. I know you''ve both touched on international collaboration. But, you know, what do you think is going to happen? Want me to go? Sure. Look, there is some fragmentation, of course. I think that is pretty natural, given the kind of state of maturity of the technology and regulatory framework. So I don''t think that''s a concern at this point. It''s actually not that dissimilar from traditional finance in some respects, although there are significant areas where coordination around things like AML, you know, exists at the moment. I think, in the end, that''s where it needs to head. And, you know, I suppose there''s a couple of areas like the travel rule where we could quite easily see some harmonization, some clarity for participants about how that works in different jurisdictions. My own view is that I think we''ll be forced into this eventually. The technology, the use cases will just become so pervasive so quickly that, you know, as a global kind of regulatory framework, it will need to exist. You know, stable coins is a really good example of where, you know, I think that will drive the agenda, naturally drive the agenda. So, yeah, it''s fragmented. I think that, you know, naturally over time we will gravitate towards more harmonization in certain areas. Do you think regional harmonization will come before global? Like, will there be a Mika of the Middle East or Asia? You can try first. You can try first. Yeah. Sorry? I mean, Dubai and Hong Kong can try first. We can try. I think that''s a good idea, actually. Look, I don''t know. There''s clearly some divergence in the Middle East. You''ve got the UAE, which has been very clear and progressive around this. You have Saudi and Qatar, which have taken more of a financial infrastructure look at this. And then you have Egypt, who is a complete prohibition on virtual assets. So I think naturally, again, you know, in, say, the next five to ten years, everyone will have some sort of exposure to it. You know, the extent to which they need that exposure. I don''t know. But, again, I think we''ll be forced into that eventually. So maybe I''ll say a few words. Over the last kind of nine months I''ve been with the regulator, I have an observation. Is that, I mean, wherever I attend any regulatory conference, whenever I meet with any regulatory counterpart, be it in the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K., in the region, et cetera. That''s almost even in mainland China. There was no one occasion when this topic, the virtual asset, crypto, has not been talked about. Every time. No exception. Now, I think it comes back to the roadmap. What inspired me to do the roadmap is that I think there has been a lot of interest. There were a lot of kind of dialogue on the IOSCO level, on the regional level, on the bilateral level. All kind of discussion. I think one of my aspirations of kind of doing the roadmap is to put in a framework to think about it. That''s why I mean the five pillars. I mean, it''s a little bit of motherhood and apple pie, but at least I put in a framework. I think what is actually challenging, I think, so far is that we are introducing a lot of topics by many different people. I mean, but we do not have a common kind of framework articulation to talk about it. So it''s kind of our attempt to contribute to probably a more bilateral, more regional, more global dialogue by establishing a framework. And this framework may not be kind of the perfect one, but at least we have something in place. I mean, when we talk about staking, for example, this is a term that is undefined in traditional securities regulator mindset. And by putting that through the mouth of a securities regulator, we''ve got an opportunity when we talk about it, we can kind of define it better. Because at the end of the day, you can''t really go from concept to regulation like overnight. You have to actually go through a thinking process, how to actually break it down into component, how to kind of put the traditional legal compliance framework and kind of govern that. That is going to be a pretty technical process. And hopefully we are getting there in terms of having a common language taxonomy to move things forward. So that''s kind of a bit of an aspiration and inspiration for the roadmap. Yeah, it''s exciting. All right, Matt, you said it first, stablecoins. So I''m going to pick on you. What''s going on with stablecoin regulation in the UAE? And, you know, what would a global stablecoin regulatory framework look like in a perfect world? So I wrote about this quite recently, actually. Stablecoins have been around for a while. Frankly, they will revolutionize the global financial system, in my opinion, eventually. They''re going to disrupt payment networks. You know, you''ve got types of stablecoins that enable you to generate yield and that is challenging risk-free rates as a result. And, you know, you''re expanding access to U.S. dollars to areas that, you know, haven''t really got access to that kind of stability in currency. So, you know, look, it is quite important to regulate that appropriately. The UAE does have frameworks around this already. And taking it quite seriously, albeit cautiously. There are some straightforward projects around fiat-backed stablecoins that will probably come to market first. And there are some more complex projects for stablecoins that are not fiat-backed but also stable in nature. So tokenized money market funds would be a good example. And it''s really important to regulate those properly. I think, you know, there are some significant risks around that. Reserves is a really interesting one. You''d be forgiven for thinking that backing a stablecoin entirely in cash is a good idea. But it''s probably not, given the credit risk that you''re exposing that to in a banking environment. So we''re looking at topics like that in terms of how we would license something like that to, you know, to protect the market as best we can. As for what a global framework would look like, I don''t know. That''s fair. No one knows. I think everyone''s going to have a go at it first. And we''ll probably end up with some sort of FX stablecoin exchange somewhere. But, yeah, I don''t know what a global framework would look like that. So maybe I''ll just pick up from what Matthew just said. I think the one word that I agree the most is that regulated. It has to be regulated. I think my career is actually going through that route. U.S. I think is way and see how that goes. In Hong Kong, definitely we are going through a regulated route. I think in the sense that I think why actually we need stablecoin, for example. I mean, we have Bitcoin, we have other kind of digital currencies. But why do we need stablecoin? Because actually this is one kind of constant in the market which facilitate a lot of the benefit from the blockchain. For example, autonomous settlement and also kind of the fungibility across the system. So that is very fundamental to the whole virtual asset ecosystem. Now, if we talk about edges and the fiat reference stablecoin, for instance, it is in a way fungible. Because at the end of the day, a U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar reference stablecoin should be the same. Whether it''s wrapped like this or that. And that''s actually, I think, at the end of the day, what investors, what the ecosystem actually look for is probably security and certain type of safety feature built into it. That''s why where the regulation should come in. So now I think it''s still evolving. But again, with EU, Hong Kong, et cetera, I mean, the stablecoin in Hong Kong is regulated by Hong Kong Monetary Authority. And already the legislation is very, very advanced that we are actually going to put in a regulatory framework for regulating stablecoin. And by following that logic, it means that going, I think, in time, only regulated stablecoin will be allowed. I think at least in this jurisdiction. Now, once we have that in place, I think what would be interesting to see is not just the stablecoin per se, and how actually stablecoin can interact with the rest of the regulated ecosystem. And I think that''s where SFC come into place. Because it actually will operate kind of the investment product landscape, the trading platform landscape. And I think we need to work with a fellow regulator, Hong Kong MA, to create use cases to make the stablecoin kind of use and have fair proposition in the virtual asset trading perspective. So I think that''s kind of where we are going in Hong Kong. I was going to ask you guys about memecoins, the opposite of stablecoins, but I think you''re saved by the bell. So, oh, yeah. But something I do want to ask you about. Yeah, unless you want to take 10 seconds, how do we regulate memecoins? Well, I don''t know. Yeah, well, no one does. So, all right, I guess we''ll close with this. If we''re on the same stage in a year, things move really fast in crypto. What will we be talking about then? I think we were talking about, I mean, if I''m on the stage, I think people will hold me accountable. I mean, despite, I mean, I''m saying there''s no timetable. Hold me accountable for how much progress I''ve made on the roadmap. So I think that''s something I have in mind as my kind of KPIs here. Yeah, I think we''ll see some greater policy clarity, hopefully some strong relationships between jurisdictions. Probably some more non-financial use cases. We talk a lot about financial use cases here, but stuff like AI and crypto intersections or decentralized research and development. I think we''ll probably see a bit more of that. We''re starting to see that creeping up at the moment. So I suspect we''ll be talking about those things. That sounds interesting. So you guys all have to come back in a year so we can talk about that. All right. Well, thank you guys so much for being here and thank you guys for listening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Great. Yeah.', 'Music Alright guys, thanks for being here.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('fighting_for_digital_property_rights', 'Fighting for Digital Property Rights', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' Music Alright, the one and only Yetsu everybody. So the title of this panel is Fighting for Digital Property Rights. And I gotta say, sometimes it really does feel like a fight. One of the things that I love about you Yat is you are an eternal optimist. I feel like you''re a guiding light, like this beacon of hope for our industry. We all look to you to find some kind of inspiration. Like when it feels like all this shit is going down, like where do we go from here? And before we dive into our real chat, which was really about an update on your thesis for the Open Metaverse, can we just address the giant, giant elephant in the room which you''ve been tweeting about, Libra. So, do you want to give us a bit of an update? You posted on Twitter, or X I should say, about what''s got down there. And what I really liked about this post was that you gave us, I think, five really clear points in terms of what needs to happen to clean up this industry. But give us the context and how you got involved with this whole thing. Well, so thank you. It''s great to be here. And I think it''s just wonderful to see consensus here in Hong Kong. Yes. I live in Hong Kong. I love Hong Kong. So, great to see that. Yeah. So, that''s kind of the first point. I would say, you know, for those of you who are not familiar, you know, obviously there was this whole scandal about how the president of Argentina is apparently implicated in the launch of a token called Libra. But really, the revelation in an interview with CoffeeZilla and Hayden, basically, of the market maker, was all of the type of sort of insider dealings and so on that took place. And, of course, one can take it in the meme coin space. And, you know, what I was upset about was the fact that we''ve come so far from where we were. We have institutional adoption for Web3, blockchain, crypto, tokens. There''s a broader understanding what it means to be for tokenizations and RWAs. And then you have this kind of shit going on, right? Yeah. However, you know, so to me, though, it''s a lesson, right? Which means that people need to understand when you do meme coins, understand that this is not a fair game that is completely rigged and that you have to be mindful of what you''re doing. The second thing, of course, is that you need to look for projects that have real builders looking to do real things. One of the, in fact, you could argue that the last year was tough for industry, not because of what happened recently, but because much of the liquidity for serious builders was sucked into meme coins that were really just for speculation as opposed to for something that was building real value. And again, I have nothing against meme coins. They do build community and it can be fun. But, you know, clearly what''s been going on was no longer fun. It was absolute sort of sort of really, really scam, right? Right. And but but what''s positive is that when you take a look at the ICO phase in 2017, 2018, a lot of people exited from crypto broadly. Right. And when you looked at FTX, right, this was not that long ago. Right. And Terra Luna, you know, we had like, you know, eight to ten billions, like billions of dollars of liquidations and the market tanked. Yeah. But now, starting with Trump, which was really a vampire attack on altcoins, Melania and then Libra and the tariffs. We''ve had basically over ten billion dollars of liquidations and Bitcoin is still close to 100K. Right. So that tells to that to me is a max bullish sign. It''s it means that we have sort of reached a certain kind of resilience or these type of so-called systemic shocks that would have set our industry back years, five years ago, actually kind of don''t really matter in the bigger scheme of things. The other thing, which is also one thing, is that the people who generally got hurt, which is unfortunate. And of course, you don''t want to wish this on anyone, is that they were mostly people who are already in the inside scheme, meaning they were the crypto bros. Right. And so in one hand, you know, so broad retail didn''t get hurt. People outside the ecosystem, unlike Terra Luna or FTX, innocent people who didn''t know what they were doing didn''t get hurt. So it''s a slightly different tinge to this. But but I think the bright side is, of course, focus on the real projects that are out there. Market proof to be resilient. And and all of us can now actually focus on the real stuff. So so I''m positive about it. Yeah, just before we move on from that, I''d love to really understand how you reconcile that, because you''ve always been such an advocate for community and culture on chain. And I think advocates for mean coins would say that they''re a fantastic representation of that. But now we really are seeing it go down a challenging path where you''re saying that the game isn''t fair and there''s a lot at risk. Yeah, seeing these so that actors come into the space like the understanding of the meme coin narrative was around the so-called fair launch. Yeah. And in the beginning, the fair launch made sense. You could also argue, by the way, that Bitcoin is the genesis of the fair launch. Right. You''re basically mining with your computer or your PC and you get a certain amount of Bitcoin when you do that. Everyone does it at the same time on day one. That''s basically how you create the rules of the game. Yeah. And what''s powerful about blockchain and why digital property rights work so well there is that there are certain aspects of the rule of the rules of the game that are all the way. The rules of the game that are on chain. Now, why does Hong Kong work as an economy so well and is amongst the top GDPs? Because the rules of the game are set. You can''t steal. You can do businesses in a way that your tax rate is certain. You know, it may be a little boring, a little bit bureaucratic, but you have certainty. Right. And that certainty means that we''re all playing across the same rules of the game. And the power of blockchain is that I can transact with you or anyone in this room without knowing who you are. But the rules of the game are the same. If I give you a Bitcoin, it''s your Bitcoin. I can''t just take it away, for instance. Right. Or there''s something in a smart contract. What is a smart contract? A smart contract is essentially the establishment of the rules of a game of engagement, whether it''s for NFTs or games, that doesn''t matter. Right. What happened here is no different than FTX. The rules of the game were not transparent. FTX, straight theft. But here it was basically people sniping, not telling people what they were doing, creating an illusion of safety and an illusion of fairness that was always a lie. Right. And that is the part that we can fix with blockchain. So that means meme coins aren''t dead. It just means new platforms will emerge that will give you the certainty of that transparency and they will come back in a new and better way. And we kind of have to go through these cycles to say to do that. And it''s unfortunate. But also now, because of regulation coming in, basically, you''re going to say this is what you can do and this is what you can''t do. And, you know, I''m a big believer that the justice in this area will be swift and fast because this is so open and so blatant that I don''t think the parties involved are going to get away with it. And that''s the other thing. You know, my previous thesis was because of FTX, crime would be harder because it''s out in the open and the sense of what happens to you. Right. You know, nobody''s going to do what SPF did. Now you have a different type of crime. But after that, I don''t think it''s going to happen that way anymore because, you know, everyone''s going to realize that''s bad. And the consequences need to be dire enough for you never to do that again. Got it. So talking about cycles, you recently published an essay, also an opinion piece on Cointelegraph, I think. And it was about an update to the TED talk that you did in 2022, right? 2023. Yeah, right. April. Thank you. Yeah. And it was around your thesis for the Open Metaverse. But when I was reading it, I got this sense that you had maybe enjoyed some scrutiny around that. Oh, absolutely. Yeah. And I kind of feel that that was really painful for you. But reading this update, it sounded like you were more bullish than ever. So can you explain just what''s happened over that period? And what do you think is the state of digital property rights now? Yeah. So when I gave the talk at TED in 23, you have to remember, FTX happened in November of 22. Yeah. You know, Bitcoin was like down to like 15, 16K. It was bad. I saw you in Manila in November when it just happened. Yeah. Yeah. It was pretty nasty. I was the only guy on TED stage talking about crypto. And, you know, everyone else was talking about AI, right? That guy. I was that guy. And most people in the room didn''t understand what the metaverse was because in their mind, metaverse was meta, as in 50. Yeah. So there was that clarification as well. And the reason why I wrote this article was really as a way, not just for vindication and validation, but also to indicate when I gave that talk, what happened? So in 23, you know, DAOs, Decentralized Autonomous Organization, had about $12 billion of value, which already was quite big back then. And the entire ecosystem was maybe one and a half, maybe less, a little less than one and a half trillion dollars in size, for instance. Mm-hmm. And then when I wrote after that, you know, we''re now at over $3 trillion, right? DAOs have like $20 to $30 billion of value locked in them that are governed. And this is the other thing. They''re governed. You know, back in 23, it was about 3 million people that ended up governing, you know, these DAOs. Today, it''s 11 million people. Wow. So you have basically, you know, three. And like, work just happened throughout a band market as well. Exactly. Exactly. Now you have three times the number of people who can have control over $20 to $30 billion of assets, just naming any kind of ecosystem in the world, private, public, whatever, where you can do that. I mean, we can vote on things in government, like Switzerland, you can vote in your canton, sure, but not at that scale and not with that type of freedom and not with that type of, I guess, libertarian ideals, right? So that''s really empowering, right? And I wanted people to know that because, you know, now, especially in the advent of institutional era of crypto, where you have, you know, Bitcoin ETFs, Ethereum ETFs, BlackRock, you know, Fidelity, all those guys coming into the space as well, you know, where have we come and where will we go? And to me, why this is so bullish is because we''ve gone through such a really tough winter, right, over many cycles, and yet we''re stronger and bigger than ever. And this comes down to the last point I was making, which is that, you know, we had this issue with, you know, the Argentine president''s sort of implicated token, but at the end of the day, we are still here and we''re stronger than ever. I mean, you look at the energy in the conference, you know, it''s not like... It''s really vibrant. Yeah. I mean, I remember when we were in some of the sort of those days, it was crickets in the room, okay? It was like, you know, like five people in an empty hall type of thing. And now we don''t have that. So again, there''s resiliency. And that means that when you take a... You know, when you just compare it from one month to the other, it might look bad. But when you macro out, actually, the longer you zoom out, the more optimistic it gets. And that''s basically the lens we''ve always taken. We''ve taken that macro perspective. More people care about that. They want to have digital sovereignty. They care about owning the assets. They''re starting to understand quantitative easing. When that came out, people didn''t realize the impact of inflation. Everyone feels the impact of inflation today. Everyone wants to find a way in which they can protect their assets. And now the next level of digital property rights is around defining what is the value of it. And this is where we come to things like the network theory around basically network effects. And again, that''s the next level. So we started talking about sort of, you know, what is the network effect and why is that valuable? How can you define sort of something that seems sort of something you can''t capture? But that''s what intellectual property is. Imagine what the music industry would be like if we didn''t have IP rights. No Michael Jackson, no Beatles, no Taylor Swift. It wouldn''t be possible. Because everyone would just be taking music and stealing and doing that kind of stuff because you can''t protect your work. IP rights is the original virtual property rights. It''s not digital. It''s legal. But it''s a virtual property right. It''s not a house. It''s not something physical. It''s something virtual that you created with your imagination and with your ingenuity. And it had to be protected. Blockchain scales that. That means even if I have something that has, you know, makes $10 a year, but it''s an intellectual property right, it becomes a capital asset as an NFT. I don''t have to hire a lawyer to make it protected. I can make an NFT out of it. So companies are protecting, individuals are protecting their dance moves or their educational content as a way to prove that I was the inventor of that. So it just opens up all sorts of creative endeavors around property rights. Let me push back a little bit. As I said, I love that you are the eternal optimist and always see, you know, the guiding light forward. But I wrote an opinion piece recently for CoinDesk, which was about the fact that in the Blockchain Game Alliance annual survey and report, blockchain gaming professionals across the board said that the number one benefit that is brought to gaming is digital property rights. Ownership, that''s right. And yet, those same people were saying that a lot of them were obfuscating the Web3 elements from their games because it''s so difficult to onboard new users. A lot of them are kind of pushing back against it. You know, it''s a massive point of friction and other people just don''t really understand it. So they were kind of like making a lot of the Web3 elements optional or at least kind of fitting them in later down the track if players have to interact with them at all. And I was wondering what you think about that because I think everyone agrees with the thesis. They get it. Like property rights are incredibly important. It''s the basis of a prospering society. But it''s kind of hard to implement a lot of these technologies or actually get real users to take it on and care about it. So maybe if we go to a smaller community before we go into gaming and I''ll address that. And if you have NFT holders, whether it''s Pudgy Penguins, Mochaverse or Bored Apes, you know, those type of collections are the ones who truly appreciate property rights. These have market values, you know, and, you know, maybe they''re not billions, but hey, hundreds of millions, still pretty wild when you think about it, right? So from that context, you have these communities that value them and they respect it and they own it and they do stuff with it. But they''re smaller as a basis. They''re really much more closer to, you know, sort of Kevin Kelly''s vision of a thousand true fans. Those thousand true fans that you have that you build and you grow from. So what has been gaming''s challenge? Gaming''s challenge has been that it''s a Web 2 business model trying to fit into Web 3 as supposed to be natively Web 3. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So when you go natively Web 3, you start with the NFT. You start with a user that appreciates the property versus a Web 2 game that tries to obfuscate it, which works from an adoption standpoint. But you don''t get the same effect because they don''t really understand why they''re here. Right? And so here''s the thing. A Web 3 user''s ARPU is 30, 40, 50x than that of a Web 2 user. Because a Web 2 user in a freemium business model is mostly free. And then, you know, it''s a less than 2% conversion rate on average. It''s 1.5% as an industry average that converts into paying user. But a true Web 3 user is always a paying user. So that means if you have 100,000 Web 3 users, that''s the equivalent of millions and millions of Web 2 users. So there''s this aspect that you have to sort of contemplate that the business models and the thinking is at fault. Now, let''s look at where Web 3 gaming is. In December, it was about 6.6 million daily active players. Not bad at all. Okay? I mean, you know, like if you''re talking about it. So that''s one. Well, in terms of when you''re saying like how far we''ve come as well, the numbers are huge. I remember writing about Axie when it was 500 DAU. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. We invested in Axie when it, I think, reached 1,000 users or something. Yeah. And it was like, whoa! Exactly. And also we invested in OpenSea when it had the first million dollars of total sales. Yeah. Right? And now NFTs are doing close to a billion a month. Right? Yeah. So that''s kind of part of that evolution. But I think also the combined market cap in tokens for the gaming ecosystem is about 16 to 18 billion dollars. Right? So yeah, it''s not 300 billion or 200 billion that the industry size is. But from where it was before, it''s doing incredibly well. Now, I think there''s a little bit of this sort of user envy that some people in the industry have. They look at that and they say, oh, this game has 10 million users. I wish I had that too. But the industry doesn''t need 10 million users to be sustainable. Look at Axie Infinity. At the end of the day, hundreds of thousands of loyal active players create that because the economies in the Web3 game, the true economies, are much more like a nation. Right? And, you know, Axie and SkyMavis team often talks about the community as that of a nation, the Axie nation as they describe it. And that''s what you have. And now imagine you have a village or a city that has 200,000 people. In China, it''s a village. But in Europe, it''s a city. Right? So depending which perspective you take. Right? And you create economies where they trade their assets and they build new stuff. The beautiful thing about blockchain is its composability. Yeah. Which is why when you look at, for instance, the evolution of Axie Infinity is a Ronin blockchain. And the Ronin blockchain created a framework where others can build and compose on top of that and do that. And then you have distribution that was getting better last year with Ton. Right? We really backed the Ton ecosystem because this is close to a billion users that you can now address. But remember, Apple, Facebook, and Google, and Steam were actively blocking Web3 content. So this wasn''t just because the games in itself. It was the distribution vectors. Like today, if you launch an NFT-based game on Apple, you cannot have utility for the NFT. Exactly. Yeah. So this will go away eventually. Yeah. But this is a type of monopolistic practices that take place. That hurts the industry. Do you think it will really go away? What sort of timeline do you think before a- I think, well, first of all, we haven''t, you know, the narrative fit in the past because of what was going on in politics in the US. But now under pro-crypto administration in the US, right, if someone wants to come up, you know, on the same freedom-based principles. Remember, Epic couldn''t get their app back on the US App Store, but they could release payments. Right? So Apple basically had to give up their monopoly on payments on the App Store. And now this is where the next step comes in. All someone has to do is make a pretty articulated complaint. And eventually, I would imagine under this administration that, you know, if you''re still blocking NFTs, under certain antitrust and anti-monopolistic practices, I totally imagine that Apple might be forced to open up. Right? Just to make sure that you have essentially fair competitive practice. So I think that''s one area if they don''t just generally open up. But the other thing to bear in mind is Web3 and tokens generally have been really, I think of them as a kind of open poly market of an indicator of the world. I love that. So, you know, and this is actually why I like meme coins. Not the type of Libra, Trump coin type of stuff, but some of the early ones because they were indicators of where our attention was. Yeah. So, you know, I became really cool with my kids because I knew about Chill Guy. But I didn''t know about Chill Guy because I''m on TikTok. Yeah, yeah. I knew about Chill Guy because of the token, right? Yeah. And so this, you know, why is Trump token popular? Because it''s where the attention was at that moment in time. Some of that attention is five or ten minutes. Some of that attention is for months. Some of our attention is more eternal, you know, like other type of meme coins, for instance. And they give you an indication of where that market is. That is to say that our space has always been narrative driven from a token standpoint. Why have AI agents last year? Like, you know, John Jordan wrote this sort of lamenting piece, game tokens are down and AI agents are up. You know, he''s all pessimistic about it. But what has the… He''s pessimistic about a lot of things. Yeah, exactly. That''s why I love him. Yes, yes. But the broader industry has been talking about what for the last two years? AI. Yeah, yeah. Not even just Web3, just broadly, right? So it''s not a surprise that, of course, we''re pro-AI and we''re investing in this space, but agentic AI and AI themes have been rising, right? But gaming hasn''t been rising as a theme. Gaming post-COVID has been broadly flat. Yeah. User growth hasn''t been there. This year, we think we''re really bullish on gaming because there''s two major events that will drive it. GTA 6 and Nintendo Switch 2. How many people here know or have played GTA 6 or GTA 5, I mean, right? Yeah, okay, fine. How many people here believe they''re going to buy a new console just because they get to play GTA 6, right? Or have friends? Basically, you''re going to get a whole bunch of people that are basically just going to adopt and buy hardware. Yeah. And the Nintendo and GTA hasn''t had a new title in almost eight years. Switch hasn''t launched a new console in basically eight years. So this is going to be a big year. And so the narrative will come in, the attention will come in, and the funding will come in, and the whole space will sort of accelerate in growth as well. Having said that, Web3 Gaming, again, zoom out. Yeah. Take a look at where we were with NFTs and Web3 Gaming over the last sort of three to five years, and it''s basically just growth. And I think Web3 Gaming is what''s going to be driving gaming broadly, especially indie studios. Well, I love that so much because I think there''s been so much FUD about Web3 Gaming, but I completely agree with you. It''s still the most interesting area of the entire blockchain ecosystem for me. Now, unfortunately, I think they''re going to start playing the music and drag us off the stage. So we are at time. We''re going to have to wrap it here. Thank you, Yash. Thank you. The eternal optimist. The eternal optimist.', 'Music Alright, the one and only Yetsu everybody.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('fireside__auros', 'Fireside_ Auros', '未知講者', 'Fireside Chats', ' Music All right. Everyone, we''re here to talk about the biggest meme coin in the world, Trump. Well, not quite a meme coin. We actually are going to talk about Donald Trump. We''re going to be talking today about the 2024 election in the United States and its consequences on crypto. It''s a huge topic. And here discussed with me is a preeminent expert on all things macro, former TradFi and current Chief Commercial Officer at Oros. Jason, why don''t you give yourself a bit of a bio? Thanks, David. Hey, everyone. I''m the Chief Commercial Officer at Oros. We''re a global market maker, liquidity provider. You probably have traded against us at some point in the markets. We''re on the bid and the ask of all major centralized and decentralized venues, providing liquidity across all markets so that everyone can have a frictionless, cheap, and reasonable way to trade crypto and access the market. And that accessibility is really part of our mission, making sure that the world can trade crypto in a fair, equitable, ethical manner, providing liquidity in the best way possible. Speaking of liquidity, even the water here is called flow. So we''ve got everything going for us. All right. So let''s dig straight in. Last year around this time, the market was moving very much sideways. We didn''t see much movement until, well, it turns out pretty late in the year. Prediction markets, even as far as as soon as October, early October, predicting that Kamala Harris would win the presidency. And crypto markets were responding by once again trading sideways. But as it looked like Donald Trump was more likely to win, we started seeing Bitcoin price rise and with that the overall market increase. And then, of course, Trump did win in a relative landslide. And when that occurred, markets started screaming. First, from your perspective, then we''re going to dig into kind of the consequence of that. As a market maker, what were you seeing in terms of trades and flows, both with institutional and with retail? Yeah, so the view that we have on the market and the things that we work on allow us to see pretty early the sentiment shift. So we start we talk to a lot of projects. We talk to a lot of foundations. We talk to a lot of teams that are thinking about issuing tokens. And we started to see a real pickup in interest for people to reenter that area of the market that had been, as you point out, trading sideways. So if Bitcoin is a barometer of overall market sentiment, as that started to rise, you also started to see founders start to reengage with the exchanges. They started reaching out to us to talk to our exchange partners and understand the listing process again. And it was something that we hadn''t seen through most of the middle part of last year. There was obviously that spike up at the start of the year. But ultimately, the market had been caught in this. Well, we have the ETF now and what''s next? And with Kamala Harris potentially winning the US presidential election, there wasn''t a lot of optimism and not a lot of reason to engage. So really, when we started to see market shift and we''ve seen this before, even during the first Trump presidency, as soon as it starts to look like he was going to win, things change very, very quickly. And we saw that firsthand. What we also observed was how quickly liquidity was starting to get eaten up. And it really pointed to the fact that as markets have grown and institutional adoption has started, liquidity has become even more important. And if you understand that liquidity sits as the lifeblood of all of the industry and allows people to trade and different participants to trade in different sizes. Well, we''ve certainly seen enormous flows in since since Trump was elected. And this is even before he was actually instantiated in office, which, of course, occurred in January. But the Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January of 24. We saw some early successes. BlackRock and the others were saying that this was kind of the most successful ETF launch they''ve ever had. Yes. But it didn''t seem to have much of a material impact on the market until Trump was president. Is it because he was elected or is it for other reasons? Let''s be transparent. So the two things you did see around $10 billion of inflows into the Bitcoin ETF, taking it to around $120, $130 billion, I believe. So a decent amount of speculative top up that came because of Trump. So you can attribute some of that to him. The reason that we haven''t seen sort of the continuation of the success that we saw in Q1 of last year is that institutional flows are larger, slower, and they have a higher bar to clear to invest. What does that mean? Institutional flows are slower. Why are they slower and who do we mean by institutions? Institutions like sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, people that are managing real money, like actual people''s life savings. And you might have a firefighter''s pension fund. Their bar to invest is much, much higher than say my personal investment bar or a hedge funds bar or family offices bar. And as you have to clear those hurdles, they''re thinking about things like how long has an asset been around? It''s almost like how we think about DeFi. It''s stress tested. How long has Aave been around? Well, it hasn''t been hacked in how many years, therefore it should be relatively safe. They think about it in a similar way. This ETF was new. They needed to see adoption. They needed to see evidence, real world evidence of flows going in. And I know that''s a bit of a chicken and egg problem, but as they see that happen over the course of the year, those flows start to pick up. And you saw that with Trump coming in, we went from $110 billion to $120 billion really quickly. Yeah. It shows that they are there and ready and some of those investment hurdles have started to be cleared. There are other barriers to entry for them as well. We can get into them, but to go back to what I was mentioning before, liquidity becomes really important. They have to look at an asset and say, can I deploy the size that I need to deploy? They''re not putting in a few million dollars here and there. We''re talking about trillions of dollars of net aggregate assets that could come in. They need liquidity. And even Bitcoin at what, two plus trillion dollars in value today isn''t prepared for trillions to enter the market. Not yet. Exactly. But let''s not talk about that right now. Let''s talk about, again, Donald Trump coming into office. Let''s focus on this. So he comes in. He says, I''m going to go and appoint a crypto council. I''m going to appoint a crypto czar. He says, I''m going to go and clean up the SEC. I''m going to go and essentially reformat CFTC as well and every other regulator, the OCC. And he did. Yes. There''s an essentially fully Republican CFTC, SEC, OCC and all the other major regulators. And the crypto council. The crypto council seems to be happening in some format. So he''s fulfilled his promises at least thus far. Yes. Markets have not really responded. So it seems as effusively as you would have anticipated. At least I would have anticipated. Why? So there''s two sides to the coin. One is that he went and enacted the starting volley of what he has to do to move down that path. But it takes time. And crypto markets notoriously have short attention spans, move extremely quickly. Crypto people are ADD? No way. No way. I''ve lost some people already in the audience, I''m sure. But no, it''s such a fast moving industry that our expectations are also much, much higher. We change and innovate constantly. And at the end of the day, Donald Trump is the president of the United States in Washington. As much as Elon and Trump are trying to change things, it''s still Washington for now. And they will change how it works and it will move faster over time. But that won''t happen overnight. And markets are impatient. So when announcements are made that aren''t, I''m going to buy Bitcoin using taxpayer dollars for strategic reserve now, right now, press the button. People are disappointed. But it hasn''t happened yet, right. And even the new SEC chair has not been confirmed yet. The new CFTC appointee, I should say, has not been confirmed or nominee has not been confirmed yet. So it''s true. There''s a kind of a slower cycle. It''s a lag effect, yeah. A lag effect. So maybe that''s partially to blame. Yes. The other side of the coin that I''d want to touch on is Donald Trump is Donald Trump. So lock in for the next four years, it''s going to be volatile. And volatility is a double-edged sword. You''re talking about macro volatility. Macro volatility. Okay. Like the tariffs, the trade wars. Exactly. So like people were disappointed he didn''t announce enough pro-crypto action at that moment in time. And then at the same time, in the other part of his presidency, he''s now picking fights around the world with tariffs, which is arguably a valid approach. Depends on your views on the matter. But at the end of the day, it''s going to lead to more volatility. And going back to the investor bar to clear for a lot of these pension funds, real money funds, sovereign wealth funds, they can''t be investing in assets that have such extreme volatility. You know, it''s funny. Bitcoin used to be discussed as essentially something that was, well, going to run counter to macro markets. Yes. And equities went down, Bitcoin would go up. Yes. Doesn''t seem to be the case. Yeah. That changes as it becomes institutionalized, right? Like when it''s a speculative hedge or it''s a flight to risk or a flight to safety, assets can change in their dynamic over time as to what they represent. No asset is static. It''s dynamic in its profile. It''s dynamic in its understanding. People are understanding as the world shifts what Bitcoin can represent as a store of value asset that could be, you know, part of the financial system going forward. So I''m a proud American. And I love the fact that I won''t necessarily lose a bank account again. So Waxman, my company, was debanked by Chase a few years ago back in 2018. Why? Because we were in crypto. So I''m not going to have that problem again, so it seems, in the United States. And consequently, I would think as an entrepreneur and other entrepreneurs, we''ll be able to do things like hire in America. Yes. Like set up business in America. Raise capital in America. Yes. And it should have, I would hope, some sort of beneficial effect on kind of the crypto industry in the U.S. From your perspective, looking at this as, again, a macro strategist, do you see there being an additional concentration of crypto talent, liquidity, capital in the United States moving forwards? Like undoubtedly, the U.S. is the biggest market in the world for a reason. Like ignoring crypto for a second, it is the place where people want to do business. Consumers spend more. It''s the market. And so it''s definitely going to suck in a lot of liquidity and capital and investment and good talent. And that''s great for the industry because we''ll see a lot more innovation coming out of the U.S., which has time and time again proven itself to be the global innovator. Like Silicon Valley exists for a reason. Yeah. That''s going to continue. And we''re going to see that in crypto. So that''s great for the industry. The other side of the equation there is that that talent is going to come from somewhere and that capital is going to come from somewhere. Right. So it''s a bit of a, to a certain extent, a zero sum game. Yes. So, I mean, people are going to, are they going to leave Hong Kong and leave Singapore? Are they going to leave Malta? So that''s the question that regulators in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malta, the Middle East have to start thinking now. In the last two or three years with the U.S. administration being, let''s call it crypto hostile, or at least not clear on whether they were going to be crypto hostile or not. Which is tacitly hostile. Which is tactically hostile, for sure. In that scenario, people couldn''t invest in the U.S. and deploy talent there or capital there. So these regulators in Asia were able to take their time because there was no competition. Now there''s competition. We''re about to see true capitalism at work. Where the best talent is, where the best capital is, that will be where innovation happens. And the decision that Hong Kong, Singapore, the Middle East, Malta have to decide is how much risk they want to take to make themselves attractive to bringing some of that innovation in and keeping it in their borders. So let''s pull this out a little bit. Earlier you were talking about how real money is entering the space. Yes. Can any small country like Singapore, for example, or a place like Hong Kong, can they risk not being part of the trillions of dollars that might flow into a new industry? Aren''t they going to be kind of forced to compete? They''re forced to compete. And to try to win some of this talent and the entrepreneurs to stay here? And it will mirror the way the world works pre-crypto. They have to find their niche. All these countries don''t just exist as second sideshows to the US. They have their own industries and their own innovation and they do their own thing. Like they can''t compete with the US when it comes to capital potentially, but they can innovate in areas that the US regulatory environment may not be interested in pushing into. So the US will pick its areas. It will regulate. It will create frameworks that people can work with in. And the other regulators and the other areas around the world will need to pick a niche that they can innovate and add value in. And I think that''s the net positive because we''re going to get more access, more talent, more capital, but we''re going to get new types of innovation because we''re forced to have these areas become unique and become different in their own rights so that they can maintain some relevancy. Because if you stop and don''t act, irrelevant straight away. Yeah. I can imagine that without a new plan, a revitalized plan, for example, Mika in Europe, they''re going to have to have Mika 2.0 if they want to go and make sure there''s anyone left there. Correct. Correct. Yeah. So it''s, I mean, it''s not too dissimilar from a market making high frequency trading firm like us. If we stop innovating and we stop building new algorithms and improving our product suite and working with new client types, if we stop that, well, our market share is gone. We''ll just get slowly eaten by the new guy who''s innovating and sucking in all the talent and the capital and the clients and then we''re irrelevant. So I think it''s really, it''s a reflection of, you know, the way the world works anyway. You have to continue to compete and stay ahead of the game or your lunch will get eaten eventually. And it''s really important that the people here in this hall, that consensus in Hong Kong, push and vocally push for that to happen so that we can have multiple hubs with lots of innovation of different types around the world and lots of opportunities. for people to build, invest, participate in what is a new financial system for the world. Fantastic. Well, I guess, thanks for talking with me about Trump Crypto Catalyst. It''s been great having you and we''ll talk again next year. Thanks, David. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Cheers. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.', 'Music All right.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('fireside__bitgo', 'Fireside_ BitGo', '未知講者', ' Fireside Chats', ' I''m Tom Farley. I''m the CEO of Bullish. This morning, I''m proud to tell you that as part of Bullish, we own the CoinDesk slash Consensus business. I have the best colleagues in crypto who have put on this conference. What a tremendous success. It''s so awesome to be here. In my day job as the Bullish CEO, we run a global crypto exchange. And we have a, I believe our largest office is here in Hong Kong with just amazing colleagues. And in fact, late last night, we received the full license to operate as a crypto exchange types one and seven from the SFC here in Hong Kong, which were. So thanks to Julia, Elizabeth or others from the SFC for putting up with us for the better part of two years. We''re excited to bring global liquidity, really unique way we did it, where we''re going to onboard customers here. We''re going to keep the custody here and provide access to a global pot of liquidity. So anyway, that''s enough about me. The reason why I''m excited here is I''m with crypto OG. I''m going to call him Mike Belshi. And I say that because he was just telling me the origin story of BitGo from 2011. And he referred to, you know, I was talking to these OGs of crypto. And I''m thinking to myself, you''re an OG of crypto. So 2011, he started BitGo. Fast forward. Here we are 2025. BitGo is, I''ll call it the premier custodian for crypto globally. And they''re doing a number of other things. I''ll refer to them as a custodian, but it''s a broader business, as you''ll hear. And for full disclosure, Bullish has used BitGo as our principal custody solution from our outset. We have some other things we''ll do in terms of custody. But they''ve been a great partner. So I am a little bit biased up here as a moderator. I''m not up here as a journalist because I love Mike. I love the business. And so you know where I''m coming from. So with that, let''s get started. Mike, wow. I don''t even know where I want to start. There''s so much fun going on in crypto. Let''s start with the nuts and bolts. Can you give a sense to the audience? What do you see for just, in general, the custody business writ large, both for BitGo, but writ large as an industry over the next year or two? Let''s start generic. Sure, sure. Well, thank you, Tom, by the way. Thank you guys for being clients, partners. You''ve been fabulous for a long time. By the way, the bullish team probably stressed us the most in terms of verifying the underlying technology is fully recoverable without BitGo at all. So the whole point of what we do is we start with this security layer of two out of three, multi-sig, MPC. But no matter what, it''s always two out of three, which protects against theft and loss. You guys test all of that stuff, and you make sure that we''re doing it right. So anyway, thank you for being great clients. Let''s see. In terms of where custody is going, custody, I think, is kind of this thing that''s mostly behind the scenes. People don''t really see it that much. They think of it as a commoditized business. They think it''s going to run exactly like State Street, like BNY, kind of these types of guys. And look, in the traditional markets, which are very established over decades, you can see why people think that way. But crypto is just getting started, right? So I did my first kind of market structure chat with JPMorgan executives probably around 2016. And I come from the technology world. I come from the crypto world. You outline what''s going on in the CFTC world. You know, you''ve got your DCMs in the middle. You''ve got your FCMs on the side. And in the equities world, you''ve got your brokers. You''ve got your exchanges. You''ve got your clearings parties, et cetera. And then in crypto, you''ve got like one guy. And he acts, oh, I''m bullish, right? It acts like the client''s broker, like the seller''s broker, the buyer''s broker puts it all together. Custody and market structure for crypto is just getting started. So as a result, you know, custody''s got a lot of work to do. It''s not a commoditized thing. We do a ton of R&D, as evidenced by, you know, the thousands of coins that are constantly coming through. And every single one of them needs a lot of new work, right? So anyway, with custody, we do staking at the bottom. I''m sorry, we do wallets at the bottom. We do custody above that. And then on top, we do services. So staking, trading, borrow, lend, settlement services, tri-party collateral management. We have GoUSD, actually, a stable coin coming very soon. When I look at custody for other asset classes, the custodians, the main custodians, no matter what asset class we go through all around the world, are these gigantic companies. So they''re typically trust companies or banks with $100 billion balance sheets. Is that what''s going to happen in crypto? So, you know, are we going to see more of those types of players come in to challenge BitGo? Look, I''ve been getting that question since around 2016. I remember meeting with Abby Johnson and Fidelity back in those early days when they were just getting started. Look, the traditional world is going to start with Bitcoin, and extending into other assets is pretty difficult for them. As evidenced by, you know, you look at the Fidelity offering today, which is a great offering. It''s got the full faith of, you know, the Fidelity balance sheet behind it. So that''s got an appeal, and it''s got a market that it hits. It hasn''t really affected our business. It turns out, you know, the ETF business, you know, just like for the asset managers, you know, the ETF business, they don''t make the bulk of their money off of the ETFs, right? Now, it''s an important part of what they do. It''s good money. They like it. But, you know, it''s all the other stuff that they do, and the same thing is true with us. So we support all of these assets, all of these tokens. We support them in a number of contexts that traditional finance can''t do. We''re global. You know, most of those companies are kind of U.S.-centric. First, they do hit internationally, but, you know, we continue to duck and weave with the changes in innovation in a way that they don''t. Let''s pivot. We''re a couple of Americans up here on the stage, for better or for worse. Terrible. Why don''t we give – oh, hi, Elizabeth. Why don''t we provide a little bit of insight in terms of what''s going on in our home country? Mike and I had breakfast in May of 2024, and we were lamenting the terrible state of regulation and enforcement in the U.S. You know, a regulated environment''s fine, an unregulated environment''s fine, but an opaque environment with lawsuits flying around where you don''t know what to do is really just agonizing. And we didn''t see really any end in sight. So now let''s fast forward. It''s mid-February. What''s the state of play in the United States in terms of regulatory, perhaps possible legislation we''ll see this year? And in general, how are you feeling? Well, like, it really couldn''t be any better. It''s like we went to sleep, woke up, and we just had, like, the most amazing dream ever. So not only did we get kind of what we were hoping for, which is a president that put in some regulators that didn''t want to kill us. That''s really all we wanted. It''s a pretty low bar. Instead, we got a president that''s deep in on crypto, regulators that are all in our crypto, whether you''re talking Paul Atkins going into the SEC, Brian Kintens going into the CFTC, used to be a board member at BitGo Trust Company. We got David Sachs, an investor at BitGo. He''s the crypto AIs are. Like, it really couldn''t be better. But I think if you want to relate it outside the U.S. a little bit, it''s also really good globally. So we have seven custodians. We operate around the world. We got Switzerland. We got Germany, Dubai, Singapore, Korea. So we talk to regulators everywhere. And, you know, frankly, the regulators do look in all of these countries. They do look to the U.S. for guidance, for better or worse. And the U.S. being pro-crypto makes it so much easier for them to be pro-crypto as well. So this is going to be fantastic in terms of opening up markets globally, not just in the U.S. And what about legislation this year? Are you expecting to see legislation come out of Congress that will clarify, you know, I don''t know, basic things like what''s a security? What isn''t a security? Who can issue a security? What sort of transparency do they provide? Any thoughts? Look, the team that''s there feels they''ve been dealt a totally winning hand in terms of the ability to get things through. So not only do you have Trump, of course, you''ve got the House and the Senate controlled by the Republicans. So there''s an opportunity to make real change. So they are ready to go. They''re ready to do stablecoin legislation. They''re ready to do whole new regulated regimes in addition to the CFTC and the SEC. That might be good. That might be bad. It could take a little bit of time. But they are ready to go make big changes for sure. Let me ask you a question a little bit off topic. A topic du jour. I woke up this morning and a colleague of mine, Danny Nelson, had broke an amazing story, a bit scary, that Javier Malay, the gentleman who launched this Libra stablecoin, had sent a text saying that he was bribing Malay''s sister, effectively, paying Malay''s sister. And he had Malay in his pocket. And this is part of why Malay was advocating for this stablecoin that ultimately resulted in great losses. Why am I asking you about that? BitGo has typically been a quality over quantity in terms of tokens. I know that as a customer. What are your thoughts on the rise of memecoin trading, the proliferation of memecoin trading, given the pros and cons? Do you see it ultimately as a good thing for digital assets and capital formation? Is BitGo looking to get into more memecoin custody or businesses? Any thoughts on this? Look, we just want to be a great custodian and service provider. So people get to pick what assets they deem are quality or not quality. Obviously, we do diligence on everything. Our regulators require us to do a pretty lengthy form. By the way, AI helps with filling out those forms. But they require us to do a lengthy evaluation of everything that we list. We''re still able to list memecoins, and we do that for folks that want it. My personal opinion, however, look, we have global markets, and you cannot put the genie back into the bottle. So people all over the planet are creating new stuff every day. And the innovation is so fast, you know, bullish is having trouble keeping up with it. BitGo''s having trouble keeping up with it. The regulators, they''re having trouble just watching it, right? So there''s so much change. What I fear is that we could have an overreaction from the legislators and the regulators. The reality is, you know, with the Malay coin, there''s a bunch of retail folks that were damaged. And, you know, people love to brag when they win a bet. But when they lose a bet, they''re like, who do I blame? And I fear that we could see regulators try to close things down. And then that actually could hurt for global markets. I mean, one of the best things about digital assets and blockchains and all this that we''re doing is we''re able to connect markets globally that we''ve never done before. So unfortunately, the meme coins, you know, they could lead to regulatory retaliation, which I think would set us back. I hope that that doesn''t happen. I think most of us here probably hope that doesn''t happen. But look, we''ll see. This is the yin and the yang of regulatory versus innovation. I did an interview with Annabelle of Bloomberg Asia this morning, and she said, Tom, there was an article saying that bullish was contemplating an IPO in the United States. Can you tell us more? And I was squirming in my chair because you can only say so much about IPOs or you''re violating regulations. So it''s kind of fun. I get to turn the tables. Mike, I read an article that BitGo is contemplating an IPO. Tell us more. Very clever. Look. Much more fun to be on this side. Let me just say it this way. The mission statement of BitGo is delivering trust in digital assets. You know, in the early days, it was about technology. Like, you know, how do you secure these assets in a way that, you know, you''re not going to get rug pulled, protects against loss of passwords or hard disks and all this. And so we pioneered that. Eventually, we added this regulatory layer. How do you do it in a compliant way? We do that globally. But that delivering trust, you keep doing it. Look, one of the things I think in order to address Wall Street, you''ve got to be a public company. And we''re seeing this where some companies on Wall Street in particular, look, they tried to interface with private companies, Silicon Valley due diligence companies like FDX. That didn''t work out so well, right? So they''ve learned that, like, diligence really matters. And the SEC process, the SEC diligence, the oversight, I think, is a key part of delivering trust. So it''s in the destiny. And then I''ll not comment on timeline. Yeah. Just for what it''s worth, I completely agree with you. I mean, we''re in the digital assets industry, which is doing really great things. And that''ll be my next question for you about some of those great things. But let''s face it, there''s still a little bit of that negative sense from this flush out of frauds and charlatans that we saw. And I think anything that you can stack up, a balance sheet, which you have, a big four auditor, which we both have, really credible regulators. I''m not just saying that because of present company. But, you know, we got a German license. And we see institutional customers on the other side go, oh, OK, that''s good. And I completely agree. I think a listing on a public, very well-respected market is a great thing because it demonstrates your willingness to be transparent about your financials. And it provides a lot of confidence. Look, our job is to provide confidence to our clients and continue to provide innovation. Right. And sometimes it seems like those don''t go well together. And I think the traditional system, you know, back to that conversation I had with J.P. Morgan. Yeah, after I explained to them about the differences in market structure, they were very happy. They were light bulbs going off in their heads. You can see that. I asked them, I''m like, why am I telling you guys this? You guys are J.P. Morgan. Like, you know this thing in the back of your hand. Look, they''ve gotten to a point in traditional finance where, you know, the market structure is the way it is. And they don''t think about how regulation could be or what market structure could be that would be better. Instead, they think that''s the way it is and how do they get their job done. I think in our industry, we''ve got systems thinkers. We''ve got programmers. We''ve got, you know, folks that are rethinking, like, how would you rebuild these markets now that you have computers? Because remember, SEC started before we had computers, right? But we can change everything, of course, for the more efficient, of course, for the more transparent. So our job is to make sure that continues to happen while also meeting, you know, some of the legacy rules and regulations and hopefully some of that changes in Washington in the coming months. So I want to close on probably my favorite topic in digital assets right now, which is the rise of stablecoins globally. For those of you who haven''t been paying attention, stablecoins have gone from around about $5 billion of market cap four and a half years ago to $200 billion today. And this is my view. What''s that? Not too shabby. That''s not too shabby. And my view is it will go to $2 trillion in the next two or three years. That''s my view. And quite frankly, maybe even higher. And when Mike and I work on, when our companies work together or even when Mike and I are backstage, we''re often talking about stablecoins. We''re both kind of nerding out about the potential there. But why don''t you share some of your thoughts on why they''re working, where you think it goes from here, and what is BitGo in particular doing, which I think is exciting? Look, I think it was kind of an overlooked innovation when it first came out. Tether deserves a lot of credit for having Bitfinex, for having driven that in the early days. But it''s just so clear at this point that it''s a better payment system. Look, the payment system, even outside of crypto, has been lacking from the banking sector for a long time. And you know this because the younger generation is switching over to Venmo. They''re switching over to Cash App. They''re switching over to WeChat Pay and other things. Banks could have had that role, but they didn''t. When it comes to stablecoins, runs 24-7. I actually am, I think, more bullish than you are on stablecoins. And we have, on Bias, we have our own, GoUSD. I think the stablecoins are the bank you wish you had, but you never did have. So people are now starting to learn how money works a little bit more. A bank is a depository. They take your money and they lend it out. Sometimes that works out pretty well. And we have some big institutions that have navigated it for a long time. There''s a whole bunch of institutions that died along the way. SVB was one of the scary ones not too long ago, Signature, Suffrogate. Banks take risks with your money. Stablecoins are 100% reserve in federal T-bills. When you put money in the bank today, how much interest do you get? 0.1%? T-bills get 4.5%. Why? Because the banks don''t need the money. They''ve got more money than they know how to lend out right now. All right. So I think stablecoins are going to be able to fill all of this. It''s actually what you wanted from your banking system. It runs 24-7. It''s all yours. It''s like cash. It''s a whole bunch of attributes. It''s just a win. Excellent. Well, two things in closing. One, thank you again for being here. We don''t take it for granted that you''re taking out of your time and your budget to be here at ConsenSys. Really, really fun start to this conference. I''ll be here for the next couple days and would love to meet any of you. Number two, please provide a warm round of applause for somebody who''s not just here on the stage giving us his insights, which were fabulous, but has really been toiling away to move the digital assets industry forward for the better part of 14 years now.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('fireside__cryptocom', 'Fireside_ Crypto.com', '未知講者', ' Fireside Chats', ' Raghuram Gaurav Reviewer Oh, wow. It''s so exciting to talk with the two biggest Eriks in Flickroup. It''s an exciting time, right? Have you been to Hong Kong before? Yeah, we actually started our journey in Hong Kong. We have a lot of great people, and it''s so great to see Hong Kong coming back into the space, launching their new regulation last year, onboarding new players in. So it''s super exciting, and I really love the energy. Everybody''s here for ConsenSys, so it''s great to be here. And welcome to ConsenSys. It''s great having you here. So let''s just dive into it. Let''s do it. I think we''ll start with the same question I asked Eric from Big Panda. What is your take on the major difference between this cycle and the previous ones? I would say the first point is institutions are finally in. Over the years, if you''ve been in the crypto industry, you will always say institutions are coming, and they''re coming, but they''re never there. Yeah. And I think in January of last year, when the Bitcoin ETF in the U.S. was approved, I think that was a momentous milestone for the industry. Right. And if you look at the inflow that has come into this ETF, it''s above $100 billion now. It''s about 5% of Bitcoin is in the ETF. Yeah. Traded volume is $700 billion. It''s massive. Yeah. So I think that is a huge difference. We''re seeing institutions coming in, participating, recommending also to their clients allocations into digital assets, 3% to 5% of portfolio. This is really big. And I think it''s a very huge new flow that we''re seeing in the industry. I think the second point is around regulatory clarity. Of course, the big elephant in the room is the U.S. We didn''t have that the last three years, but I think with the new administration that really want to bring back the U.S. in the leadership position in the digital assets space, we''re going to see that clarity coming in the next couple of months. So that''s going to be a big one, and everybody''s looking at the U.S. right now, and we''re actively contributing and participating in those conversations. Other markets like Hong Kong brought that clarity last year. In the Middle East, in the UAE and Dubai, two years ago we had VARA, and then some markets were a little bit ahead of time, like Singapore or France, like five years ago they already had that. But the last two, three years we''re seeing that regulatory clarity, and that means as a business we can invest, and we''re confident that we can do that safely. The last aspect I would say is AI and maybe tokenization, which is starting to pick up. All our lives have been changed by LLM and AI revolution for the last two years. The pace of innovation there is even more than what we''re seeing in the crypto space, and it''s already quite fast-paced. For me, when you look at the impact of AI in our life, it''s going to be the creation of all these AI agents that will provide services, different levels of expertise in different parts of the world to help you in education, in health, in different domains. And all these agents, there will be billions of them, will transact, exchange value. So we''ll see trillions of transactions between AI agents, and all of that will happen on the blockchain. So that ledger that enables value to be moved is going to be used massively in AI. And then on tokenization, again, institutions, they started with tokenizing fiat money, USD primarily. Now it''s about $200-plus billion of fiat money tokenized, USDT leading the pack quite heavily. And then now we''re seeing new financial instruments being tokenized, treasury bills, money market funds, and more instruments to come. And then we''ll see, maybe down the road, in specific markets, like assets like real estates and others coming also to the blockchain. So for me, those are kind of the three major trends that I see that are quite unique to this cycle. I''ll just touch upon one point that you mentioned, like regulation is so important, right, for a centralized exchange. I mean, you can''t do anything without it. Do you think the need of the hour is having separate crypto regulators? Or do you think it still needs to be under the overhang of the central bank or the securities regulator? Because as you said, crypto, like two years ago, we would have never thought AI would intersect with crypto or we would be here, right? So the industry changes so fast. Do you think it''s better to have like a dedicated regulator? I think what''s most important is having fit for purpose regulation. Whether we have a new regulatory body like we have in the UAE or we use existing regulatory bodies, I''m quite agnostic to that. Okay. But regulation needs to adapt to the asset class. I would say most assets are probably commodities-like type of assets. Some are going to be digital collectibles. Some are going to be e-money, especially the stable coins. And then in very rare cases, they may be security. Like if we actually tokenize a security, the tokenized asset is also a security. Security, yeah. So I think based on the nature of the assets, then we have to have the right regulation framework. And who manages that? Is it a dedicated regulator? Is it different regulators that have expertise in their asset class? I''m quite agnostic on this one. Okay. And talking about, I think, the most important thing for any crypto exchange, expansion, expansion, expansion, right? What are the regions sort of in your crosshairs right now for 2025? You know, we said institutions are in, right? So I think our main focus last year was really capturing that new flow. So this one is a more global trend and then we can go to the regional aspect. Our advanced platform, our exchange venue, became the number one USD-supported platform in the world. Last quarter, we did more than $1 trillion of volume on that. And we built a very strong OTC desk. We just got a few months ago, qualified custodian in the US, the Trust Corps, and in Singapore as well. So we really built very strong offering for institutional clients, whether they are the big asset managers or the market makers that contribute into the ETF flow and can deploy their strategy on our platform. So that has been very exciting journey to see, you know, the last year. If we look at market in particular, the big news, you know, the last few weeks is Europe and Mika. Finally, we have a uniform regulation across the European Union. That''s fantastic news. And we''re the first to passport and have it available across Europe. So for instance, there''s now new growth opportunities. We have clarity, we can market. So I''m already seeing a lot of uptrends there. It''s very exciting. We talked about a Binderlist. We have very high growth and we have governments that are innovative, bold, that are putting money behind, you know, growing the industry and the sector. And that''s quite unique. So, you know, I''ve been, last week I was in the World Government Summit meeting different participants, government regulators, and people of the ecosystem here in the UAE. And I think it''s fantastic to see the engagement. People really want to grow and then gain also leadership there. And then we have other markets where we are planning some new launches. It will be quite exciting in Brazil and South Korea. So, you know, this year there''s a lot happening and we''re looking forward to it. Yeah, I saw a twinge in your eye when you said new offerings. But I''m not going to grill you too much on that. We''ll wait for it as always. There''s also been like a certain, it always existed, but like there''s now a more fierce competition from DEXs, right? I mean, centralized exchanges also have to up their game in the coming years and months. What do you think is going to be the differentiating factor for a centralized exchange versus a DEX? Yeah, so, I mean, we have to admit it now, there''s a lot more activity on decentralized exchanges. That''s what we''re seeing. You know, when we started in the industry, maybe people were creating projects. We had like a couple of projects per month. Now we have 50,000 tokens created per day, right? It''s almost insane, right? And it''s very hard for consumers to grasp and to navigate. But definitely there''s been a shift and there''s a lot of volume coming from there. So I think when we look at centralized exchanges and, you know, having built businesses with a very strong foundation of compliance, that is something that reassures customers. Not everybody is going to be able to deep dive into 50,000 tokens every day. Having consumer protection, making sure there is market integrity. You know, we''ve seen the last few days, you know, insider trading and all the bad behaviors. You know, you have protection when you, you know, trade on an institutional venue or a venue that is regulated, right? So I think there''s a segment of customers that will still value that for quite some time. That level of protection and knowing that there are rules and frameworks in place to prevent bad behavior. Yeah. I think the second aspect is the connectivity to fiat. I think it''s still unparalleled. I think Crypto.com is very well known for having the ability to bridge traditional money to digital money very easily. So I think that is hard to replicate in the decentralized world. But at the end of the day, there''s an offering there. We need to be able to get it to some of our consumers that are a little bit more advanced or keen to experiment. But we need to find the right way of maybe having some kind of score or insights on what is coming there, tools for discovery. And maybe on a different platform, right? Could be our on-chain wallet, non-customer wallet and other offering that we have. So we give access, we''re a gateway for this new offering that is happening on the decentralized world. But we can put, you know, some more insight and information and educate consumers on that form. Yeah. I mean, I''ve been talking to so many leaders of centralized exchanges in the last few days. There''s an interesting, Gracie Chen said yesterday, like this is sort of the trash time for crypto. Of course, in context with the meme coins and everything. What is your take on that? You''ve mentioned it briefly, but do you think like it''s also like a passing fancy? Or do you think this has just done some damage to the sector, but it''s going to prop back up again? It''s a tough question. And, you know, definitely there is a lot of communities and engagement being created. And there''s also a lot of bad actors in that. So there''s pros and cons, I would say. It brings us a lot of the new generation in. Gen Z''s just, you know, want to discover and play. That being said, you know, as a financial institution, we need to make sure we put the right level of consumer protection. And my view is that different platforms and different levels of information we can provide to help people navigate this new world. It''s not going to go away. But I think different venues and different tools should be provided for people to safely experiment with those. Yeah. And you''ve touched on it briefly, but like what are your expansive views on tokenization and the B2B space in general? Because it''s like even like you said, we''ve seen from the beginning, we''ve seen like the early stages of peer tokenization. And now we''re even into real estate and probably a lot more in the coming years. Like what are your views on that? Do you think it''s something that centralized exchanges need to, you know, get on board with? And I''m like, I know crypto.com is doing it, but what are your overall views? Like, is that going to be one of the drivers for you in the coming years? Yeah. Our conviction is that, you know, in the next couple of years, in five, 10, 15 years, a lot of the assets that are usually today in traditional infrastructure will be tokenized and will be on the blockchain. So we started two years ago making sure we have the right licenses and frameworks so we can actually distribute those assets. As we talked, you know, before you have a security, if it''s tokenized, it remains a security. So you need a broker dealer to be able to distribute it. Right. So we''ve put that licensing framework in place so we can offer all these assets. We launch in the U.S. equity trading, spot option is coming. We''re rolling that out globally, FX commodities. So getting that infrastructure so people can actually trade those instruments and helping them tokenize them and bring the value of easy transfer, low cost, fractional ownership, all the good stuff that tokenization brings. So we do feel it''s going to be really big. We''re already prepared and I think we''re the first in the industry to expand our offering from pure crypto native assets to tokenized assets. Some will be used as collateral. I think a lot of trading opportunities, especially in the institutional flow. A lot of the big corporates have equities, they have bonds, they have even ETFs in their portfolio and they can''t use that as collateral and get opportunities to trade. So I do see a lot of value being created by tokenization and as an institution we''ll be preparing to distribute all those assets and then working now with the institutions to tokenize. Yeah. And so with the Trump administration coming in, this is sort of like the U.S. again, I think has taken sort of the market leader position. Like it''s driving a lot of hopefully a lot of new regulatory clarity into the space itself. What are your thoughts on this? Do you think specifically when I say like what is needed most from the U.S. side? Is the Bitcoin strategic reserve going to be something, you know, that''s going to change the crypto sphere forever or does the crypto industry just need more clarity from the states? Well, always all in for clarity. Especially, you know, when you want to run a business, it''s super helpful. I think the last three years we didn''t have that and most of the regulation was regulations through enforcement, which is, you know, not the ideal way. It''s not regulation, yeah. So right now this kind of is hosed and now people are thinking through what do we need to put in place to bring that clarity. There''s a working group that has been set up and in the next three to four months we''ll get some outcome out of that and hopefully a path to clarity. Generally, the administration is really pro-business and want to regain that leadership for the U.S. in the digital asset space. So we''re super excited about that. Talking about the reserve, it''s really, really cool and hot topic. I have to say I''ve traveled many countries last year and whether it''s central banks or rent funds or even treasury departments, everybody is already thinking about that. And these conversations are heating up. They''re like, where do I custody this? How can I trade? How do I manage this with my existing obligations as a central bank? So this is really a hot topic. And now that the U.S. is considering it, even already at the state level, there''s more than 20 states that have passed bill or, you know, going to pass bill to have some digital assets reserved. This is happening. For me, it''s inevitable. So which entity, whether it''s the Fed, whether it''s sovereign fund, whether it''s another entity in the Treasury Department, we''ll figure that out in the next few months. But it''s going to be part of a portfolio, not only of individuals, but now of states. Yeah. I mean, we''ve come such a long way, right? I mean, it''s so good to see crypto back in the news, not just back in the news for the wrong reasons, but back in the news for the positive cycle. And I think, oh, wow, we''re exactly out of time. So it was lovely chatting with you, Eric. Of course. Thank you so much for being at ConsenSys. And it was amazing. I think the chat has been really insightful for the audience. Thank you so much.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('fireside__wintermute', 'Fireside_ Wintermute', '未知講者', ' Fireside Chats', ' Hello everyone, you''re having a good time out here? Well, brace yourself, things are going to get a little more interesting ahead. My name is Omkar Godbole, I''m a markets editor at Coindesk and welcome to this fireside chat session with none other than Yves Gini Gavoy from Wintermute. Hi, thanks for joining us. Hi everyone. Yeah, so I would like to start by just asking what is the state of the crypto market here in Hong Kong compared to other parts of the region like Tokyo and Korea and Singapore? I mean compared to those two it''s definitely a lot more advanced. Like we''ve seen a lot more excitement last year around all the regulatory news. We''ve seen quite a few companies already applying for registration and getting registered. I think that being said, yeah, there is still more work to be done. I think the regulations can be, I would say, loosened a bit. Like they''re still like not optimal. I think compared to Singapore it''s still not competitive on regulatory side. So yeah, I think there is general expectations that on one hand there will be pressure to become more competitive with Singapore, for example. On the other hand, seeing all the positive signals that we see from the US, for example, on regulatory side, that other geographies will have to follow suit as well. How about Japan? Like it''s one of the advanced nations which has pretty much a clear regulatory picture for digital assets. And retail FX trading particularly is very huge there. So I''m wondering if that''s translating into more activity in crypto or demand for crypto there? I think we''re still not there yet. And again, I think it''s a function of regulation getting a bit better, but also a lot of different like trading rails getting a bit better, like exchanges to be allowed, well, more widespread and allowed that. Like in general, I guess Japan is an interesting case where like there is a perception that they missed out on the whole Web 2 craziness in the last 10, 20 years and now they potentially don''t want to miss out on Web 3, but it''s not super visible yet. And there''s so much volatility in there, Japanese yen, but that''s not like really galvanizing any demand for alternative investments right now? Not that I know. Yeah. And what''s your thoughts on Korea? Like I heard that, you know, folks over there are trading all coins like APT and the rumor is that, you know, they trade APT to buy an apartment. So is it the same in other parts of the Southeast Asia here? No, I think, yeah, South Korea is very special in that. Like it''s, yeah, it''s a very crazy place, but it''s also a very closed up space. Like they don''t literally don''t allow, well, not just outside trading firms. My understanding is like even internal trading firms to operate on those exchanges. It''s very much closed space. Like, I don''t know, wind remittance is not present there, for example, for that very reason, because we don''t want to use, I don''t know, weird, shady structures to get access to the market. We''re actually waiting for their regulators to become open. And speaking of Singapore, is it more of a institutional appetite there, or you also see some retail demand there? I mean, probably there is a retail demand, but honestly, it''s a pretty small place retail-wise. It''s a much bigger market for on the institutional side. And yeah, from that perspective, from family offices, funds, yes, there is definitely a lot of interest. So they''re looking into maybe Bitcoin and other tokens as, you know, long term plays, or it''s just short term trading? Both. Both. And it''s like, do you think BTC has found a place in a traditional portfolio, which usually involves like a bit of equities, mostly 70, 30 equities and bonds? So do you have Bitcoin now? I think like the more traditional institution-wise you go, like the least, the less likely it is to see crypto there, even Bitcoin. So I think we still have a long way to go, for sure. Is it more, like is it regulatory, you know, lack of regulatory clarity that''s still, it''s kind of, you know, I would say, a hindrance to adoption? No, I think it''s just basically all those different threat-fight players being risk-averse and like just not getting into yet. But I think it will, again, I think it will change quite a bit with US adoption. Okay. And like, I think in Singapore, it''s more, they''re more pivoting towards tokenization of bonds. If I''m not mistaken, you know, they have, they have something like a Singapore dollar tokenized fund. And is it, is it more, they''re more interested in tokenizing real, real, real assets, like traditional assets? Well, I think time will tell. It''s, I think currently it''s still more on the experimentation pilot stage. I don''t think it''s anything, like, I don''t think it''s a very, very, like, I don''t want to say serious, like, I don''t think it''s very, like, widespread and big effort yet. Because, you know, I heard that there''s a lot of interest in tokenizing government bonds. Because I think, you know, if you speak to any average investor out there, you would pursue equities, probably less risky than bonds, which is quite, I would say, you know, against the textbook. But I think the issue, the issue with bonds is like the tick size is so massive. And, you know, all those yield and bond price fundamentals, I think that''s pretty difficult for an average investor to grasp. So if you, let''s say, tokenize the government bonds, I think it''s going to open a whole new demand from the retail space. What do you think? Like, do you mean on Singapore side of things? Yeah, yeah. I mean, just generally speaking. Well, in Singapore, again, like, I think the market is just too small. But, yeah, if you''re talking about, like, global, like, global audience, yeah, I think about what BlackRock is doing with Beedle, for example. But that''s a lot more interesting. That has a potential to grow into, like, well, not just billions, but trillions of AM in general, especially as, like, Beedle and products like this are basically allowed to be used as a margin on DEXs, for example, allowed to be used as collateral on lending protocols. Yeah. The more adoption those kind of products have, yeah, the more widespread and the more reach it will have towards people who would never get access to those products before. Yeah. And speaking of just market liquidity, like, how has it evolved, you know, given we have so much financialization of Bitcoin, like, you have ETFs popping everywhere. We had ETFs go live in the US, and then we have ETFs approved here in the Asian regions. How has that impacted the overall liquidity and just market making business? Yeah, I would say it''s currently obviously only limited to Bitcoin, I mean, to a much smaller degree, Ethereum. Yeah, Bitcoin, for Bitcoin, it becomes a lot, like, really important part of the market structure, I would say. Like, given just how many billions in UEM those products already have. Yeah, basically more and more volume trades on a daily basis, more and more, yeah, volume flows in those products. Like, there is a lot of, like, OTC activity, a lot of screen activity. So, yeah, it just becomes another important trading venue. So is it like a net positive for just in terms of liquidity and market making? Because it''s not just ETFs, like, we have other products as well. We have options, Ibit options. You know, we already have, you know, crypto options, like, doing billions every month on Deribit. So this whole, you know, gamut of products, like, is it helping, you know, boost overall order book depth, order book liquidity? Does it make it easier? Is it, let me just put out in terms of numbers, like, let''s say, is it much easier to execute a $5 million order right today than it was maybe before the ETFs went live? Probably not so much easier. I think, like, for Bitcoin, I don''t think it changed the equation that much for Bitcoin. But also, like, we need to ask ourselves, what does this interest in OTC, where does it come from? Like, if it comes from new players, like, from, I don''t know, people who did not bother buying Bitcoin on Coinbase or somewhere else before, and now they finally have an instrument to get exposure to, yeah, like, it should contribute to overall liquidity. But I think a lot of AUM is also coming from crypto native people or from people who held it in custody before. So it didn''t really change much. But that being said, like, a lot of those, like, Ibit, for example, like, it''s a, you can borrow it now, you can use it as collateral on, I don''t know, interactive brokers, for example. It''s, it does contribute to overall liquidity. And in terms of, like, just liquidity, are we back at, back to pre-FTX levels? I''m sure it might be for Bitcoin, but for altcoins, is it still tough out there? I would say it''s, yeah, months on months. Like, I mean, we are still living through the meme coin craze, right? So I think liquidity suffers because of that, because there is just still a lot more interest in meme coins than in, like, I don''t know, old school coins. Yeah. But, I mean, liquidity is not that bad, I would say, generally. Speaking of meme coins, like, we have this, every two weeks we get some meme coin and it zooms to billions of dollars in market capitalization and within hour it, you know, crashes. I''m wondering if it''s a net negative for the broader market. Does it pull out liquidity from the productive sectors like DeFi or other stuff? I would say, generally, yes. Like, any new token is by definition extractive to all the tokens that happened before it. I think we''ve seen this effect, like, very pronounced during the Trump token launch because basically, yeah, Trump token got massive valuation. Like, people are buying into it, but they''re buying into it at the expense of a lot of tokens on Solana, especially the meme coins. So we''ve seen a massive sell off that weekend. And that''s probably the easiest effect to see. But ultimately, yeah, any new meme coin basically sucks liquidity, sucks interest from all the previous ones. So would you call that Trump launch? Was it a positive for industry because we have an incoming president getting associated with the meme coin? Now, personally, I felt like, probably, it would have done something with DeFi or something that would have carried more weight. Rather than just a meme coin. What''s your take on that? Still processing, I would say. Yeah, it''s not that straightforward. Like, on one hand, it''s pretty incredible that a sitting president is launching something like this. On the other hand, yeah, like, the way it was done, it was just so abrupt and so unusual that, I think, for the first, like, four or five hours, people are still wondering whether it was, whether somebody hacked his account or something. So it''s, yeah, it is quite strange still. So people are still, the same people are still, like, trying to figure out what to do with it. And I''m wondering, is that probably the reason why the market is so flat right now? Because it feels like we''re back to October 2018. I remember it was, like, pretty flat around $6,000 back then. And it feels the same way. Is it because of meme coins sucking out the liquidity from the market? Yeah, again, I would say it''s, on one hand, well, on the crypto-native side, yeah, it''s just all about meme coins. And, yeah, there is a lot of, yeah, it''s like the market has been very saturated with meme coin launches, it seems, especially, I don''t know. We had a melee over the weekend. For some reason, it always happens during the weekend. I''m not sure, like, why they do it like this. It''s definitely really annoying for trading firms. But, yeah, we, like, as a trading firm, we basically now have a lot more people working on the weekends just anticipating those kind of launches. So, yeah, but, yeah, back to the question, it''s, yeah, crypto-natives are, yeah, kind of exhausted by this. And I think it''s, people don''t necessarily appreciate that we have a lot of positive, yeah, positive news coming. Yeah. Upcoming, for example, on regulatory side, I mean, it seems like we all forgotten, like, how bad influence SAC was, even CFTC was, last four years. And now, like, this overhang is just completely gone. And it''s not even neutral, it''s actually positive, all the news that we see from SAC lately. So I don''t think that the fact is priced in properly. And on Threatify''s side, I think it''s just ongoing. It''s just, yeah, just moving slower, slowly but steadily. So I''m pretty optimistic, actually, where we are. Yeah, I agree with you that there are a lot of positive news coming up, but they''re not getting priced into markets. Also, if, you know, I sometimes wonder, like, if there''s a pension fund out there, probably considering, you know, investing in Bitcoin, and then they look at these headlines, you know, the Trump meme coin went to $5 billion, $8 billion, and it suddenly crashed. You have that melee thing going on over the weekend. Is it sort of a bad optics? And, you know, do you think that, you know, these kind of headlines, you know, pension fund looks at these headlines and then says, oh, you know, I''m not, I''m better off, you know, away from crypto. Or probably I might just do the arbitrage play rather than an outright investment, long-term investment. I guess it depends, like, how sophisticated they are in their analysis. Like, if I were a pension fund, I would look at, okay, yes, okay, all this, like, craziness happening, but, I know, let''s look at Solana. Like, they have tens of thousands of meme coins sometimes being launched on a daily basis. They have massive volumes going through on a daily basis. Okay, it''s all speculative and it''s all extractive and horrible, sure, but you also see the chain that was actually casually, like, being, like, turned off, like, just two years ago. They actually sustain in this, like, we have protocols, like, JITO, like, Jupyter working and making fees out of it. Like, you actually see the chain working as it should. And so it''s kind of, it''s more of a question, okay, should they invest into Solana because it works so well, because there is a stress test and it survives it every single day, or should they not invest into Solana because currently, like, everything is just meme coins, and maybe when meme coins will die off, productivity will die off as well. So that would be a more sophisticated analysis to make for them. Yeah, and speaking of positive regulatory developments, do you foresee XRP or Solana getting their first ETFs in the US? I wouldn''t, I would definitely not be surprised if Solana and some other tokens would get ETFs. Like, it would make a lot of sense. And for Solana specifically, and maybe for, I would say, for top 10 market cap, like, if you exclude stable coins, obviously, it would make a lot of sense to have ETFs, and I think they would attract significantly. It''s more like there is a lot of excitement when there is a new ETF being proposed by some issuer. And I would say if it''s altcoin, which is, I don''t know, number 48 on coin market cap, I think it''s quite unlikely that it will be launched in the first place, because the equation for a lot of those ETF issuers is that, like, the ETF should reach, I would say something like 100 million a year for it to be profitable. And if they don''t expect it to be the case, like, I don''t think they will launch it in the first place because it''s just going to be net loss for them. So the CME futures is no longer a prerequisite, like, for Bitcoin and ETH, I think the futures came first and then we got the ETFs. I think it was a relic from the previous SEC era. Yeah, I think it was a prerequisite because that was something previous SEC leadership was sort of fine with. I don''t think current SEC cares, but, I mean, I might be wrong, but I don''t think it''s a prerequisite anymore. And on a lighter note, what''s your prediction for the rest of the year in terms of price? When do you see this boring market resolve in the next bullish leg higher? Yeah, I mean, I think there is a Bitcoin and there is everything else. I do see Bitcoin price continuing to go up this year. As for other tokens, yeah, like, I don''t think we''ll see a proper, like, everyone is waiting for alt season, for example. I don''t necessarily think we will see an alt season, I think. But I do think we will see some kind of, I don''t know, for lack of a better word, like, flight to quality, basically, like, so people looking at tokens, looking at protocols that actually work, that establish themselves, that aren''t actually working as intended, potentially sharing fees or buying back tokens or burning tokens or whatever, like, so there are some sustainable, like, tokenomics in place, like, even though I hate this word. But basically, if there is something sustainable and there is a real protocol with real people behind it, I think that''s where people will start putting their money in. So what you mean to say is, like, gone are those days when you would just put money into altcoins and they would rise. It''s like a stock picker''s market now. Yeah. Yeah, I think meme coins basically showed us that, yeah, like, the whole meme coin craze started because of, like, this high FDV, low float scene, right? Yeah. I think people will soon start to realize, or actually start already realizing that meme coins is an even worse game from a statistical standpoint. And also, all these recent meme coin launches also show that on top of this being statistically bad for people, like, it''s just a really bad statistical game, like, casino-wise, it''s also rigged, it''s also double rigged because there is so much inside activity going on. So, like, part of this flight to quality would be, well, my guess would be towards the protocols that are much more open about, like, how they operate, how they distribute tokens, how they sell tokens even. So I think we will see a lot of openness and transparency going forward. Okay. All right. That was a really insightful session. Thanks for joining us. Yes. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('fireside_with_web3_foundation_s_cfo', 'Fireside with Web3 Foundation_s CFO', '未知講者', ' Fireside Chats', ' My name is Max Ruebal on behalf of Polkadot. A very warm welcome here in Hong Kong. I''m based in Hong Kong, by the way, so I''m very excited to see so many faces join us here from overseas. And I''m particularly excited to welcome Thomas, the COO and CFO of the Web3 Foundation, which is the foundation behind Polkadot. So we''re going to have like a 20-minute fireside chat here, the two of us, and then afterwards move on to a panel discussion with builders on Polkadot. Now before I get into it, who am I and why am I moderating this conversation here? So I''m kind of having two different roles within the Polkadot ecosystem. One is what you can see here, Polkaport East, which is a growth and IR initiative for Polkadot in Hong Kong. And the second thing is Harbor Industrial Capital, which is a Polkadot-focused VC fund, also based out of Hong Kong and focused on investing in early-stage startups within the Polkadot ecosystem. So with that, let''s get started with our conversation with Thomas. Thomas, very, very nice having you here. Flew in from Switzerland to Hong Kong. Thomas, start a little bit with your background. You''ve been in the Polkadot space for quite a long time. Maybe can you walk us a little bit through your journey in Polkadot? When did you first meet Gavin, for example, and how did you decide to become involved at the foundation for Polkadot? Yeah. Thanks, Max. Thanks for having me. Pleasure to be here. I kind of came into the Polkadot ecosystem through my business angel and venture capital activity. Started doing that in 06 and then went into the rabbit hole of Bitcoin. And in Switzerland, as you are well aware of, there was this development of the crypto valley around Zug, greater area, Zug and Zurich. And hence a lot of protocols and projects were arriving and kind of developing and launching. And I followed these protocols. And then in 19, I had my first touch point with Polkadot. So quite early. Yeah. I was participating in the funding, the private sales. And three years ago, when Three Foundation got in touch with me again because he had to fill a position as CFO. And we engaged. After having certain discussions, I kind of took that opportunity. And a couple of months later, my mandate got broadened a bit. Today I''m responsible for the operations and finance of the Web3 Foundation. Okay. Then let''s dive directly into this topic. What is it really that the Web3 Foundation does for Polkadot? And maybe also how did the role of the foundation change over time? Yeah. I think the mission of the foundation didn''t change a lot since the establishment back in 2017 it was. So it has always been enforcing and supporting the development of the decentralized Web. And we do that through supporting Polkadot, through the development of Polkadot, which is our native protocol. We have a canary protocol, test protocol, Kusama. But the main focus is on Polkadot. And for me it''s really important that the people here recognize that Web3 Foundation is not the managing entity or the manager behind the protocol, but rather a shepherd, a coordinator. And all decisions actually related to the future of the protocol are taken by the dot holders through open governance. That''s a good keyword. So there''s gov on the one hand side and then there''s the foundation on the other hand side. For the foundation, what are some of the key programs that you''re running to support the growth? So I first probably go into the growth drivers and then the programs. So if we talk about growth drivers, what the foundation really does, the clusters within the foundation, we have three of them. So the first is a cutting edge research team. A lot of people don''t know that, but we have quite a big team actually focusing on research in cryptography, in game theory and in economics. And these findings flow them back into the engineering work that is being done by Parity, who is our core engineering entity. And then we have education and governance coordination, which shouldn''t be underestimated as well because education is kind of the layer of the adoption, right? If you do not educate people, if you do not communicate what Polkadot is capable to do, you know, the adoption will not follow, right? So these two pillars are actually not as known as the other one. And the biggest, the last, is actually the funding program. So we have a dedicated grants program, which has three sub-clusters. The first one is the regular grants program, which is publicly known, very transparent, and we supported over 600 teams and projects so far in the past. And if we talk about amounts given away, you know, we talk about millions, right? It''s really material. And it''s all about supporting open software development. Then we have a second layer, a second cluster, where this is called Founders Grants Program, where we really want to catch the talents very early, at the early stage, and support them. And the third one is a strategic grants program. Everything else that doesn''t fit in the other two boxes goes into that program. And there we talk also about bigger tickets. Got it. Yeah. When talking about this funding, you often mention the flywheel effect that the foundation is trying to achieve. Yeah. Can you elaborate on that? Yeah. Let me first dive into other programs we have, actually. So we have this funding program. But recently, we also launched decentralized nodes. Ah, yeah. Okay. Under the umbrella of decentralization, which we are a firm believer in, you know, decentralization and resilience is basically the core kind of non-negotiable point for Polkadot. We launch decentralized nodes where we have an application process. You know, potential validators can actually apply. Mm-hmm. Go through that application process. And once they pass that, we basically nominate them to be in the active set. Then we have a second program that was launched a couple of months ago, decentralized voices. Again, under this resilience decentralization umbrella, where we try to achieve also diversification on the open go off side. Right? So we have quite an active open governance framework and active community. And we strive for that. This is kind of something we want to see. However, you know, the foundation has quite a lot of dot holdings. And we actually abstain from voting whenever we can. So by doing that, we established actually wanted to activate these voting, that voting power, and established decentralized voices where, you know, DAOs teams within the ecosystem can apply again. If they pass, we actually nominate or delegate the voting power to them so that they can actively, actively contribute to the open governance. Got it. And then there''s a third one, decentralized futures. Yeah. Decentralized futures was one of the biggest, actually. So that was launched back end of 23 when we had a resetting within parity and Web3 foundation. We wanted to focus again on kind of what we are doing. And this is engineering, right? And for the first time with that program, we supported actually non-engineering work heavily. So we went into marketing, business development, growth opportunities, event management, open golf coordination. And this was a huge program. It was five million dots and $20 million all in back then with the prices we have seen end of 23. We were talking about 55, $60 million equivalent. Wow. Yeah. But this has basically stopped end of 24 and is now a part of the strategic grants program. Okay. And then going back to this flywheel that you were talking about? Yeah, right. The flywheel. So when I arrived at the Web3 foundation, there was this constant claim that, you know, there was a funding gap within the ecosystem. And I wanted to tackle that. So I''m quite the structured guy. I want to approach solutions in a structured way. So I came up with that conceptually with that flywheel where we have five components. And when we tackle these components and give them a push into the right direction, the whole flywheel should actually activate the self-funding mechanism within the ecosystem. Okay. And let me deep dive quickly into these components. You know, first of all, it starts with the value proposition of Polkadot with the technology step, which we are a firm believer in, of course. And then it goes into early stage capital. And if I talk about early stage capital, I don''t mean VC funding. I rather mean projects that need funding before they are ready for VC funding. So we talk about the grants program. Then it''s liquidity provisioning. We do liquidity provisioning through different vehicles indirectly into the ecosystem. And this is also something we need to strengthen, basically. We need to push more. This means also that we support actually infrastructure that enables liquidity provisioning, not only directly injecting liquidity into the ecosystem. The third component is multiple capital sources. And that''s quite an interesting one where we had actually focused on the last couple of months. We committed capital to various VCs out there. We were focusing on ecosystem VCs and now we are focusing actually on external VCs and invite them to participate in the ecosystem. This was quite a big push, actually. We had a long list of 25 names. We did some due diligence, of course, and ended up with a short list of roughly eight. And by the end of 25, we will have committed a substantial amount to them. And hopefully onboard it with six to eight of the VCs. This is one layer in that bucket, multiple capital sources. But then there''s another one where we focus actually to get more capital, more fresh dry powder in from the trade fi guys. And how we do that is we actually invite them to structure investment products. SPVs, OTC vehicles, but also exchange trader products where they actually gather money. And then, you know, with the hope that they activate actually the capital contribution into an injection into the ecosystem. And this is going quite well. So I can communicate that we had quite some success the last couple of weeks. And, you know, there will be more in the pipeline. The second last component is marketing and communications. This is something that we need to do better. You know, we need to tell people the storyline of Polkadot about the capabilities so that we attract developers, more developers in the ecosystem where they can actually build stuff. And then, of course, attract also end users of these products and applications. And, you know, last but not least, if all these components are actually pushed into the right direction and the positive momentum is created, hopefully investors who invested into Polkadot will get a decent return relative to the risk taken, of course, and reinvest into the ecosystem. So all in, you know, we are a firm believer that, you know, with that framework, if you push all these components in parallel, actually the self-funding process of the ecosystem will accelerate. Okay. Perfect. That makes a lot of sense. I do want to switch gears a little bit now, moving away from the role of the foundation to talking about Polkadot as a whole and basically how Polkadot positions itself. So we''re all familiar with, like, you know, the parachain auctions that we had in the past. Now we kind of move to agile core time. Nowadays Polkadot is often described as the AWS of Web3, like a decentralized supercomputer on top of which all kinds of applications, decentralized applications can be built. What''s your mental model that you use to describe Polkadot? Yeah, I really like actually that metaphor of AWS, right? And I think one of the core developers of parity technologies recently also mentioned that, as well as, you know, Bitcoin is sort of brought the world calculator. Ethereum, basically the world computer and Polkadot will bring the world cloud or core, multi-core cloud, right? And if you think about it, this is really exciting. People will be able actually to create their own computer, to make their own computer, or even rent multiple computers and deploy their products and services. This is something that hasn''t been seen before. This is new. Yeah. What is also new is Jam. So Gavin Wood was here in Hong Kong the day before yesterday, on Monday. We had a big talk over at Cyberport. We were there as well. It''s part of the larger Jam tour. Obviously, Jam is a very complex technical upgrade to Polkadot. It''s a major upgrade, and I''m personally very excited about it. I always like to say Jam has not been priced in yet. But what actually is Jam? Like what''s in the simplest terms that you can use, how would you describe what it does and how it improves Polkadot? Yeah. So first of all, I have to admit I''m not an engineer, right? But, you know, I have listening at talk on Monday and kind of doing my deep devs into the reading and material that is out there. I have two takeaways basically. You know, with Jam, going forward, there is quite a difference to what Polkadot is doing right now. Polkadot is, you know, focusing on verifying blockchains right now. And going forward, Jam, with Jam, you can basically almost deploy anything you can imagine. Really products and services and even if I got it right, even kind of Web2 applications on Jam, right? Which is a breakthrough basically. Yeah. And, you know, going a little bit into the second factor or takeaway I have as non-engineer is that, you know, I believe there are kind of two clusters of blockchains currently. One is more the monolithic approach from a design approach where probably Solana is part of. Of course, with that monolithic approach, you have certain pros and cons. The cons are probably on the resilient side, decentralization that is not as strong. And if you want to visualize that, I always, you know, kind of talk about two horses actually drawing a carriage, right? And there are only two horses. Yeah. So, you know, there''s a single point of failure. And with Polkadot, we talk about more kind of the modular design approach with charting. And there you have something like 100 chickens drawing a carriage, right? And with these 100 chickens, you have a communication issue at the hands which goes back to the word coherence, I believe, you know. And what I believe is that, or my takeaway with Jam is that Jam will give actually something like a coordinating layer, coordination layer over everything. And the services can talk to each other and hook up with each other. And, you know, if they do not need to do that anymore, they basically separate, go back and come together again. And by doing so, actually, you get the best out of the two worlds, which is amazing, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You mentioned Jam will enable like a bunch of very new, very exciting applications. What actually are the verticals that you''re most excited about for Polkadot moving forward? Let''s focus on the current state first. I think, you know, I''m most excited about everything that needs high throughput, which, you know, the testing that we did end of year showed that Polkadot is capable to do so. We reached like, if I''m not mistaken, more than 140,000 throughput transactions per second, which is far better than any other protocol out there. And I also believe that more complex projects that need more kind of complex features are made for Polkadot, basically. And, you know, Polkadot actually is that protocol that should actually draw in these projects. Talking about what these projects are, I think that the verticals, for instance, gaming. Oh, that''s good. I''m always kind of interested in that part. Internet of things or AI. And if we talk about names, you know, for gaming, it''s, of course, mythical. Then hydration, our decks, I really like because of that, also because of that feature, which is called Omnipool, where we have an aggregated liquidity pool compared to other protocols, other projects that provide basically just a single asset to single asset liquidity pool. And, you know, kind of one of the emerging projects I like is Accarest, where, you know, the guys try actually to use mobile processing power for distributed computation. Perfect. I actually think this is a great place to wrap it up because it is a segue into our next session. You just mentioned a few of the interesting applications that are building on Polkadot at the moment and some of the new ones that are moving into the Polkadot space. So I think it''s a great transition to move to our panel, which is a panel of Polkadot builders and projects that are taking advantage of the Polkadot infrastructure. And they are coming on stage right now, moderated by Tommy. For now, I can say thank you very much, Thomas. Thank you. Thank you. Let me just summarize something. Sorry. Yeah. Let''s reiterate our claim. More truth, less trust, and hopefully going forward, guys, also less noise. Thank you. Perfect. Thank you. Thanks.', 'My name is Max Ruebal on behalf of Polkadot.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('from_custody_to_liquidity__how_tokenisation_is_changing_financial_markets', 'From Custody to Liquidity_ How Tokenisation is Changing Financial Markets', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Thank you for joining us. It''s going to be a fascinating talk today, deep dive on tokenization. We''re going to take you through what it is, how we do it, why it matters, and maybe some big bold predictions as well. So some introductions. I''m James Harris. I''m Chief Commercial Officer at Zodiac Custody. We are a globally regulated digital asset custodian focused on institutions. We provide wallet services, but also technology to banks to allow them to provide custody services to their own clients. I can''t wait to introduce my panelists here. We''re going to have a really fun conversation. So Priscilla, do you want to say hello? Sure. Hi, Priscilla Adams. I look after bullish group compliance. So the company that has also brought you consensus here today. So we have a regulated exchange now here, licensed in Hong Kong, Germany, and in Gibraltar, and a number of other crypto related businesses. Hi, I''m Andrew Wong from UBS, and I run our fund tokenization platform and business. So really excited to be here today. Super. Yeah. Good afternoon. Aaron Kwok, founder and CEO of Libera. Libera is an incubated startup by SC Ventures, specializing in the tokenization of funds and bonds. And yeah, very happy to be here. I must confess, Aaron, I almost didn''t recognize you without your hoodie. I know. So nice to see you wear a suit as well. I''m trying to get back to my TradFi, a little bit of a TradFi look, but you know. TradFi vibe at a crypto conference. Absolutely. So look, let''s introduce the topic then. So we''ll start at the top and set some definitions. I think tokenization has recently sort of framed as a revolution, but really it might actually be looked at as an evolution of financial services and frameworks. And so to kick us off then, Aaron, how do you define tokenization? And what are its most promising use cases in the markets today? Yeah, I think tokenization, people think about it in two difficult terms, but I think the very basic thing to think about it is just a different way of clearing the same thing that you''ve had for a very long time. If you think about securities in particular, they used to exist on pieces of paper. Then they used to be centrally cleared by a central counterparty. Now they can be cleared by a blockchain. And that''s the only thing about it. And tokenization in its essence is not dissimilar to anything that we''ve been doing for centuries. The only difference is how the tech applies. In terms of what''s promising, I think the ability for you to not have to depend on a central counterparty to clear it actually takes securities and how it identifies and works within us back like a hundred years to where I could have a security and I give it to someone else who needs it and that would be it. It would be theirs and no one would have any doubt about that. And I think this is where we gain as individuals more control over our wealth and also at the same time remain absolutely compliant. So there''s a lot of promise around this and I''m very excited to be in the field. Yeah, thank you. And Andrew, you''re working on some very interesting things at UBS. Anything to add on that point in terms of use cases? Yeah, I think by tokenizing the asset, I mean, at the end of the day, financial services about writing stuff down and tracking kind of who owns what. And specifically here we''re talking about important things, cash, you know, assets, securities, et cetera. I think once you move it into this form, we''re most excited to see how we can connect this to other people to build together different products on top of each other. I think that''s the main thing. Yeah, yeah. There was a big announcement yesterday actually by our parents. I''d be remiss if I didn''t mention it. But Standard Chartered, Anamaka and HKT just launched the Hong Kong stablecoin. And the reason I mentioned, I think that''s interesting in itself, but stablecoins in very many, for many, many reasons are actually the original, the OG tokenized asset, right? So actually tokenization in digital assets has been happening pretty much since day dot with the advent of stablecoins. But Andrew, when I think about the institutions now actively exploring tokenization strategies and adopting tokenized assets, could you talk to a little bit of what problems are they solving? Like is it 10x better? Or why are we even doing this? There''s maybe two sides of it. You''ll hear from folks in the industry, and this is probably a debatable point of when they happen. So it could be 10x better on the cost side. Also 10x better on kind of the revenue or business opportunities if you can create a new one. I think the cost side comes over time as the entire system kind of moves on to the same infrastructure. You know, you have a lot of different places where you''re writing down assets, asset balances, cash balances, et cetera. So I think that comes, you know, over time. It''s kind of a longer term trend. But the business models are here today. So I think what''s very interesting, you know, a lot of firms starting to think about if I put my asset out there as a smart contract, who else''s smart contracts can connect to us? And can we build some new type of business logic that we couldn''t do before? Yeah, yeah, no, nice. And Priscilla, at Bullish, you''ve got a massive purview of things that you look at. So I''d love to hear your thoughts. Yeah, and I think that also coming from just the crypto native side, it''s partly how you shape it as what is the value proposition to a traditional finance institution. And I think at a very basic level, this comes down to economic growth and market creation. Yeah. So when you think about what is some of the opportunity that can be unlocked, right, it''s speed, it''s velocity of money. And the faster the money moves, the faster the settlement is made, the more transactions there are and the faster the economy grows. You don''t have money stuck. Right. Exactly. It''s not it''s not stuck. You''re moving from a nine to five trading venue in country X to 24 seven. And if I were sitting on the institutional side, I would see that as a huge opportunity. Yeah, no, absolutely. So so look, lots on the docket. So we move quickly on tokenization is it''s not just a concept, really. It''s a it''s a process, right? A lot of moving parts. A lot of things have to come together. And so in terms of mechanics, Andrew, you''ve got your work cut out here, but perhaps you and Aaron could share this one. What are the what are the main steps involved in tokenizing an asset and who are the key stakeholders in the process? So I kind of think of it in three buckets, at least from kind of how to think about the topic. So the first one is the issuance kind of side of it. So where are you going to create the asset? What governing law? What structure? Can I write down this thing on the blockchain if I''m going to do it in a certain jurisdiction? So I think there''s a lot of questions around that. It''s kind of a very legal, heavy discussion interpretation of existing laws, et cetera. Then there''s distribution. So can I sell this thing in the in the place that it now might be called the security? It might be called something else and trying to understand what are the rules around that? Again, we live in a global market already today. So you might create something, you know, in location A and you might be selling it in a whole bunch of other locations, you know, B, C and D. So you have to think about, you know, that element. And then the last one is around the ecosystem. Maybe something for Aaron to comment on a little bit more, which is you need to have the right, you know, people that are also connected to the same infrastructure as you so that you can start to explore what to build. I think that one is quite important. Kind of something more the kind of newer entrants are really specializing in. Absolutely. I think the creation of a token in itself from a code perspective is fairly simple. How much investor protection can you get out of that is oftentimes a legal question that surrounds it and the structure around how it operates. And I think this is where certainly from a Libera perspective, we want to make sure that the asset that you say you own and the actual asset that exists is as close to it as possible. And the distance between those two being very, you know, one and the same is where you get the maximum amount of the benefit of all of the evolutions around consumer protection that we''ve come to come to realize. And I think this is this is where then then the next step happens, where now everyone understands what it is. Everyone understands what their rights are. Then it''s really about grasping the mobility of tokenization. And then this is this is what I think is is is real. The real kind of differentiator between regular traditional securities or traditional instruments versus what we have today in the sense that before, if I wanted to buy something, it''s a bilateral relationship between me and the person that''s selling it. I can''t do anything else with it. But as a token and being on a blockchain, the ability for it to be moved around, put on a lock through a smart contract that all of us can be able to do. So I think it''s a smart contract that auto releases all of this programmability around it is what I think, you know, really, really opens up the game. And that''s why, you know, back to, you know, James, what you''re saying, the 10x aspect of it is not really the fundamental. I want to buy something. I want to hold it. But really what you can do with it on top of just the exposure. So we get the issuers that create these assets, you tokenize anything, you''ll tokenize a family member if you were given the chance. I think that''s what meme coins are. I think that''s what meme coins are. And of course, on your side, the bullish, bullish group across the exchange across everything will just help distribute it. So of course, you then obviously need a safe place to keep it too. So custodians come in and their assets that trade on public blockchains. And so custodians like Zodiac need to make sure that they have set up for all of these assets that are incoming because of course their clients are saying, hey, you know, thanks for holding my Bitcoin, but I need you to hold this tokenized money market fund too. Any other points before we move on? So look, to summarize a little bit then, tokenize isn''t just digitization, right? It''s basically you create something of 10x of value and then the true goal has to be to reach a bigger market, right? I think that has to be one of the underlying reasons for tokenization. So moving on to the marketplace then and liquidity, which of course bullish, dominating in these days, what are the challenges in ensuring secondary market liquidity for tokenized assets? And how do you guys think about that? It''s been really interesting because there have been quite a number of panels going on this week around tokenization and being able to hear from some of the institutional players talk about those challenges has been great for my preparation for this panel. Yeah, absolutely. But I''d say one of the things that I''ve heard and I think it does resonate is a lot of the institutions are building their mostly private blockchains and they''re in siloed. So you have a situation where you have a lot of walled gardens and that creates just a dearth of liquidity, right? So if you have basically your own separate market on your own blockchain, that''s basically created this interoperability problem that leads to a lack of liquidity. And from what I do at bullish, I also look at a lot of our non exchange activities and what gets deployed into DeFi. And in this case, it''s really interesting to say, what is some of the technology and what are the things that we''ve seen to overcome challenges and interoperability? And how can could that be brought across into traditional institutions that want to tokenize? And over this past year, there''s been a huge amount of movement in the wrapped BTC and wrapped ETH. And what that is, if you''re not familiar with it, is a Bitcoin. So BTC can''t be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain and vice versa. So how the industry kind of overcame this problem was through these wrapped assets. And so you create a token. And if you take BTC as an example, because I think it''s most relevant to institutional players, you custody the token. So it''s not a peg. It''s the actual one to one backing. And then you wrap it and program it in a way that it can operate on that other blockchain. So if you move that across to institutions, you say, well, we have our walled gardens. We''re worried about KYC. We''re worried about this. We''re worried about that. You could program that all into a wrapper and thereby basically do the same thing that''s been done with the wrapped products and DeFi. And create liquidity simply by allowing the banks or trusted partners to interact with each other. And just by doing that, that''s one of the first things that you''re going to get to do to improve the market. Almost like a super aggregation effect. Yeah, absolutely. And I think that''s where I think the institutions need to start thinking about, you know, DeFi is not all scary. It''s not just AML and fraud. There are some real problems that we''ve had to face that can help the institutions adopt as well. And yeah, I think there''s that one. I think it''s how you start interacting with trusted partners in the industry as well. Also on the distribution side. So you find a liquidity provider, you find someone who''s licensed, and then you learn, okay, how can they interact with the other players? Yeah, nice. Andrew, any other further thoughts on the pain points? Yeah, I think liquidity is the main one. And I think for us, it''s been a good learning journey. Kind of as a traditional, let''s say, Web2 player looking out and discovering where these pools of liquidity may be in more of the public blockchain space, given that the stuff that we''ve tokenized is on the public chain. But I think increasingly, maybe from the discussions this week, it''s been interesting, more and more of them seem to be kind of in the opposite direction as well. If you want to diversify the liquidity pool, you look at where the balance sheet is sitting today on maybe the Web2 side, who is tokenizing those, whether it''s on private or kind of public permission, you know, kind of infrastructures and trying to start thinking, you know, how does that get bridged or wrapped out in a way into the other side? And that creates a healthier kind of set of flows. And I think for the traditional institutions, it''s probably an interesting topic for them this year to really think about given the ones that are sitting in the middle. Yeah, yeah. So I was actually watching Usman Khan, who''s CEO of our sister company, Zodium Markets, on the other panel. He also talked about how important liquidity was. I get it. I think that having a deeply liquid thing is something institutions always care about. But what about the demand side? Like, I think, you know, at the end of the day, people should want these assets too. We have experience, and this is an observation rather than a question to you guys, but we''ve seen these products built, assuming that there''d be huge demand. And that''s not always then been the case. And so we''ve built the connectivity, we''ve built the tokens at great costs, and then we sit there and go, okay, where''s the distribution? So anyway, interesting one. But in terms of... But I think with that, you also have, when you think about demand, like, not every product is going to appeal to everybody. Right. I mean, I was having a conversation this morning, it''s like, all right, sure, tokenized money market fund is fabulous, but if you''re a retail user, then like, whatever. Like, you''re not, you don''t need that to be tokenized. So I think part of it is... No. And you''re getting higher yield on other assets elsewhere. Exactly. So you''re not going to get the yield. And so I think also thinking about bullish as an institutionally focused firm, I''d say, I think it''s a much bigger play for on the institutional side with this than the retail. Yeah, yeah, nice. In terms of market makers and liquidity providers then, I mean, are they going to be the same names? Any thoughts on, is it just going to be LTP, Hidden Road, is it going to be the market makers that we all know, new names emerging? Institutions have to fill the void? They could, but I''d really like to see also just coming from the CeFi space. You have like AMM, so the automated market makers that have come in from CeFi that are newer to the crypto native space. How do you bring that again into TradFi? How do you start integrating the two where you have the expertise of the AMMs where it''s basically high end peer to peer? And that could also drive additional liquidity provision and almost decentralize it as well. Okay. Any other points on this one? Yeah, no, I think we do have to think about it with a little bit more of a forward view. I think, you know, solving for liquidity now is absolutely important. And all of the tools that we have, whether that''s from DeFi or from CeFi and employing them into that is important. But I think the real kind of breakthrough is going to happen when people who have grown up seeing that they can be a little bit more. Grown up seeing that they can control their own money with their own wallets by themselves, not like how their fathers or grandfathers or grandmothers and grand, you know, forefathers did. And realize that they want to control their money, but they want to do that and grow into other traditional assets that you could only previously buy through a central counterparty and want that in your form that you are comfortable with. I think that''s when that revolution is going to happen to really grow that business. So until then, there''s going to be pockets of in every evolution. It doesn''t all happen big bang with everything that goes on. But slowly, I think these are things that are coming into place and people are recognizing that. So the landscape certainly is very different from what I looked at this even two, three years ago. Yeah, nice. So moving on to custody then, and this is quite weird for a moderator to be asking questions about you guys, about what we do. If you want us to ask you questions back. No, no, no, that''s fine. That would be way too contrived. So let''s not do that. Let''s start first then with the differences of risk between a native digital asset and a tokenized asset like a money market fund. Are the risks the same? Are the holding risks the same? What do you think, Andrew? I think this can be a very deep discussion. At a higher level, I would say... We''ve got 12 minutes. I think you have different types of tokenization. So if you really dig into some of these structures, the token can mirror, the token can be part of, or the token is the register of the asset. And I think depending on which bucket you fall in, the nature of what you''re going to be doing with the custodians, how your smart contract functions, some things you might need to think about around risk will be different. But I think maybe an interesting point from an EBS perspective is that we have structured assets across all three. Some of it is legal in nature. Like if in Switzerland, for example, it is possible to maybe do something more digital native versus in kind of other more common law jurisdiction, you have to do something a bit more kind of as a hybrid. So could some of your tokenized assets actually be better instruments as well then? I think in Switzerland, the ledger based securities framework allows for these types of things, but it does take kind of, again, back to the ecosystem point, a lot of pieces have to move together. And it really depends then on what the client demand is. I think as we get more and more into the space on tokenization, people will start asking those questions as to what we could do when you start looking under the hood at a little bit more detail. Yeah. Yeah. Because I guess one of the problems we got as a custodian level that I was just saying like, well, hold on a minute. If you''re holding an asset that ultimately if I lose by accident, then I can just phone Aaron up and put a line through that line of assets that I''ve lost and he''ll create a new one for us. So the risks aren''t the same, like, you know, the fact that we''ve got insurance to cover, cover losses and stuff like that kind of irrelevant. And so just interesting to see then how we, we, we survive in an environment like that. No, but I mean, I, sometimes I, I try and compare like, you know, where we talked about private chains, public chains, and obviously, you know, from a Libera standpoint, we''re very much, you know, public chain infrastructure. I always say that we''re trying to create very safe cars that run on public highways rather than trying to lay my own roads to go from A to B. And in that kind of analogy, how I see custodians is that, yes, you can park your car on the side of the road and hope that nothing happens to it. Or you can put in a garage that is safe and, you know, it''s professionally managed. And I think that definitely has a space and it''s not just about because, you know, the, the, the risk of the asset itself, it''s varied for sure. But even for the most secure of them, quote unquote, I think there''s a different place for it from a garage perspective. And it''s definitely something that we want to, want to encourage and want to have because that brings with it other, you know, utility around keeping that in the garage. Yeah. I mean, speaking about keeping things in the garage, we, we work together on quite a few initiatives. And it''s fair to say that it''s a, it''s been a learning process, right? To, to, to bring all the parties together, to get the demand side, the issuer side, all talking to each other. Forgive my only cringey type question, but in terms of, in terms of how digital asset custodians like Zodia needing to adapt for RWAs, like how have you seen them do that? I mean, obviously you speak to other custodians too, that''s fine. But, but what are the main ways that you''re seeing that they''re helping you in your day to day? I think there''s, there''s always a question of kind of regulatory components on this question. You know, where do you sit from a regulatory perspective on the crypto side or the security side? But I think, you know, going forward, a lot of that is actually going to become one. And so lots of jurisdictions are recognizing what it is for what it, what it should be and going really back down into the fundamentals, which is great to see. From a, from, from a Libera perspective, we, you know, absolutely working with, with, with custodian partners, making sure that their clients have access to the tokens that we bring to market is, is, is absolutely critical. And that''s also part going back to the distribution question as to people who have access should, should be, should be, should be, will legally have ability to have access, should have access and making that available in the safest possible way is something that we absolutely promote. I think, yeah, no, maybe adding to that, I think custodians are absolutely critical to kind of the RWA picture. Some of the, but that''s not what you said just now. Exactly. No, I think, um, it may be in a slightly different role though. So, uh, for some of the kind of our recent tokenized funds that, that we''ve launched, um, we do just, you know, what we''re discovering, what''s maybe an interesting observation is we, we distribute it through custodial as well as non-custodial partners. And on the non-custodial distribution side, that kind of exposing us to a whole series of conversations with a number of custodians who are looking at the token, how to integrate it and seeing kind of what, uh, seeing what they could do kind of more as a strategic, you know, partner or a strategic kind of voice in, in the discussion. I think connecting, you know, custodian and the connectivity to different types of utility marketplaces, collateral marketplaces, et cetera, uh, has been something that I was a bit surprised going in. Honestly, it was not something top of mind, but it, it, it, you know, it becomes clear and clear that they kind of are providing that next layer of connectivity to some of the venues where this additional utility is ultimately going to be. Yeah. And I think that collateralization piece is really key. Um, so whether you''re talking tokenization or even if you''re talking about, um, traditional financial players, just as servicing clients who want to trade in digital assets more broadly, it''s how do they even know, are they allowed to custody their own assets? Do they have to go through a partner? Right. Is it different as we were saying earlier, if you''re custodying something like BTC or versus if you''re doing a, you know, tokenized money market or ETF. So there''s a lot there where once you get into the collateralization, then again, if this, uh, industry does take off, then creating margin, how you distribute that, how you allow people access to it and to trade on it. Um, the, the custody piece becomes really, really key. Nice. Okay. Um, five minutes left. Uh, we''ve got to do a, uh, a regulation question. That''s the right team. Um, so compliance person. So yeah, exactly. This is actually in your wheelhouse as well. Um, many, many, many, uh, RWAs will be tokenized in the coming 10 years. Uh, we''re doing predictions later, but trillions of dollars coming in, in my personal view, um, getting regulation right is obviously critical. Um, how do we ensure that tokenized assets remain legally enforceable and client compliant across jurisdictions? And do you see like an alignment across regulators? Well, I think it''s a bit of a misnomer to assume that there''s going to be this global harmonization of all regulation. I mean, we don''t even have that in trad fi markets. So if we don''t have it in trad fi, then we''re probably not going to have it, um, in tokenized, uh, assets either. I think though that for example, the view that the Hong Kong SFC has taken where the risk is really with the underlying security and viewing the tokenization as an external wrapper. Uh, yeah, of course you have a certain amount of technology risk with that token is tokenized wrapper, but really the risk and the regulation that you want to have is based off of the underlying and then just creating what works to create the market as opposed to hindering it and stopping it from growing. Yeah, exactly. Cause these are regulators securities at the end of the day, right? The regulators want this all to work. They want it to play nicely. So, you know, the, the, the, all the correct conditions are in play for it to work. Um, any other points on the regulatory piece? Yeah, no, I, I, I, absolutely right. I think, I mean, going back to what I was saying as well earlier, um, protection of investor interest is where regulation kind of, you know, columnnates to, right? That''s, that''s the whole goal. That''s the whole goal. The, when we talk about securities regulation and how sometimes we complain about it, et cetera, is because they''re trying to protect the little guy. If we learn, and, and this has evolved over, you know, a hundred years of securities regulations around the globe. I don''t think tokenization or any type of, you know, technology nullifies that. In fact, it, it should reinforce a lot of the principles there. Um, and, and, and, and, you know, as Priscilla has mentioned, there''s not going to be a global rule that just, you know, gets everything, you know, checked off instantly. Um, but regulations are going to have to evolve to cater for something that doesn''t have to clear through a central counterparty in a particular country. And that can involve passporting, can involve, um, you know, recognition of different, um, aspects of it. Um, you know, cross regulatory, um, harmonization. A lot of things can happen and will happen. Um, but I think the fundamentals of the fact that protection of the little guy is the key, um, underlying actually is a great place to start. And, and I''m sure evolution of, uh, regulations will happen accordingly as well. I guess UBS cares a little bit about regulation too, right? So, uh, I would say, no, definitely. And I, but I think it''ll naturally kind of organically evolve. So I think every new asset that''s brought to market from the issuer and distributed in every new jurisdiction, it kind of gives both sides of that equation a chance to understand each other''s framework. So if you''re going to, you know, choose to distribute in, you know, a certain market, there are certain selling restrictions or rules or even digital assets, specific due diligence you might need to do. Uh, that would then get compared against the issuance kind of requirements on the other side. And I think this is how the regulators probably will start to learn across the markets as to what the combinations are. I think underneath it though, what we can control is maybe more on the smart contract standards. So I think for us, you know, we, we definitely find ourselves engaging more and more in these different, I think Aaron and the team as well, uh, you know, kind of certain standards that make it easier to kind of understand at least at the mechanism level, you know, what are we all trying to achieve or what are the buttons that one can press? Yeah. Super. Well, I think, um, it''s fair to say that we''ve breathlessly gone through the entire life cycle of tokenization. So I really hope it''s been super useful and we''ve got a minute and a half left and, um, you probably didn''t get this far, but here we are. Um, what, what, what is the biggest misconception you hear on a daily basis about tokenization today? Anyone want to give a shot at that? I think it''s painting everything tokenized with the same brush, right? Right. We''ve been having a very focused conversation up here on stage around tokenized financial securities. Right. And when you''re walking on the street, I mean, how many times have we heard, you know, oh, tokenized real estate and pick your city ABC versus deep in. Uh, there''s a really broad range, um, and understanding that there''s a lot of different things going on in tokenization, um, I think is a big misunderstanding. Yeah. And my one was, is that we''ve actually been doing this a lot longer than people think. Um, any, yeah, I mean, one of the things that I, I, I, and I, again, when I have these conversations, I kind of smile to myself, but there''s a, there''s also a, you have conversations with yourself. Oh, that''s, that''s, that''s another thing altogether. But, um, uh, one of the things that I, I, I, uh, I find is, uh, liquidity and mobility being confused. I see that happen a lot. Um, tokenization brings mobility to the asset, meaning that it can move from a place to place. Right. Liquidity and mobility are completely different concepts in the sense that liquidity is only derived when someone demands it and someone wants to, there''s a supply and demand for it. And people are willing to exchange for it. The fact that it can move more easily doesn''t necessarily mean that there''s going to be liquidity. And I think that''s one of the misconceptions that we see in the organization. Thanks, Aaron. Sorry, I''m not going to let you, let you go. 10 seconds left. One big bold prediction from UBS, please. What do you think? I think the kind of future of this market is, is going to be very interesting when kind of your distribution channel eventually is the wallet of the individual. Right. I think that''s going to, and the fact that you can control what''s inside the box versus needing to control the box itself. I think that that''s going to change a lot of different businesses. Look, thanks so much, everyone. I really hope that''s been useful for everyone. Please give a big round of hand of applause for everyone here. Thank you so much.', 'Thank you for joining us.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('5708da1c4a', 'Bitcoin: The Basis for a New Financial System?', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hello everyone. This topic is on Bitcoin and the new financial system. So with me is Samson, Adam and David. Do you guys just want to do a quick intro about yourselves and what you guys are working on right now? Who first? Me. Let''s go that way. Okay. My name is Samson Mo. I''m the CEO of Jan3. We''re a company focused on accelerating hyper-Bitcoinization. And that means accelerating the adoption of Bitcoin around the world. We work with governments, central banks, regulators, and we also developed a Bitcoin wallet called Aqua to spur grassroots adoption. Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream. And Blockstream works on all kinds of Bitcoin tech from software, layer two wallets, hardware wallets, and asset management around all Bitcoin-centric things. Hey, good morning. I''m David Hsieh, co-founder of the Babylon Protocol. So our protocol is on Bitcoin staking, how to take any Bitcoin holders, any Bitcoin to provide security to any proof-of-stake networks in the world. I''m also a professor at Stanford University. Thank you, guys. So we were just discussing backstage about the current cycle, how Bitcoin''s kind of been going through this sidestep approach. So consolidation, reprice higher, consolidation, the seventh one since the cycle low. So the volatility is kind of being compressed out of Bitcoin. And yeah, so we could just start with there, what your guys'' thoughts are on the current price action, and anything in terms of where you think we could be going in the short term. You want to go for it? Who wants that one? Yeah, I mean, it''s curious that there is a lot of buying that is transparent, that the market knows about. So the ETF inflows are some multiple of the Bitcoins mined every day. MicroStrategy and the other strategy companies doing a similar play are also buying, you know, two times plus Bitcoin mined per day. And of course, you''ve got, you know, the retail buyers who are dollar cost averaging and buying. And because the price is set at the margin, so that means somebody has to be selling. Now, if we were talking about last year, after the DeFi contagion and bankruptcies, there were some structural sellers who were sort of forced sellers, and miners who were restructuring or replacing fleets or going through a less profitable period. But I think all of that is behind us now. FTX is starting to pay out their dollars from selling Bitcoin ill-advisedly in the mid-20K range. And so, anyway, so clearly somebody is selling to match this. Otherwise, the price would already be moving upwards again. Yeah, so since September, as we were discussing, 1.1 million Bitcoin have been sold since September, October of last year. And it''s quite incredible to see that that amount of Bitcoin has been sold and the price has gone up 50%, around 60,000 to 100,000. And obviously, with Trump''s presidential win, that pinned Bitcoin on 100,000. And we''ve kind of been in this trading range, what, from about 91,000 to about 110,000. But it is quite incredible. And Samson, you''re an advocate for price suppression. And it''s so, as a volatile asset, that the volatility is kind of being stripped away. Yeah. Any thoughts on that? Any on that? Well, it seems like it''s some sort of price suppression. If you look at the price movement, we kind of peak, and then we stay steady and chop sideways. And it''s good. You could say it''s consolidation, but it just looks very manufactured. The very tight range in which we''re trading at just doesn''t look natural at all. And then, of course, you have dips when there''s something in the altcoin world forcing capitulation, and then we get pulled down with it a bit. But overall, I would say it''s okay. You just have to be patient, much like with the Bitcoin ethos. It''s about the long game. Yeah. You''re buying something to hold for long term, not something you''re trading daily. So I think it''s healthy to consolidate. And then usually after some consolidation, we''ll rip upwards. Yeah. No, I agree. So if we want to go into the corporate adoption of Bitcoin, so we could discuss the public companies that are buying Bitcoin as a treasury asset. I think we''ve had about 20, 25 announcements in the past few months of either thinking about Bitcoin as a treasury asset or actually doing it. And I think we should start with MicroStrategy. I think that''s the most talked about stock on the planet right now. And Adam, I know you''re an active trader on Mike''s strategy. And so you take a really close look at the price action with it. But what are your initial thoughts with it and anything with his strategy so far? Well, I think last quarter or so they did a lot of ATM selling, i.e. selling shares to fund buying Bitcoin and less convertible note selling where in the earlier half of last year, they''d been alternating a billion of ATMs, a billion of converts. And so I think people were kind of feeling it''s time for sub converts. And actually that was announced overnight. Yes. But they''re doing a two billion converts and they have a target in one of the earnings calls where they said they''re aiming for 1.3 times leverage. So about 30% debt ratio. Yeah. And I think you said at the moment it''s about 12%. So they''ve got scope to buy maybe about 15 billion of convertible notes to get to their debt target. But of course, they can also continue to maintain a debt ratio or leverage ratio while selling ATMs and selling more converts and maintain that target debt ratio. So they''ve got to assume they''re going to try and get past the 500,000 Bitcoin, which takes about 21,000 more Bitcoin. So I would assume they will achieve that in the next quarter. Yeah. For me and a lot of the people that I''ve spoken to, they''ve actually been orange-pilled on his Q3 earnings call back in October when he issued the 42 billion capital raise, the 21 billion of convertible notes and the 21 billion ATM issuance. And on the market cap at the time, I think it was like 80 billion. So it was like a 50% dilution on the stock. And on that day, which was really interesting, the stock went up, Bitcoin went down. And as we know, like dilution, that''s one of the worst things for investors. But for a mic trashy holder, that accretive dilution, that Bitcoin per share is something that we all kind of gravitate towards and why we''re such avid buyers of the stock. So I think that was the largest capital raise in finance history. So he''s kind of, I think he''s learning on the job and just to see how much the market can take in terms of dilution and how much capital he can actually accrete for the company. Right. Yeah. I mean, I think it does take some getting used to for people who are used to valuing stocks, that they would not want to see too much dilution very quickly. They''d want to see the dilution, the capital raised from dilution used to create new product lines and demonstrate enterprise value. But with the Bitcoin strategy, the enterprise value is realized the next day when they buy Bitcoin and put it on the balance sheet. And so really, the question is more, what do you think is the fair market MNav, like multiple of the asset value, either the value of the Bitcoin on the balance sheet compared to the market cap, which is currently around two. So based on historic average levels, I would say that is actually quite cheap for microstrategy terms. And personally, my gut feel and just some loose modeling is that is like long term sustainable because you''re just looking for once Bitcoin is like post-hyper Bitcoinization, where Bitcoin is fully deployed and maybe not going up very fast. Then the MNav on a company like Microstrategy, presumably dropped to one or some small multiple. And so the question is, how much Bitcoin can they accrete per share between now and 10 or 20 years? Can they double it? And given that they increased the Bitcoin per share by 73% last year, that doesn''t seem particularly difficult to do with an MNav of two. So I would say like three or even higher is probably still gives you a discount versus the long term achievable Bitcoin per share. Yeah, it''s quite incredible. And to see how the stock trades on any given day, as an $80 billion market cap, it''s like the top 10 most traded stock or the implied volatility on the stock outpaces any of the magnificent seven. So he''s like trying to integrate into all these different products. So obviously the preferred stock, which was his latest offering, which is a hybrid between the fixed income and equity. And then something I wanted to discuss with you guys is like as Bitcoiners to get that yield in a risk adjusted manner. So obviously with the fixed income product that he''s got, it''s an $8 dividend. So the dividend percentage is at the moment is given on an 8 or 10% basis. And I think we can see that people are running towards these kind of yield products. So what are your guys thoughts on yield? Obviously we, and staking, and obviously we go to David about that, but to try and find that kind of balance on a risk adjusted basis. I mean, in terms of what MicroStrategy is doing, it''s possible because you have, you know, even with those perpetual preferred shares, some kind of dividend and they have the ability to pay the dividend in class A shares. But in terms of a direct or native low risk Bitcoin return, it''s actually very hard to achieve a safe return on Bitcoin. And actually, you know, the bear market a couple of years ago was partly triggered by, you know, sort of risk taken while offering yield by a three arrows capital, Genesis, Gemini, BlockFi. Which all stems from that GBC premium. Right. So, I mean, it was basically the reason people were able to offer what was clearly unsustainable yields, but market them as sustainable is because they''re making their strategy was they will lend unsecured to hedge funds making directional bets, which is obviously a crazy proposition. And so it inevitably fell apart. But now in terms of what could be achievable in a low risk, I would say something in a region of 2 to 4%, but you have to be very, very careful how you do that to avoid bringing on like custody risks and things like that. Yeah. So David, with Babylon, if you could tell the audience about it and then just in terms of how you navigate with your staking product. Yeah. So the original concept of Bitcoin staking is the observation that staking is growing to be a very large industry in the proof of stake networks. It has a trust risk minimizing way of earning yield staking. So we want to bring the same trust minimizing capability for Bitcoin stakers to use the Bitcoin and log the asset to provide security and thereby earning the reward. So that''s the basic observation that the reason, one reason why staking is such an important development in the past few years is because of the trust minimizing characteristic of staking. Do you guys have any thoughts on that? Well, I mean, I think the question, I mean, there are some technical risks around sort of smart contracts and bridges and obviously staking will typically involve wrapped Bitcoin, which is effectively custodial or literally custodial in most cases. So that''s a kind of different risk. I mean, I think the custodians will be capable to secure the Bitcoin. But then I think the bigger question is where the yield comes from, which is a kind of Alan Farringdon kind of quote at this point, right? Which is, you know, in some of the other products, I think there are some altcoins out there repeating the Terra Luna formula, paying a high interest rate where the interest... So you would say, well, who''s borrowing at 20% or 40%? And the answer is nobody. It''s, you know, they''re just using pre-mined coins. So it depends per network what is done. So I don''t really know the details of all of them. But that''s, you know, a concern that if there is no borrower who''s naturally generating the return, there''s a question of, is that return long-term sustainable? Or is there a failure point where something bad would happen? So can I respond to these two observations? Very important observation. Yeah. So a solution to do the staking is to bridge the asset into a wrap Bitcoin type asset and then stick on the network. So I think one of the key technical innovation of our pro of the Babylon protocol is that it does not involve bridging. So there''s no bridging of the asset. It''s natively sticked on the Bitcoin chain and the collateralization, that is the so-called slashing, is done through cryptographic means without bridging to the other network. So that reduces the bridging or the custodial risk that Adam mentioned. So that''s the first thing. The second thing about yield. So here I think the focus is on providing security to proof of state networks. And security is a very fundamental and important use case for the network. So the yield is coming from paying for that security. So because we think that security is central to the long-term viability of a network, so we believe also that yield will be sustainable. I think there''s a lot of there''s really no need to look for yield. Yield is sort of a fiat concept that is paired with monetary supply growth. But if you''re thinking about Bitcoin as a new money, not just an asset, but a replacement for all fiat money, then you''re probably better off just hodling your Bitcoin because that will probably outperform any attempts at getting yield. If you look at historically all the problems that have been had, I''m not saying it''s not possible, but like Adam has touched on it, there are risks inherent to searching for yield. So my advice is maybe just hodl. Hudl. So then moving over to more of a macro discussion, looking at the current US administration, what are your guys thoughts on that? And then also any, as we were discussing prior, and you see any currency risk with the dollar index being quite strong, and also gold kind of pricing in a lot of uncertainty. So I think gold''s up about 12% this year. And that''s with US yields at like 5%. So it seems like the market is demanding gold. So yeah, what are your guys thoughts on just the current macro landscape? Hudl. Hudl. Hudl. Hudl. Hudl. I think gold is sort of an indicator that Bitcoin is going to move up. That''s sort of like the the boomer is understanding that something is afoot and we need a safe haven. That leads to the broader marketplace coming to that same understanding for Bitcoin, which is basically just newer gold, digital gold. but the Trump admin I think is better I mean it''s not ideal because he launched a meme coin but you have to take the good with the bad sometimes he did free Ross he did follow through on that promise and there''s no more aggression towards you know Bitcoin and crypto companies which I think would have continued under a Harris administration so you know cup is half full I would rather take the Trump admin and yeah meme coins which don''t really hurt Bitcoin because mean coins don''t compete with Bitcoin in any way you know if anything it''s a capitulation to Bitcoin saying we''re not even gonna make an effort to throw out techno babble and jargon and you know blockchain technology and we''re just a meme now so it''s sort of hyper shit coinization where it''s just about launching a token letting it fly and letting what happens eventually happen which is going down well I mean so that''s that right isn''t that sad hyper shit tonalization because Bitcoin is the first technology we should build on that right to improve technology no well I mean the the Bitcoin dominance index is growing a bit over the last 12 months I guess and it''s gone to like 40 to now just over 60 percent 60 yeah so over 50 percent up roughly so yeah I don''t know I mean I think it''s probably just because the the kind of insider gamification of of the kind of pump and dump phenomena has been compressed so it''s disillusioning the retail investor and so they''re they''re you know leaving or something so I think it''s anyway I think it''s an area where more is less and that''s that''s really what''s going on in terms of the u.s. I think the yeah as Samson said the the macro is good for having more favorable regulations and an SEC that is you know going to stop the choke point 2.0 phenomena where banks were trying to unbank Bitcoin companies and the regulators were just running interference and say you know if they if they create some regulatory clarity open for business I think that''s good and it also works internationally because regulators look at each other so you know there are there are regulators financial regulators in different countries like Singapore Switzerland UK US but are looking at each other for cues and so the US finally becoming more constructive I think will unlock ETFs and other ETF Bitcoin favorable regulations in other jurisdictions which you know helps access to Bitcoin ultimately and I think the other big news you know going back a little bit now before the Trump administration was the approval of the spot ETFs which unfortunately had to be forced through the courts because of the regulators trying to slow down adoption and I think that set the stage for you know the early stages of institutional adoption which I think is still you know it''s early stages and it''s the next wave yes so with the with the ETF holdings I think the the last filing of the 13 s over 30 percent of them in our institutional holdings which is I think gold ETFs is around 40 percent so they think they''re gonna we''re gonna start getting to even higher levels and but we''ve just seen the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund allocate to I bet the blackrock ETF that ETF hit 50 billion in AUM quicker than any other ETFs of all time but I wasn''t really around in 2004 when GLD was launched but a lot of people were saying there''s a lot of synergies between GLD and how the price of gold had a seven-year bull market to 2011 and these consistent inflows and I think as we were saying before that the basis trade is kind of unwinding and now the we''re now kind of seeing these net long positions and so I think yeah these constant inflows almost like the buyers of last resort now with this into with this bidding for Bitcoin so it''s just interesting to see who keeps buying these ETFs and we get them on a quarterly basis so did any of the filings like jump out at you or anything like that well I mean it''s sometimes you have to pick apart some corporate entities are actually you know maybe buying for some other market reason like they''re you know the market makeup or something or they''re holding it for clients but it it''s definitely interesting to see genuine like institutional buyers I think it''s still relatively early so blockstream we hired Sean Bill who''s a well-known hedge fund manager and pension fund manager and he was the manager of the first US public pension funds that put Bitcoin on its balance sheet and that that was achieved in 2021 but I think still now in terms of you know the allocation to Bitcoin asset class amongst pension funds and mutual funds is very low so the institutional adoption I think is more prop kind of so I think you know those pools of capital are extremely large and the allocation so far are very small so you know that adoption when it does come it''s a little bit slow because it you know they want to make a systematic analysis of their risks and so forth but I think that that''s coming in you know in the mid-future as well yeah the two things I''m looking for is that stablecoin regulation where tether already the third biggest buyer three month treasuries and I think if they were a sovereign they''d be like the 20th largest buyer and David Sachs has alluded to the stablecoins buying the US debt to get their yields low and then the other one is the one is the SA B121 where they can start to hold Bitcoin in custody and have it on the balance sheet and so those are the two things that I''m looking at there''s a few banks now that are looking at custody like offering custody solutions and I think the ETFs are a big game changer I don''t think the implications of the ETFs is fully realized yet previous Bitcoin bull runs we''re usually kind of muted because of exchanges needing to onboard and their backlog for months so they cannot KYC people fast enough but with the ETFs now there is no barrier to trad fi capital flowing directly into Bitcoin and we haven''t seen that torrent of capital pouring yet Adam is saying they''re just dipping their toes in you know the sovereign wealth funds are just allocating a droplet of what they have but you can see that it is all coming and when you combine that with the macro trends of miners not needing to sell Bitcoin because they can finance they can borrow like micro strategy and then you have the micro strategy and all the other mini micro strategies buying more than the mine supply and then the ETFs themselves it just sets the stage for a massive wave of maybe 10 20 years of bullish green candles well I think it''s interesting you mentioned gold as a comparison because it''s probably the sort of most logical target for capital reallocation to Bitcoin especially for like ETF buyers they''ll talk to their broker or their financial advisor and say they want to take a stake in Bitcoin so the question is going to be you know this is new capital not you know it''s existing capital rather from their portfolio right so the question but what do you want to sell what do you want to sell so they''ll sell their gold allocation and buy Bitcoin so I think the proportion of gold value that is in ETFs is a lot smaller percentage wise than Bitcoin so I think and prices set at the margin so I think an interesting metric could be you know value bleeding from the gold ETFs into Bitcoin ETFs and you know potentially even in this market cycle starting to take the shine off gold and you know if that phenomena picks up steam people will switch you know to jump on board if they see the capital flight well if you look at gold ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs Bitcoin ETFs are outperforming gold and actually all ETFs from BlackRock the Bitcoin one is the most successful one ever yeah so the trend is pretty clear that Bitcoin is starting to dominate again yeah no I agree and then we''ve only got a minute or so but I just want to get your views on just the fundamentals of the Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs and Bitcoin ETFs are outperforming gold and actually all ETFs from BlackRock the Bitcoin one is the most successful one ever so in terms of Like I said before, they don''t need to sell Bitcoin anymore, at least the bigger ones, and if they''re public. But the sovereigns, the nation states that are mining Bitcoin, they''re very price insensitive because it''s their power. And you can even build new power installations just to mine Bitcoin with stranded energy. So the entire dynamic has changed massively in terms of mining. And this is probably why we see Hashrate just piling on nonstop, because they''re not really worried about paying for electricity anymore because it''s behind the meter. And I don''t think that''s fully priced in yet. I think there was a bit of a structural thing going on from the bull market a couple of years ago where people overbought miners on pre-orders, and it ended up taking a couple of years until they received the last of their order batches. And so then they found that there wasn''t enough power to put them online. And so because you''ve got all these enterprise buyers with a sunk cost logic, they''re going to put it online if it reduces their loss. And so I think that''s why the Hashrate has been a bit high and suppressed the mining profitability, which otherwise would be roaring at this stage in the market. Right. So I think it recovered, obviously, because the price is a lot higher now, even factoring in the halving, dropping the supply. Of course, the fees aren''t carrying their weight, but I think that''s just due to kind of cycles in the market of different demands for block space, pushing out other uses and then subsiding themselves. Perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.119', NULL, 'https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-protocol-village-bnb-48', '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');
INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('hong-kong-hub', 'Hong Kong: Transitioning from a Global Financial Hub to a Global Web3 Hub', '香港金融管理局代表', ' Panel Discussions', ' Hello, everybody. My name is Casey Lau. I actually do this kind of thing for a living. The last time I was in this room, we had Rise here in 2019. So it''s very exciting to be back here. I was at ConsenSys in Austin last year. And I got to say, the first year event here in Hong Kong is quite a big turnout. What do you guys think? Awesome. Yeah, right? Very exciting. So Hong Kong is back. I hope everybody gets a chance to look around Hong Kong while you''re in town. Check out some of the restaurants and nightlife. It''s very, very exciting. I understand 75% of the audience here over the next two days is from out of town, from out of Hong Kong. So it''s great to have you all here and check it out. So this panel we''re talking about, it''s about Hong Kong transitioning from a financial hub to Web3 hub, which I think is a very exciting conversation to have. And I have three amazing panelists that will get down to the business. One is from the government. One is from institutional. And one is from the metaverse or whatever. So please, starting with you, Evan, let''s start. Why don''t you introduce yourself and your company? What do you do? Sure. I''m Evan L. Yang, a group president of Any Mocha Brands. We are born from the cyber port, shall we say, right? So we''re one of the companies native to Hong Kong, native to Web3. We are known to be a prolific investor. But we essentially, we''re an investor, we''re an operator, and we''re an advisor at the same time, right? So our innovation pillar in the business operations allows us and gives rise to our ability to invest into now 540 companies, which then gives rise to our skill set and actually being able to advise, almost like a Goldman Sachs of Web3. So we bring projects that have digital asset aspirations to market, right? I, myself, came from a TradFi background initially. So I was at Bankers Trust in a city group in derivatives. And then I was at McKinsey for a number of years. And then I ran KMB, the county motor bus company, however, in Hong Kong, for profit bus company. And then GLG, which is an expert network firm, for a number of years. And I''m in Animal Group brands for four years, right? Which, if you count the dog years, that you should multiply by seven. So I''ve been in crypto for 28 years. So that''s how it feels, right? And this morning, you announced the exciting stablecoin year. So we''ll talk a little bit about that later on. King. Yes. Again, great to be here at ConsenSys. Finally, it''s happening. And you must call for those guests from overseas. We are 100% Hong Kong government''s department. And we are here to serve all of you. In fact, we are the relationship managers to help you succeed by connecting you to the capital, the various government funding, potential clients, the major institutions in the financial side, other major corporations. So this is what we do. Now, at the same time, the other hats that we wear is essentially to try to promote via this mining platform. So I see my colleague Jane here. So again, the Dysamia Festival. For instance, it''s a major platform for the various startups across different sectors. Another flagship event is the Hong Kong Fintech Week that we do in November. So these are essentially some of the platforms that we do together with collaboration, like ConsenSys, that we do marketing. And last but not least, we also work very closely with the policymakers, the regulators, essentially try to collect market intelligence to feedback what the market needs. So that''s what we do. So that''s what we do. I had a panel this morning talking to three startups who have all either been born in Hong Kong or came to Hong Kong. And one of them had nothing but high praise for InvestHK. She was from Taiwan. So InvestHK made it very, very easy for her to come to Hong Kong to start her Web3 business. So that was, I hope everybody from InvestK heard that. It was very good. And finally, Eddie. Hi, everyone. I''m Eddie Lau. Our firm is called Ata Tefen. We are listed in Hong Kong. So you can find a lot of information about us on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange under Stock Ticket 279. So we are a hybrid. We call a hybrid financial service. We''re actually one of the most licensed companies in Hong Kong. So we''re brokerage business, asset management, custodian, money lending, whatnot. Most importantly, we actually are authorized to do it in virtual asset. So meaning we can mint STO. We can trade cryptos. We can do on-off-ram, meaning converting fiat to stablecoin or vice versa. We can advise people on projects. We keep custody of tokens for our clients. Obviously, we also have traditional assets, which is a bigger part of our business. We also have a team that is technology-driven. So the team is everywhere. Some of them are in Toronto and some of them are in Hong Kong and Beijing. That team is part of Ata, where we participate in the Hong Kong Monetary Authority Project Ensemble Project, which is the Hong Kong blockchain infrastructure project. So our job is quite simple. I don''t know how long it will take. But our goal is to bring in, basically bring tokenized money together with tokenized assets. And also you''re on something called the Web3 Task Force? Yes. It''s an honor to be on that task force. It''s like an action movie, but it''s not. Well, there are 15 of us. I mean, Andy Mocha, actually. Yasu is on the committee as well. So we are very honored to be invited by the government to provide advice, meaning we push them quite hard to innovate, and they do. Okay, great. Okay, so for the audience, I want to kind of give a little context on Hong Kong. So 2024 was a big year. We''ll get into what 2025 looks like. But maybe starting with Evan, what was something in 2024 in Hong Kong''s Web3 scene that you thought was a highlight that kind of paving the way for 2025 and beyond? Well, you know, to talk about 2024 and even 2025, we would talk about sort of what happened in 2022 and 2023, which were very tough years, right? So 2024 actually began a little bit as a resurgence of sort of like the Web3 interest. It started with Game 5, which is sort of where we have been. And that wave sort of lasted four to five months, and there was a bit of a dull period during the sort of summer months. And it came back again towards the end of the year after Trump was elected, right? So that was the year. I wouldn''t say that that was a great year, in fact, but it was a year of sort of like, hey, builders, you know, and applications coming to bear. AI started in a lot of ways, right? And if you remember, besides Game 5, there''s infrastructure, right? So a lot of layer twos, right, big layers, layer zero, right, actually launched. And then it was an infrastructure in Game 5 kind of a year. Ultimately, for Hong Kong, I would say that if you bring in the context of where Hong Kong has been, is that there are lots of, shall we say, thinking and regulating going on in the back, right, which was not that apparent to the general public. But if you were to look at sort of the industry feedback on Hong Kong overall, is that it''s definitely very thoughtful but a little bit conservative at the same time, right? So there was an additional virtual asset license, virtual asset provider license that was granted, and there was OTC regulation going on, and then stablecoin is going on. So, again, a lot of stuff happening in the back. But are we as fast as we are in sort of like, you know, in developing Hong Kong into Web3 Hub? No, we''re not, right? So we''re doing well, but we can be faster. So one of the most important aspects of Hong Kong being a financial center is having liquidity, right? And there''s tons of liquidity in the traditional finance space for us here, but we don''t have the liquidity yet for sort of what we call universal assets trading, right? So we''re in the early innings, right? We''re probably a little bit behind that of, let''s say, Singapore. U.S., as we know, is going to catch up a little bit. So we have a lot of work to do. Okay, great. King, I''m sure you have this all written out, what happened in 24, right? It''s when you go on your tours around the world to promote Hong Kong. What''s one highlight you think is something that you''re very proud of? Well, the one thing that we have to say is that the government has done a good job in connecting the dots. Okay. So it''s not the one incident. It''s the ability to really connect a number of things and try to do well. And now we''re seeing the fruits. If I may just quickly paint a picture. So naturally, I think for those of you who have been in Hong Kong, you probably have seen the news about things like, you know, FAM office. You probably have heard that. There''s another policy around the what we call CIES, right? The capital investment engine scheme. And then there''s the fintech. And there''s the wealth management. There''s the crypto. In most cases, most people that I talk to, they got a bit confused, right? Because there are different pockets. But if I may, try to connect these thoughts together, which is something that the leadership and government have done a fabulous job. Now, let''s start with the IPOs. Because a lot of times when people talk about Hong Kong, this almost goes about saying by comparing us against Singapore. But I have to say that for any business, capital always goes first. So that''s why we think about even IPOs. So last year, we had a decent year. Not the best year. We did something like, what, 70 plus IPOs. Raising, I forgot the exact number. But I did a map. Actually, the number of deals was like 60, 70 plus versus four in Singapore. But the money raised from Hong Kong through IPOs last year was over 330 times of Singapore. Wow. 330. Yeah. 330. So, okay. Now, so let''s park that idea. Number two, now guess what? A lot of these kind of companies, when they''re listed in Hong Kong, then they would naturally, some of the founders, they''d like to sort of mobilize and monetize those money, right? So this is where the private banking and the EAMs, the family offices, people would come to play to essentially help this almost like new wealth to find a home to invest. Now, at the same time, for those people who are in finance, you will recognize that in recent years, there''s a strong movement towards investing in alternative assets and the crypto being one of them, right? Now, so that''s why when we look at just the breadth of offerings in Hong Kong, it''s great because of all these new innovation going on, there''ll be more and more like tokenized assets. There are more choices, right, for this new wealth to deploy the capital. So the point I''m trying to get to is that it''s not just one thing. It''s all these things. Now we are seeing that all the dots are being connected. And as a result, the whole financial sector is now really far up. And then also the RWA''s organization is also helping the other sectors like the shipping, the supply chain finance. So even the non-financial sector are also benefiting. So it''s really the series of events that are now really elevating Hong Kong to the next level. All right, great. Eddie, how about you? Last year, what''s the one thing that you tell everybody when you go overseas how great Hong Kong is and what a great year it was last year? Or was it? You know, I think one thing about Hong Kong that''s special is that it''s slow but moving forward. Okay. I mean, I won''t name names, but there are places where they move fast and they regress. Or they move fast and then they regret. We''re not like that. I think Evan pointed out a very good point. VA OTC. How do you deal with stable cons? How do you go off-RAM or on-RAM? Without a good OTC regime? Absolutely important. We''re slower than the other places, but when they come out, you guys will like it. One thing that I find interesting and I think people may have ignored and it could be relevant to you all, is the fact that Hong Kong government have done a lot with the tax regime. Long story short, if you''re running a crypto fund here, you should be able to get money. Raise money for yourself. First of all, you survive. You don''t pay tax anymore. Just like when you manage a stock portfolio, you don''t pay tax. And more importantly, this is a good place where you have infrastructure. I mean, this topic is financial hub, right? So if you have been trading or running hedge funds or running family office money or multi-family office money, this is a great place for you to express your investment in a very efficient way. It wasn''t that efficient before, but it''s going to get more efficient. And I guess you can come back next year and ask me, but it will be so efficient next year, lots of fun will happen here in Hong Kong. Why is it getting more efficient? What is the catalyst here? Look at me. First of all, the money is here. So I''ll give you an example. I mean, this is probably rolling back time. So I started trading in 2001 in New York with UBS. I was trading derivative and convertible bonds, stocks, whatnot. Arbitrage here and left and right and center. Computer get faster. We run to HFT. So roughly 10, 12 years ago, we started running HFT and index arbitrage in Asia''s onshore China. Short the index, long the stocks, run a basket, collapse, and you make 15%. That was cool and new. Nobody understands what the hell we''re doing except they give us money. Where do you get the money? Hong Kong, central. People give you money. And guess what? Rolling forward, now it''s 2025. What do we do? In crypto, we can do HFT, cross-exchange arbitrage. You can do funding arbitrage. You can do volatility arbitrage. Momentum trading CTA. I''m sure some of you guys would know, may have invested in them. You guys are an expert in it. But what matters is this makes 20-something percent return when your try-find stuff is making 5 or 10 and sometimes negative. So why aren''t people doing more of this? Tax reason? KYC, AML reason? Yep. Or they just don''t understand it? And the technology infrastructure, the license regime, the fact that how we set up OFC in Hong Kong, the way that SFC regulates, make it so easy already. So it''s a matter of time rather than how. Okay. That''s a great segue into the question I want to ask you now. So this week''s big news is Animoca, Standard Chartered, a traditional bank, and HKT. You guys have signed formally a joint venture to release a stable coin, one of stable coins in Hong Kong. Now, is it because now it''s more fast? You guys are able to move quicker now? Or maybe you can talk the audience through a little bit, quick points of how it came together and what''s your vision for it this year? Yeah, no, this is one of the most exciting initiatives that Animoca is undertaking because we''re native Web3 companies heading to what we call the institutional side. But you look at the executive management team that we have, we''re actually very, we came from pretty traditional backgrounds, you know, and then we have the visionary Yat Seal who, you know, lead us into sort of like the exploration of the innovation that we have. But this is one innovation is how do we bring the masses of Web2 into Web3, right? That''s the key thing. So what we wanted to do here is sort of, we understood that the Hong Kong government, led by HKMA, wanted to get into this digital asset space via a regulated manner, right? So they were looking at CBDC and looking at stable coins. And we looked at the opportunity and we were like, what is the right combination that would really get the adoption, right? So we began speaking to Sash Hardard 663 days ago. Okay. So we counted it, right? And then now we have it signed, right? And we''re like, okay, with a native Web3 company partnered with a traditional bank, that''s a really good combination, right? And now, of course, you have HKT as well, which is a, you know, traditional operator that can get to the consumer level, right? So we feel that this is the right combination, which will bring the right regulatory rails into a stable coin, which already has good use cases, as we know. And if you look at sort of where Twitter''s reaction to it is once we posted it, you know, one reaction was this changes everything. Why does this change everything? It''s because this is the first time we have a well-known, you know, commercial bank that''s innovative with very strong emerging market reach alongside a equally, I guess, well-known Web3 player, globally known in this space, and working on it together, then you have a combination of that plus an operator that would make it real on the ground, right? So this entry is very, very significant, not only for Hong Kong, but really globally. Globally, exactly. So King, how does this kind of exciting news, global news, first of its time, help you to get the rest of the government on board and accelerate faster things that other companies need to move faster in this space? Well, again, as Eddie said earlier, the task force and different closed-door meetings, in fact, I think you really ask around. We have a lot of international guests. Sometimes I miss Hong Kong. We organize meetings with the secretary, the undersecretary, the regulators, and so on. We constantly got the feedback that the policymakers and regulators are as open, as welcoming as it gets. So the first point I''m trying to get to is that we are listening to what a market needs. Okay, that''s one. So therefore, the speed thing that Eddie referred to, we totally get it within governments. It''s just a matter of executing. So that''s one. But most specifically, relating back to the exciting announcement from Evan, is that we are getting so much interest, particularly from the mainland Chinese companies, that in the past two years, they''ve been really coming down. We''re just so busy every day. We are welcoming all these incoming mainland delegations. Now, you may ask why. Actually, many of these companies are setting up their international headquarters in Hong Kong. Now, one of the things that they''re also doing as one of the sort of positioning is to set up the corporate treasury center in Hong Kong to do things that may seem simple. They may seem simple. That is cash pooling, liquidity management, treasury stuff. But things like stable coins, things like the project ensemble, the totalized market funds are now really getting these CFOs super excited. Yeah, great. Because they can now, wow, great. All these companies, many of them are manufacturing in Asia. They have different factories and supply chain partners, clients, literally around the world. So you can imagine the complexity for moving money in and out. Now, with stable coins, they can drastically cut down the B2B, right? The B2B money movements and also lower costs. Now, at the same time, you can imagine as a treasury guy, then if you have the digital money, be it the totalized deposits, or disabled coins, or CBDC, you have the digital money to pay for the on-chain assets in the form of things like totalized money market funds. So they can even manage the cash and get some extra yield much more efficiently. So that''s why many of these firms, again, we''re talking about like tens and hundreds of them and thousands of them coming from China to Hong Kong, they are really bringing the liquidity as well by parking the treasury in Hong Kong. So that''s why we''re just getting so excited. So now that we''ve got stable coins, we''ve got all these things, then we are really moving to the next level. Okay, that''s great. Okay, so Eddie, for 2025, is it stable coins, tokenizations, or the connection with the mainland that you''re most excited about? Well, actually, you know, most of the things I want to say, so I''m just going to add on what you say. I think for the audience here, I mean, I guess you''re here because either you''re interested in cryptos or you''re in finance and you want to learn about digital asset. Somehow this is kind of the future. So that''s 2025 or 26, 27, what should I do with this? My personal view on this is somehow Hong Kong had this, I don''t know whether it''s luck or by design, had this vision of building kind of everybody welcome infrastructures. It''s not there yet. It''s not even that obvious. But the project ensemble, what the regulator are doing, the government is doing, means that folks like Sarah Charter, which is a relatively traditional bank, which means that all of you, with a job that is relatively traditional, be selling bananas or apples, transferring money to Southeast Asia because you bought a better rice, can become relevant to tokenizations. I know that connection is hard to make, but I highly encourage you to participate into the Hong Kong project. Again, not obvious, obvious. But when you see tokenized asset coming out, please get involved. You buy one, you have a wallet, you trade one. it''s not perfect product on day one, but the power of smart contracts, the power of digital ID, and the fact that the public sector, the traditional banks, amazing companies that are innovative, like Animoca, us, a listed company with both TriFi and digital asset licenses, all of us are building somehow an ecosystem where everybody can get involved. I think that should be relevant to the audience here. Would it become the most dominating economy here? I think so. Because I think one distinction between Hong Kong and Singapore, I mean, I can''t help, but I have to bring out the name of Singapore, but Singapore is the center of Southeast Asia in a way for financial service, less so with commodity trading because Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand have their own economy. Hong Kong have mainland China and this mainland China cross-border flow just between Hong Kong and mainland and China versus other country means that what we''re building here is going to be so relevant to all of you. It''s going to be so widespread. And I think adoption ultimately is what people are looking for and you''ll be one of those who adopt it hopefully. And the adoption rate will be so high in two to three years in Hong Kong maybe a stable call, maybe tokenized deposit, maybe CBDC, maybe a tokenized real-world asset, God knows. But what matters is you''ll be using some of it. That would be the biggest prediction, I think. Okay, great. That''s awesome. Okay, I want to segue with kind of what you were talking about. I want to talk about Singapore because a lot of people, I think, from the U.S. that are in town or from Europe don''t understand the rivalry between Hong Kong and Singapore. It''s been there for many, many years, many decades. Definitely during Web2, a lot of the startups competed with each other who had the better investor scene, who had the most unicorns, things like that. You know, the biggest show in Singapore that will compete against ConsenSys is Token 2049. I think everybody knows and has been to that event. That used to be in Hong Kong, right? The founders are from Hong Kong. They moved over there because of the pandemic. I don''t think we''re going to get them back. The F1 is quite an alluring thing to be on top of. But we have ConsenSys, we have Web3 Festival, we have the FinTech Week, we have all kinds of great stuff. So I want to talk, like, Evan, you know, what do you see are some of the challenges and the benefits between Hong Kong and Singapore for building Web3? I know it''s a big conversation, but maybe pinpoint on one thing that you see because you guys have offices there as well, but you retain headquarters here in Hong Kong. What''s the allure here between us and Singapore? Well, I mean, you know, besides the fact that, you know, we are born and raised in Hong Kong, really, Hong Kong is a, sorry for Singaporeans out there, is a much more credible financial center. Okay, that''s good. Right? And then the quantity of talent that you see and the geographic location being in the smack middle of Asia makes a huge difference. We''re in the same time zone. Yeah. But if you sort of look at what we''re trying to build here, you are trying to leverage a bit of financial talent, which there''s plenty here, which can give rise to the FinTech space. That rail that we''re trying to build here, you can get the talent here, right? The tech talent, China, right? Some of the best talent in blockchain actually comes from China, right? They might be more on the private side or the more regulated side, which works for Hong Kong ultimately, right? If you go back a little bit to what we talked about, you know, leveraging what we talked about in the stable coin, what''s the purpose of us being here in the first place, right? So AnyMoka really, our entry into Web3 is founded upon the philosophy that the internet needs to be democratized, right? What does that mean ultimately? Data is not democratized today. Yes, there''s open access to the internet, but whatever you create comes back to you in forms of advertising. It''s not free. You might be manipulated and all of that. What we''re doing with decentralized ID via Mochaverse, via reputation layer, is the century of peer in the future about what the internet ought to look like, right? What does stable coin itself symbolizes as we enter it? It stands for, to us at least, that the banking system, the banking rails, in light of geopolitics, needs to also be neutral, right? Because at the end of the day, we know we''re under the SWIFT system, the US dollar system. Nothing wrong with that as long as geopolitically, we''re all friends. Now, are we all enemies? We''re not all enemies. We''re certainly not where we are 10 years ago. Right. So what you need is a 24 by 7 neutral, you know, crypto rails on public chains, right? That''s what you need to spur the adoption of financial system that will propel itself forward, right? The banking rails itself is old, okay? But it''s not that it doesn''t work. It works, but some elements of it need to be modernized. So where do you go? What''s the entry point, right? You definitely want 24 by 7 programmable atomic settlement money. That''s what you would want to go to. The banking side, even a bank that is as venerable as Santa Charter would go into it. But for us as NEMOCA, what we would like to see is ecosystem building, right? So you have to have that. The philosophy is what drives us forward, right? And then if you do the right thing, then your revenue as a profit should naturally flow in. That''s what we believe in. Yeah. Great. Awesome. King, you know, we''ve had some big crypto companies here in Hong Kong. Just as we were talking before, Amber, Nansen, they all started here. They eventually moved to Singapore. Do we try to get them back or do we just work with InvestHK to bring the new generation in or, you know, alleviate the ones that are here now? Well, first of all, on record, Amber, they are here. There are people in Amber. Amber people here. Okay. In fact, I''ll be going to the Amber party tomorrow night. Okay. Okay. Now, again, we know most of these players, the Nansen and so on. There was this, like, temporary situation from COVID that Singapore opened up like a year earlier. So that basically shifted a lot of the media focus that, oh, Singapore are getting a bit of these companies from Hong Kong. But guess what? A lot of these, the fam offices, the high net worths, you know, the companies, they are slowly moving back. Yeah. Some of them quietly, but we see, we see a whole landscape. Yeah. Now, of course, there are just so many of the, the hard facts I can go to. But like, in terms of time, I like to go a different track. I like to go on the intangible side. Now, I just want to sort of hear from the audience. By the way, who have you seen the movie Four Trails? Or maybe the video on YouTube, Four Trails. Okay. Now, I think if you have not, I highly encourage you to just find Four Trails on YouTube. And they''ll blow you away. Now, the reason why I like to use this as a way to sort of like give you like a different, different angle is because in my work, I''m just super grateful that Invest Hong Kong hired me to allow me to have this kind of exposure to see a lot of really smart people around the world. For most people who have been to Hong Kong, there''s some kind of magic in which it''s almost like love at first sight. People will be like, oh, I love Hong Kong. I like the hiking trail. I love the food. I love the Thai Pai Dong. There''s a special love to it. So that''s why when a lot of people move to Singapore during the pandemic, most of them are not by their own will. It''s just by necessity. Right? The school and everything for the kids. But now they''re coming back because they feel that this is a place that they love and enjoy their lifestyle. And we''ve been seeing that over and over and over again. So don''t listen to me. Just watch the four trails. There are literally a lot of expatriates in Hong Kong. They have run the trails and they have filmed the video, put it on YouTube before it became a cinema, a radio movie. And actually, guess what? A lot of these kind of viral activities happen in Europe because I happen to know some of the people running in the four trail video. And one of them is a CEO from Switzerland. His peers back in Switzerland saw the video. They''re like, wow, this is a different side of Hong Kong I''ve never seen. I have to see that. So they flew to Hong Kong just to experience the other side of Hong Kong and they love it. They decided to stay. So that''s the side that I want more people to listen and experience it besides all the hard facts that we are all so proud of. Okay. It''s called Four Trails. Four Trails. I''m glad that you''re watching YouTube in the InvestHK office. That''s awesome. I''ll watch it tonight. Watch it tonight. Yeah, I haven''t seen it either. I haven''t seen it either. Eddie, you are based here in Hong Kong but you travel the whole region of Asia. You''re in mainland, you''re in Southeast Asia, you''re in Japan and you just told me you speak fluent Korean and you love New Jeans and Blackpink a lot. So from that perspective, why don''t you tell us what you think of between Hong Kong and Singapore because you''re able to look at it maybe more from a holistic viewpoint instead of just between the two countries themselves. Just to make it clear, I don''t even have time to watch a movie so I''m traveling for work. Not for fun. I wish I''m trying for fun. We travel around the region because we have clients around the region. We have customers. What do they do with us? Guess what we are good at? Financial service. Capital market. People need money. People want to exchange money. People want to make investments. What''s the right way to put it? I think if you''re in crypto trading, so there''s somehow media focus around crypto people, crypto natives moving to Singapore and they have a lot of coverage around it and they ignore probably 98% or 99% of the rest of the population. They don''t cover them. So if you''re a crypto native trading cryptos doing DeFi, meaning DeFi, you know, stake, you lend and whatnot, maybe Singapore is just likely better today and here might work in 18 months time, Hong Kong regulation will catch up and you''ll be doing your DeFi here as good as in Singapore and I don''t see any reason why they don''t come back. So apart from the DeFi people, you''ve got a bunch of people who do on-around business. Guess what? We have stable cons. We make this Hong Kong dollar version regulated. We also have, you know, accepting like, you know, we have regime VAOTC that deal with unregulated tokens, so-called. USDT, USDC, you know, FDUSD, any stable cons out there. So, how can we be not the best place to, for someone with crypto to go into the banking systems? Legitimately. With KYC, AML, KYT, with a perfect regulatory regime. This is like going to training. Sorry, I''m a bit overweight, so I need to lose weight. Trust me, if I go to gym every day for three hours, I assume I don''t have to do my full-time jobs, you know, I will have time to go to gym. For after one month, I can play very good football. This is where the banking system is today. It''s an overweight banking system. They need to go to gym, need to be training up on how to deal with cryptos. How do you understand? When someone presents at USDT, you don''t stop them because they are proper people. They earn it in a proper way. So, give it another 12 months to 18 months and what happening with Anymocha, with Audi and all those stable cons are awesome because you''re training the banks, you''re training the regulator to accept basically digital currencies. So, these are the two reasons why generally, a crypto guy will come to me and say, I''m in Singapore. And trust me, in 18 months time, they''re sitting right here with us. Right, yeah. If not 24 months. Last but not least, the reason why we travel is that, guess what, if you, there are three reasons why I travel and three reasons why they talk to me. Hey, Eddie, I have a project. I want to tokenize it. As a matter of fact, sometimes, can you sell stocks, which is a tri-file product, along with tokens that''s regulated? Absolutely, Hong Kong is welcome. By the way, if I can''t sell a token, at least I can sell the stocks. Be public shares or public shares. So, the power of capital market here is tremendous because ultimately, people just want the capital. And Hong Kong is, in a way, better than Singapore. I remember there was a discussion, sorry, I ran out of time, but exactly 10 years ago when the Hong Kong Stock Connect was there, there were a bunch of hedge funds trading China stocks saying that they want to be in Singapore. And while others want to be in Hong Kong, guess what, the Hong Kong one absolutely outperformed. AUM is better, performance better because they''re closer to the company. So, you''ve got to be in here in the right market to raise capital. But finally, last but not least, I mentioned tokenized money, I mentioned security tokens, I also mentioned all of RAM. I want to highlight the fact that the government becomes so embracive and things are happening around all this institution that basically make up the whole economy of digital asset. The kind of integration between TriFi and DeFi or digital asset, we won''t have time today to go into deep dive into it, but trust me, this is moving so fast. When I go down to Singapore, I don''t feel it. Okay. Great. Okay, I''ve got a bunch more questions for you guys, but we''re running out of time. So, let''s give a round of applause to the panel here, but also thank all of you for being here to learn more about Hong Kong. Invest HK''s booth is right over there. Evan and Eddie will be out here to take questions over here afterwards. Thank you. Also, Annie Mocha booth over there. Oh, Annie Mocha booth over there. Eddie, where''s your booth? Next year. All right, great. A lot of free drinks. Thank you. Oh, scary photo. Yeah, we should do a photo.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('hong_kong__whats_next_for_regulation_', 'Hong Kong_ What’s Next for Regulation_', '未知講者', ' Panel Discussions', ' Music Alright, we have here a full house of people, many of which it''s their first time in Hong Kong. And walking around last night, people were wondering about the crypto rules in Hong Kong. And we have here the head of the SFC, Hong Kong''s market regulator, to help explain them to us. Alright, so in a nutshell, how do the rules work here in Hong Kong? First of all, it''s great to be here, great to see a lot of people, the native crypto people from all over the world. And I only learned that Sam, you''re here in Hong Kong for two months. So, all welcome. How do crypto rules work? Now basically, if you look at our regime for crypto, it''s very similar to the securities regime that we administer and enforce, because they''re meant to be very similar. We reckon that very early on when Bitcoin and all the other cryptos are being traded, that it cannot really fit into our securities regulation. It can''t cover, we can''t actually set the rules for them if it''s not fit into our definition. And so we created a bespoke, but at that time, a voluntary regime to govern the trading, the custody of assets, and which later became the legislation and got passed in June of 2023. And since then, we have licensed 10 digital assets trading platform, including the last one last night that Tom was talking about. And then we have another eight applicants which are under processing. Now, this is about trading platforms, but we are now providing, assisting the government, the financial services and treasury bureaus to put out a public consultation on two important market players, intermediaries in this ecosystem, which is the custodian and also the OTC dealing. Now, you''re aware that we also have licensed brokers and fund managers. We enable them to deal in or issue crypto related products and deal in those products by imposing some obligations on them when they are dealing with, particularly interfacing with the public. And in this, we expect that there will be a full regime covering all the ecosystem. Okay, great. So why though this approach? Because in the case of Hong Kong, it''s applying securities rules to crypto. And some might say that crypto is so unique, you shouldn''t do that. But Hong Kong has. We believe in innovation, but responsible innovation. And we believe that innovation and regulation should go hand to hand and reinforce each other for the proper development of the ecosystem and the industry. And as regulator, like how we regulate stock market and stocks, then we, it is also, we provide what we call the three C''s. That is clarity, certainty and consistency. Now, we also, earlier on, we said that we, we have licensed brokers and licensed banks who actually obligated, have undertakings when they deal in this. We also believe in moving the, promoting the institution to deal in this, to move into this space. That is, we are also promoting consensus. No, I''m actually advertising for you. I''m convergence. The other consensus. Convergence, which is a false C. And with the participation of institutional players, TREDFI, you actually get compliance. Because they are very, they are as in the traditional industry, are concerned with AML and other safe custody of assets. And they also benefit from, from this convergence by extracting efficiency. Because as we all know, we also believe that blockchain is, with appropriate safeguards, would actually help extract efficiency in clearing and settlement. So both, both sides win. Right. So how do you see then Hong Kong''s role within Asia? Because some might say that Singapore competes with Hong Kong. Is that the case? Or are they separate jurisdictions as far as the markets go? Well, we, we always compete. We compete with any cities. And the landscape for crypto is actually very polarized. Meaning from, if you look at the degree of intensity of regulatory scrutiny actually spread all over the spectrum. From the very, very light touch to prohibition in the case of China. And, and in between you have, you have Hong Kong, you have Singapore, you have US, which is also suffering, despite the capital flows and the products that they are offering, they''re also suffering from fermentation in oversight. So, in, so in, in that sense, actually, we actually need more, more harmonization of these standards. Because liquidity tend to move from a tight, tightly regulated to a very light touch. And this sort of fermentation in regulation as well as liquidity is actually not helping the industry. Because it will add to the compliance costs. It will also, for, for us regulators there, the, the, the, the efficiency of the price discovery is not there. If you have very fermented liquidity pool. So, if you ask me, I think we are seeing more of a alignment in the approach. You, you''ve seen the SEC is moving towards bringing clarity to the regulation, which has been something that we''ve been practicing and we''ve been doing so far. So, given this polarized landscape, we are having, we are, we are, we''re, we''re, we''re, we''re, have a lot of thoughts into where to position ourselves. You''ve, you''ve heard the previous speakers. And Hong Kong is in the, it''s already a financial hub. You have in the audience, a lot of talent in this industry. And we have a lot of them coming from all over the world and particularly from China, Chinese, which are very skilled in this area. So we have to think, how are we going to make a, provide a regulatory framework, which is pro-growth, which is allow responsible innovation, which will actually be the high level of the, be the hub and tapping into the global liquidity. So, this afternoon, we''re going to release a virtual asset roadmap in which we will lay out a forward-looking strategy by examining what way, where, where we were going forward. I can talk a little bit about it later on. Okay, certainly. So, a year ago, Americans looked to Hong Kong with envy because there was an actual rule book in Hong Kong. But now that''s changed. The U.S. with a new presidency is becoming more and more crypto. How will Hong Kong compete with that? We compete with everybody. We also have, I think we have already a track record in providing very consistent and clarity and certainty in our rules. So, we actually, our regulation is investor protection focused. And I think that is important because you are trying, the crypto industry, you can flourish, you can think, but in the end, you want to attract institutional money and retail money, but institutional money. So, we have a regime in which we make sure that every, every intersection with the public, whether it''s intermediaries like the brokers or the banks that are dealing in these assets, actually protect and put that first. And when the institutional people move into this field, then you instill trust in the community, instill trust among the investors and they will come in. So, I think compared to the other centers, we are actually very focused in making this a trading and liquidity and protection focused. Okay, great. So, here in Hong Kong, the SFC allows for in-kind redemptions for the Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Now, in the U.S., the U.S. SEC did not allow that. Can you walk through the SFC''s mindset in trying to allow this in-kind redemption, which was a real red flag for the U.S.? I think the Hong Kong journey has come to a point where the TrapFi convergence will happen. I think for, I''ve sort of laid the stage here earlier by saying that every intermediaries licensed with us or with the HKMA, we have enabled them to deal in this. So, that''s why we have virtual assets or Bitcoin, Ether, ETFs approved, six of them. I think the Ether is probably the world''s first, but certainly the world''s first, Asia''s first Bitcoin ETFs, six of them, which were authorized by the SFC in April of last year. That''s the product offering. And in that, you mentioned the future of in-kind redemption. Now, all the in-kind creation and redemption has to go through a licensed virtual assets trading platform, which are licensed by the SFC. And also the PDs, which are dealing in doing this, are also licensed, that has to be licensed. And so they have a proper, I mean, you actually mimic the entire traditional system. And through these licensed platforms, they actually tap into global liquidity. So the tracking errors, the prices are actually tracked. The Bitcoin prices, the Ether prices were very well. It worked very well. So I think this is because we have built all the ecosystem which is required for it to work smoothly. Great. Okay. So to wrap things up, what''s next for the SFC this year? What can we look forward to in Hong Kong? We actually, as I said earlier, we have given a lot of thoughts. We started the regime. We passed the legislation at a time when FTX, after the FTA collapse, collapse of the FTX. You probably remember that quite well. Certainly, yes. And because it was, people were saying that, wow, Julia, you''re very bold in taking this move. When every other trading hubs were pulling back and reviewing that. We were able to make that move because we have, as I always emphasize, an investor protection focused regime. Safe custody of assets. You have AML, FEDF, tribal rules compliance, and also segregation of assets. Many of the fraudulent or many of the concerns that you have for a crypto exchange would be mitigated, at least with very robust rules. So the following year, we passed that legislation and hearing with this journey. So come to this point, as I''ve said, the landscape is very uneven. So we have to, now that we''ve taken this bold step, but in a very prudent manner, we can actually move to a second stage where we can give a lot of emphasis to three main pillars. Innovation, again, security, which we already have, and growth. So in this pro-growth strategy, there are a few, a few limbs to it, which will be explained in full detail when we release the crypto assets roadmap this afternoon. We''ll complete the legislation with the help of the bureau, the custody, the OTC dealing, and stablecoin is already underway by the HKMA. And that''s the first part. And then we expand the product offering and services. By that, we are considering sticking. We are considering derivatives product for professional investors. We are also considering margin lending for a certain customers. The third area would be optimizing operational processes. Now, we know that it''s the degree of the hot wallet, cold wallet, and also adjust our custodian requirements, insurance requirements. These are the things that we will review on the compliance side and how to optimize to actually maximize the operational process. And, of course, we do a lot of engagement like this one to make sure and a lot of investor education. So more of it would actually do a bit of advertisement for Eric Yip, who has gone to the other stage to explain in the panel. But basically, we hope that you will download and look at it and give us feedback. Fantastic. Well, thanks for your time, Julia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('how_crypto_ai_will_defeat_big_tech', 'How Crypto AI Will Defeat Big Tech', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' . I like that there''s some folks stayed for the after show. It''s good. It''s good. Now we can start the comedy. So I have a session. I have a session. Fantastic. OK. I have a session on how crypto AI will defeat big tech. That''s the clickbait title. Of course, the story is much more complicated, which is what you saw in the panel before, because it''s not really about defeating anything. It''s about figuring out a way to be relevant. And I think more and more increasingly, it''s just a way for crypto to figure out how to even stay around. It''s like an existential question, more so than a how do we win question. But I want to introduce kind of a framework that we''ve been working on at Generative Ventures. Generative Ventures is an investor in the machine economy, so crypto AI deep in and these more frontier themes for our industry. And how our framework has evolved over the last year. Because last year I did this presentation kind of introducing the ideas and things have moved a little bit, I think. So first we can just frame the story that you''re probably hearing all the time about this industry. So by a show of hands, how many people have followed crypto AI or done anything in this space for a while? Okay, so like 50%. Great. How many use chat GPT? Okay, so like 80%, right? So probably have a big overlap of people who know that big tech is doing really well. The models are better than ever. They''re asymptotic with human performance. They''re better than you at everything that you do. They''re just not connected yet. And then number two, they''re starting to make money. So, you know, crypto has this issue of like, are we all making money or not? Is it a real business? In AI, people are making money. There''s multiple, multi-billion dollar revenue entities, right? Whether it''s big tech or whether it''s new companies from open AI to Anthropic to character AI to the coding platforms, Cursos running at 100 million. Like they''re doing things that people actually want. These are not just hypothetical tech plays. And of course, we in crypto will start complaining. We''ll say, these are closed source models. We need open source models. They''re taking our private data. We want to be paid for data. We want data sovereignty. Or they''re stealing intellectual property, right? So open AI breaking New York Times, then Deep Seek breaking open AI and so on and so forth. At the root of it. The value capture of big tech and the fact that they make me watch Instagram reels and, you know, now I''m addicted to bodybuilding videos. It''s a bit too much of a disclosure. You know, so the algorithm taking control over what it is that I''m thinking. Or, you know, they''ll never work with crypto. They''ll just use Stripe. So people are complaining about all these things. And theoretically, there are answers in Web3 for all of these ideas. And largely, this is what Web3 or crypto AI has been, right? Decentralized AI has largely been this. So we go from the Web2 world of compute leading to models, leading to capabilities, leading to distribution. And then from there, we go into the Web3 world, which is deep in compute, decentralized models, decentralized capabilities, inference networks, TE, decentralized distribution, right? So it looks the same because we''re just trying to do the same thing. If I break this down a little bit more for you, you know, in Web2, you have companies like Lambda or CoreWeave. These are $10 billion companies. They are real. They have real data centers. They do stuff. They''re not, you know, vaporware equity. In Web3, we''ve got ours too, right? Like these are our champions. Exibits, Akash, Render, IO, lots of stuff. Exo, earlier today, we spoke to them. Really great company. And then we''ll say, okay, well, these models from OpenAI or like Anthropic or this like data training thing at scale or all of that is like captured by centralized tech entities and this is bad. So we''re going to build our own. We''re going to build our own data collection like Vano. We''re going to build the grass network to scrape the internet. We''re going to build Fraction AI to do labels, things like that, right? So we''re just going to do the same thing but different. Capabilities. Big tech is really good at text generation, at video generation, at music generation, at image generation. And so let''s do that in Web3 as well. Like we''ll have our own prime intellect. We''ll have our own Morpheus. Now that DeepSeq is open source, we''ll put that on chain, right? Like we''ll just, same stuff but it''s ours. And then verification, you know, we''ll make it private. We''ll make it extra hard to use and expensive but it will be private. It will be so private that nobody will use it. That is the biggest privacy is zero users. No privacy breach there. Everyone''s like serious. That''s a joke. It''s also true. And then after that we''re going to have distribution, right? Like we, in the old world, it''s just Zuckerberg with Facebook or Musk shoving Grok into Twitter. And that''s their distribution. And then for us, we''re going to have AI agents. So we talked about CookieDAO and then we''ve got virtuals and a whole bunch of other sort of crypto-native distribution mechanisms. So, you know, we don''t need the old world. We''ll build our own Stripe. We''ll build our own tooling and developer orchestration, like a DeFi orchestration platforms and developer tools and all this stuff. We''ll code smart contracts instead of regular code and it will be amazing. So that''s crypto AI. That''s like what most people think it is. And so the question is, is this working? Like, is it really, really good? Like, are we doing a fantastic job? Right? So this is an index, performance index, that we put together. And it''s sort of from the start of the industry. And from like here to here, there''s the boom around March. That''s when BitTensor and Olaas got really big. That''s also when Martin Shkreli called out IONet for having fake servers. And then around December of last year, people were like, ah, we''re going to distribute all this stuff through AI agents. And we had the boom in virtuals and things associated with that, AIXBT. And of course, that has petered out as well. Right? So on the one hand, it''s nice. You''ve got charts that are showing things can go up 50x. On the other hand, remember that most of us are probably entering these trades when things are going down, because that''s when we''ve learned about them, not when things are going up. And so if we zoom out from that, and we compare it to big Western AI, and then obviously big Eastern Chinese AI, because we''ve got DeepSeq and increased relevance of that sector, we can plot the performance of these things relative to each other. Right? So it all depends how you zoom out. But largely speaking, like Western AI is just doing well. It''s a pretty straight line up. Eastern AI is up and down, largely because of geopolitical tension. And you can see here, for example, this is the DeepSeq moment. Right? Like when people discovered again that China exists and maybe we should invest in it. And decentralized AI, on the other hand, is this huge just speculative boom and bust. Right? So you''ve got those two peaks that I talked about. DeepSeq, which should have made everything so much better for us because it''s basically free intelligence that we could have never produced given to us on a silver platter, has instead led to a complete decline over the last, I mean, 80% decline over the last month, month and a half. So what''s going on? What''s going on is that we''re making the same mistake as an industry. You know, and this is where kind of I get into the personal view. Because again, I think what people are doing is hard and fantastic and really important to encourage the entrepreneurs. But we also want to point people in a direction that says, like, don''t waste your time. Do the thing that actually will persist instead of be driven only by speculative flows. So we think we''re in a place that''s the same mistake but it''s a different year. How many of you had like, Frentech, participated in Frentech or BitClout? You know? It''s hard to express my emotions about the genius of BitClout. Anyway, it''s the same idea. You start with money and then you end with nothing. That''s largely the business model of crypto social networks. It doesn''t work. You can''t remake a Web2 product better with Web3 because it''s a Web2 product. You know, like, just attaching capital markets to Twitter doesn''t make Twitter a better social network. This goes back to EOS for those of you who''ve been around for a while. When EOS stole $4 billion from the industry, they invested it largely in a Facebook clone whose main distinction was that it was red and had tokens on it. Right? TikTok ended up winning, not Voice, which was the EOS Facebook clone. And so we continue to remake Web2 stuff with Web3 without understanding that it''s the Web2 features that matter, not the Web3 features for these things. You look at GameFi. I mean, you have lots of talented companies doing really hard stuff. I think Axie is super innovative. This is just immutable and Ronin. You know, you basically have the same story, which is a lot of struggle to get through to any sort of industry progress. And so, you know, in terms of where, like, this is just bad news. What is the good news? And I think the good news, and this is in danger of pitching kind of what we think, is figuring out where is the economic activity going to come from on chain, and then figuring out what role it is that we can play, right? So, we know that crypto is good at financial systems, and then we know that AI is a source of labor. It''s a source of productivity. So, yes, there''s all the tech that it does. But at the end of the day, what does AI do? I''m sorry, I''m a former banker. I hate it, too. That is why I still put up McKinsey slides in conferences. So, McKinsey''s one story about AI is called Six Trillion of GDP Growth, right? Like, if you step away from the science fiction bullshit about being uploaded to Mars in the metaverse, which will be fantastic when we do it, and we''ll all trade it down to zero, the main thing about AI is that it is GDP growth, which means it creates useful things. People are willing to pay for it. That''s consumer surplus. When you buy a sandwich from me, it costs me less to make the sandwich than what you pay me. I''ve created a little bit of consumer surplus. We all win, right? That''s economic activity. So, AI generates six trillion of that. At the same time, we''ve got robot money. Robot money is crypto. It''s machine money. It takes all asset classes, and it puts them in the same place. And we know these things are true. We know that there is at least three trillion of value of robot money, and we know there''s six trillion of GDP coming. And we know that inside of our nice robot money world, we''ve got 200 billion of stable coins, and we''ve got about 20 billion or so in private credit. You know, and there''s a bunch of underwriting in DeFi. I''m not going to pull it all out. There''s a ton of transaction and swaps and all these things and payments that are going on. So we know this stuff is real. There is a financial industry. We know that people are making money on chain, right? These are application revenues. You can decide whether or not you want to count Solana. That''s up to you. We all have different religions, and that''s okay. But there is real financial revenue generation, right? So in the old world, this would be payment processing. It would be core banking services. It would be portfolio management. All of that exists. And so let''s land where we are. I mean, I don''t have an actual answer. This is just my best guess. The first thing, what everyone''s been doing, is trying to rebuild AI primitives that already work well. I don''t see a ton of evidence that this is like super duper good. I mean, it''s a great experiment, and we should definitely try it. But largely what we''ve seen as a result today, and I hate it that that''s the result, is speculation without product market fit. And you can say speculation is good. It''s going to be the capital source for building new businesses in the future, and we can all have feelings about it. But at the end of the day, that''s where we are. Number two is using AI as a distribution platform for crypto products. I just want to talk to my wallet. I want to ask my Amazon Alexa to go trade the trending meme coins and so on. And that''s interesting and good. I think that''s going to be a big platform shift. But largely what that is doing is it is replacing the distribution mechanism of mobile, or web, with voice. How many people have a Coinbase account or a Binance account? Okay, now you have a Binance robot account. You talk to the robot instead of going to the web or to the mobile app. You have not done anything to big tech. You''ve just paid them for their conversational interface. That''s it. So the only thing that I see and the thing that I''m excited about is this last bit. And this last bit is crypto''s robot money. It is the financial system that is modern, that is machine scale. And how do we figure out where we can attach that to the economic activity that the robots create? Thank you very much.', '.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('how_established_brands_are_using_web3', 'How Established Brands Are Using Web3', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hello everyone and welcome to the emerging tech stage. I''m Jen Sinassi from CoinDesk. We are going to be talking. I have a little fan club here. This is the best stage I could have been on. We''re going to be talking about how established brands are using Web3 with my fantastic panelists. So I''m going to let each one of you talk about how you are using Web3 and then we are going to dive right into it. And Popeye, we''re going to start with you because your name is Popeye and you are holding a bottle of beer. So before you tell us how Suntory is using Web3, please tell the audience very quickly why they call you Popeye. Oh yeah. First of all, Popeye is not a real name. It''s a nickname. So I got this nickname from the founder and CEO of Rakuten. And he told me that, hey, you''re not like Japanese. And out of nowhere, he said Popeye. So that''s the nickname I got. So when it comes to Web3, I would say the blockchain. And when Suntory has like Hibiki, Yamazaki, we got the French wine and stuff. But unfortunately, there''s a lot of counterfeit product. So fake product. How can we fight against those counterfeit product is something Suntory has been working on. So using a blockchain, you can''t tamper the data. So that''s something we''ve been doing. And then we just launched this very expensive beer. It''s $45 US per bottle. But then so far, we launched this one in November. And so far, so good. So that''s something I can talk about and share with you guys. Thank you. All right. We''re going to move on to Ashok now, who represents MasterCard. I think our audience is going to understand this one a little bit easier. But talk to us about how you''re incorporating Web3 into MasterCard''s business. Okay. Hi, guys. My name is Ashok. I lead the MasterCard''s digital assets and blockchain practice for Asia. We''ve been doing this for the last six or seven years, very much around the payment space. So our goal as a network is to really connect Web2 and Web3 together and make payments easier and scalable. So that way, it doesn''t matter what you have in your wallet. You could have a tokenized version of Popeye''s beer. You could have cash. You could have fiat. Whatever you have in your wallet, we want to enable that as a payment methodology to connect between Web2 and Web3. So the transition has been slow, but we are seeing a lot of progress, a lot of movement in the space as more companies like Suntory and some of the others are getting on the Web3 space and they need a digital currency payment methodology. So as the ecosystem grows, our network will continue to support. All right. So we''re going from beer to payments to fashion now. Sandy represents The Hundreds. Talk to us about how you''re incorporating Web3 into your brand. Yeah. So The Hundreds is a storytelling brand and we used Web3 to further enhance that story as well. The brand itself has been around for 20 years and throughout the years we have accumulated so many different iterations of our mascot Atom Bomb as well as different prints and patterns that we use throughout our seasonal garments. And we never really found a way to tell the story in a comprehensive way up until we had Web3 introduced to us. In a way, our project Atom Bomb Squad also doubles as an archival project. You know, we combined these characters with these backgrounds and each one has its own unique combination. It has its own unique lore and it explains why the character is the way that it is, when it was released, the pattern when it was released. So all of it dates back to 2003, whenever the brand first started and it really helps us continue the storytelling into Web3. So many of the conversations that we have at crypto conferences are, you know, with startups, people who are building Web3 first. They''re really in an exploratory phase. They''re really at the very kind of beginning, the infancy of their companies. And the reason I''m so excited to talk to the three of you today is because you''ve already had very established brands in each of your industries and you''re implementing this new technology and you have to ensure that it fits with your business model, right? You have to ensure that it works and it works for your business, but it also works for your customers. So Popeye, I''m going to pass it back over to you. Sure. When you were looking at how to solve this problem that you had, which was counterfeit products, how did you explore Web3 and how did you ensure that it was going to fit into the business model that you''d already established? Yeah. I think when it comes to average people, they don''t know much about blockchain. So at the same time, blockchain is the one you can, you know, keep the data transparent. You can tamper proof. So my role as a chief digital innovation officer, making sure that using the latest technology and anybody can use. And what we did is like a, it''s like a combination of the hardware and software. Software side, we are using Avalanche blockchain. And then when it comes to hardware, we basically use the NFC chip over the top of this 45 US dollar expensive beer. And then as soon as, you know, you open the bottle, basically you tear this NFC chip. So we can prove that this bottle is open. So in the past, because there''s no protection, anybody can open up a whiskey or wine and put the different, you know, liquid whiskey and then sell it to other people. And for us to protect the brand equity, you know, we want to make sure that the end user, those people who love Japanese whiskey, we got to provide some kind of proof. So after the end user scan, and it''s pretty simple stuff. You don''t have to download an app or anything. You just scan it. And then you just type in the certain information because it''s alcohol, so your age and the stuff. And then you get the proof of consumption. So from a brand point of view, we want to make sure that those who are not just collecting a bottle, but also they taste it. And say, for instance, this beer, I got, you know, I got the proof. And then maybe 10 years later, we, you know, some people or myself saying that, hey, I tasted this one and then I have this proof. So a lot of people I met in the past that, oh, Popeye, I love your product. Yamazaki 21 is beautiful. They can keep talking about it, but then they can collect, you know, collect those kind of NFT as a proof. So it can be more like a Pokemon card in the future. Hey, I have this and that, the other. So that''s, yeah. How many people actually do it? When you look at how many bottles you sell and how many have the availability for folks to scan that QR code? Yeah. How many people do it? Well, actually, this one is a proof of concept. So which is something we launched and limited edition, 12,000 bottles we launched. So we start collecting some data. So funny thing is, for instance, this one is only sold in Japan. But then some tourists, I guess, they bought the bottle and bring back to their home country. So I get the data that some people opened up in Taiwan, Thailand, UK, any other country, so many countries. So this is something we didn''t know. Even though this is a, you know, Japan-only product, nowadays people travel all over the world. And it''s really good to hear that, you know, from the brand side that a lot of people wanted to try this unique product. So to answer your question, it''s still a proof of concept stage. And then this year, we have some plan to go a little bit more, you know, interesting. Yeah. Ashok, I want to come to you now. MasterCard, traditional payments firm. I think it''s a perception that traditional payments firms, financial firms, are kind of slow to move and adopt new things, right? There are a lot of processes to go through. Talk to me about when you were exploring how to incorporate Web3 or crypto into your business model, how you ensured that that was going to still fit with your core business model, and you were going to get buy-in from everyone that needed to buy in. So, I mean, if you think about payments, right? Payments is what most of us just expect to happen, right? You tap your card, you go to a store, you tap it, you just expect payments to happen. So we really didn''t have to bring crypto into our rails at all. But we saw a lot of requests from our customers saying we are doing things like Suntory is doing, where they''re doing provenance of really checking the quality of goods. So as a result, we said, well, if we can wrap a certain level of conditionality around our payments to say, well, if the quality is who they claim to be, then we can actually make the payments generate, right? So it gave our customers more control when the payments were made. So we actually look at the payment itself wasn''t broken, so we never had to fix anything. But this gives you an additional layer of transparency, additional layer of security, and the ability to actually make a payment when it''s due rather than either prepaying or postpaying. So there are capabilities that you can do with blockchain that we couldn''t do fully on the traditional rails. But we''re still continuing to evolve and change and learn more. And as we do so, we can add more functionality to our services. If nothing was broken and nothing needed to be fixed, how long did it take MasterCard to decide we are going to try this thing that''s not actually solving any problem that we have? It''s still in process, right? Okay. Because, you know, I''ve been with the firm for six years, so we started doing this around six years ago. And we''re still trying to get the senior management and a lot of people, even our customers, to really understand the potential of a blockchain payment methodology. Because if you really think about it, the value that we provide is so subtle, so much in the background that most people won''t realize it. So for a general public, if they want to use their payment methodology on blockchain, it doesn''t really matter, right? But for somebody who is a business owner, wants to get paid faster, more efficiently, or let''s assume for a moment, not, you know, I order a thousand bottles of this beer and it doesn''t show up, right? I should not be responsible for making that payment until it''s actually delivered. So those kind of protections kind of come into play that most people don''t realize are so important that we can actually do using digital currencies. For the folks who represent traditional financial firms in the room who need to get buy-in from their executives to experiment with the technology, what advice would you give them? Well, I mean, you''ve got to try. You''ve got to jump in, right? You just can''t wait anymore. You could wait in the past, but now there''s so much happening in the space. If you don''t jump in now, you''re never going to be able to catch up. But MasterCard has got technology which will help you catch up to where you need to be. All right. Now we''re moving over to the fashion world. Sandy, talk to us about exploring NFTs to really kind of engage your community more when it comes to your pieces and how that fit in to your business model. Yeah. So whenever we first decided to go into NFTs, it was strictly purely for we kind of saw our mascot, Atombomb, as being the perfect person for this. We just had so much assets to use it and it just kind of seemed like the perfect avenue for it. We, I guess, we were faced with a bit of maneuvering that we had to do because our existing customer that''s coming in from the hundreds is not somebody that''s typically keen to tech. And it''s not someone that''s generally open to the conversation either or doesn''t really know how to take the steps into doing that as well. So it took a lot of onboarding on our side and trying to explain why we were doing this in the first place and why we should be involving more culture and more cool stuff like that with in tech, because there is definitely a way to use new tech within not only introducing the culture, but also bringing into apparel side as well. So it''s, it definitely took a lot of experimenting and still a lot of experimenting that takes done or to this day. And it''s, it''s fascinating. You know, it''s something that we continue to play with. What year did you launch your first collection? In 2022. Okay. Okay. And so why did you launch it knowing that it would be a challenge for your audience to understand and onboard onto? I think that speaks to the hundredth ethos. We typically do a lot of things that our audience is like, why are you guys doing that again? And we, we were just so fascinated by the topic. You know, at that time, there is this really strong conversation around creator royalties that we were really fascinated by. Um, we''ve never, you know, be, being in culture, being in, in, in the space, you never really hear of an opportunity where the artist continues to be able to, um, make profit off of their artwork, especially in a resale market, which is really huge within street road within itself. And that topic itself really fascinated us. And that''s the reason why we decided to jump into this space. We thought it was something new and something unheard of. And at that time, no apparel, I wouldn''t say no, but we were one of the earlier apparel brands that really adopted and went into the space with it. And we learned a lot from it. I pretty happy with what we did in the space. Did it have anything to do with all the hype around NFTs in 2022? You know what? So there was hype within there, but it didn''t cross over to streetwear and in the streetwear world, we were the first to go into the space and we were able to introduce that topic to some of the other people within streetwear as well. So while there was some hype in there, it didn''t necessarily cross into our world up until we kind of led the forefront for that. And I''m really happy that we did so. Cause now we, you kind of see it everywhere. You know, even I would say BoardApe Yacht Club has even made its way into the space. And then it''s really prominent within it as well. And you''re beginning to see that with other companies that are in Web3 and in NFTs, which I think it''s really cool. You mentioned that you put a lot of effort and resources into onboarding and education. What did that look like? If I was going to buy one of your clothing items, what would that education look like for me? Yeah. So we did a lot of open forum because we ourselves met with a lot of people prior to meeting there and we had a ton of questions. I mean, we''re really curious people naturally and we figured our audience would have those types of questions as well. So we made sure that we held these sessions for them. We made sure we also partnered and collaborated with other leaders in the space to not only teach people about onboarding, but other things that they would need to know in order to be in the space, such as security and safety. And we did that with our partners over at Ledger, created our own digital wallets and made sure we preach all aspects of it as well. And it took a lot of Loom sessions as well. I want to talk about, I love doing these panels because we get to hear war stories. We get to hear lessons that we may not hear in any other forum. So, Papa, I''m going to come back to you. If there was like one war story or lesson that you learned while bringing Web3 to this already very established brand, what is it? What did you take away from that? Well, I think I''m not crazy about using Web3 as a more like a special industry. Or for us, we have beautiful product like whiskey, beer, wine, and most of the people just don''t care much about how technology works. So my challenge is always like, how can I make sure that the average people can taste our product with confidence? And then for me, how can I protect the brand equity is so important for the brand company. And then a lot of people spend like thousands and thousands of dollars. Some people actually, their most expensive whiskey is now $800,000 per bottle. So how can I protect that this product is so authentic? So that''s the reason why we are not doing this for the sake of Web3. And then the brand we have to, you know, sort of protect, how can we do it? And blockchain was there. So that''s how we use the blockchain for our own business. I guess I''ll ask the whole panel then. Do we talk about Web3 too much? Should we be talking about the technology? Should we be discussing this in a totally different way? Who wants to take it? Me? Okay. Well, I mean, like I think the technology itself doesn''t matter, right? I mean, for us, it''s the underlying process that we''re trying to fix. So for us, it''s about like if it''s payments. Like B2B cross-border payments has always been a pain point. Like when I was in the US, I would send money to my parents in India. To get $1,000 from New York to India would probably take me three days, right? And that''s a long time. So using technology like this allows you to make payments much more efficiently. So if you think about a small business owner, either in Southeast Asia or Latin America, where they''re living kind of paycheck to paycheck or order to order, they want to get money much faster. Right. They want to have liquidity much faster to pay for their raw materials or downstream suppliers. So we''re able to kind of enable that much faster without, well, I still like the traditional rails, though, because we work with a lot of traditional rails. But this is an alternative to kind of move the money faster, right? You''re able to on-ramp and off-ramp these monies much more efficiently in even like smaller villages where they may not have an ATM, right? I can stick it on a card, I can stick it into a wallet, and from there you can spend it. So it''s all about the ease of access to liquidity or access to money that we should be talking about rather than what the technology is. Because the underlying tech doesn''t really matter. Right. It''s about what do you solve with it. Yeah. Well, I guess on that point, Sandy, I''m going to ask you, you know, Web3 is really solving a problem for each one of your businesses. And it''s not about just Web3. It''s not about just experimentation. It''s about solving a core business problem that you''ve had for a long time. Yeah. Why do you think more brands aren''t looking at Web3 as a solution to similar problems that we''re discussing on stage today? I think it''s a really difficult thing to do. And I believe you guys might have touched on it as well, that for someone that''s established, it takes a lot to bring people on board and to get people to that point to even want to convert to begin with. And I really do think that that''s where that hurdle kind of lies in, especially for us that have been established brands. We''re not necessarily coming from a tech background. You know, I''m coming from apparel, like I''m making T-shirts and hoodies sometimes, you know, what business do I have going into tech? But it''s really a lot that you have to learn in order to get into that forefront. But I do think it is really important work. You know, like you mentioned, it''s not about the time that we have of it being in our benefit anymore. You know, it''s happening now and it''s something that''s going to continue to come into the world. So I do think it''s worth getting into. I think that''s a good point. It''s not about going into tech. It''s about leveraging the tech for your business. Right. And that can happen across any industry. Popeye, I''d love to hear your thoughts there. Why do you think more brands, more alcohol brands aren''t doing the same thing to combat the same problem? Well, good question. I think when it comes to luxury goods, say bag or watch, I mean, that''s not something you consume. It''s okay to have a fake product. But then the product we provide, this is something people taste. So it relates to the consumption, your health, your body. So that''s why our industry of food and beverage doesn''t have to be alcohol. The drinks has to be safe. How can we guarantee that one? And how can I trust this brand? That''s something we need to solve. So, you know, fake product, people enjoy it. And, you know, later on, they tasted something different. We lose the brand, the brand trust, trust from the end user. So particularly in this industry, we got to be really careful. It''s not just the luxury goods. This is something human beings consume. So that''s something I keep telling my teammates to be mindful. Yeah. I want to keep talking about trust, authenticity, and due diligence. Because when you have an established brand, you have a loyal customer, you don''t want to lose that customer''s trust, right? And that''s something who I think anyone who''s looking to partner with a Web3 company needs to consider. Ashok, let''s start with you. What kind of due diligence are you doing when you''re looking at what Web3 partners to work with? Let''s start there. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I mean, obviously, MasterCard is a well-known brand. So it''s really important for us to kind of maintain that brand loyalty and the brand presence. So, you know, we are really careful about the type of companies we work with. We want to make sure that they maintain the same standards about customer protection and safety that we do, right? Because we are like a financial services company. We''re serving so many customers, and they trust us to actually make things happen. So, as a result, we only want to work with companies which have the same kind of level of governance internally. And also, they want to kind of maintain that quality, right? Now, just to carry on with what Popeye was saying, you know, we did a project a couple of years ago. We exported, not us, but the company exported avocados from Australia, right? And similar concept, NFT label. The person who was actually consuming the avocados knew exactly where they came from. So I think the key element now is that there''s so much more data available, and people really want to know where their food comes from or where their clothing comes from. Because they feel a sense of attachment to what they''re wearing or what they''re consuming. And we''re able to kind of provide that data. I know I kind of went off on a tangent, but I wanted to get the point in is that including trust is also about what kind of data we can actually get to kind of make us feel good about what we''re doing. And similarly, help the areas that we''re interested in. So if we''re interested in a certain thing, we can actually support it much easier now than we could in the past. Sandy, how are you ensuring that the ecosystems you decide to operate in when it comes to Web3 are the right ones for your customer? What kind of due diligence checks and balances did you do? So from my background, a lot of the customers that we have in there, like I mentioned before, aren''t necessarily keen to tech and have not done too much, I guess, acknowledgement to be familiarized with the product. So whenever we''re going into Web3, whenever we''re going into blockchain, we have to make sure that it''s one very easy to operate, that it''s easy to digest and that it''s easy to use. And that''s the work that''s really important for us. For example, the project that we worked with at Atom Bomb Squad, we partnered with OpenSea to do that. And they were really great partners for us. They made sure to almost handheld with all of our customers to bring them from point A to point B. And that''s important work, you know, being able to understand something like blockchain that''s very heavy on terminology. And it can be a little bit frightening for people to even want to get to the point where they''re interested in learning. So that part is one that we focused on for our audience. I guess I''ll ask the whole panel, how do you ensure that the partner you''re choosing has a good reputation? Like, how do you take that extra step? Well, that''s a good question. I think I''ve been in the tech industry, internet industry back in since 1997. So I use my networks, definitely. And then I think I need to meet some of the key executives, the founders and C-level suites. And based on that interaction, I make a decision. So I still have to trust my gut feeling. And is this the person I can trust on? And of course, I talk to some of my friends and network and get the reference. So it''s a very old way to do it. But I think that''s very efficient way to do it. So no companies with anonymous C-suites. Not really. No for me. No NFT executives. Well, I mean, like, you know, I think for us, it''s not about like, it''s not a one and done, right? Like the industry is changing very, you know, very rapidly. So we''ve got to constantly evaluate. Like somebody who wasn''t a, had a bad reputation could better have improved their reputation now. Or somebody had a good reputation, they could no longer have one. So for us, it''s all about constantly evaluating, constantly look at them and see that their product strategy and what they''re really trying to, what they really stand for is aligned with what we stand for. And people change, right? And we have to kind of make, make kind of conditions to say, okay, if you''re changing, let''s help you get to the right spot. So that way you can work with us. All right. We have exactly one minute left. Okay. And I want to do a power round. I''m taking up time. I''m so sorry. Papa, I''m going to start with you. If you had to name one brand that''s incorporating Web3 really well, which brand would you name? Oh, wow. That''s a tough one. I would still say the luxury brand like Airbnb H, they''re very aggressive and explore the new things. So, and I''m learning from them as well. So that''s a company I name. Yeah. Ashok? It''s a tough one, right? I mean, obviously we are. So, I mean, I think. I didn''t set the rule not to think about happening. No, but I think there''s so many, right? I see from the banking side, a lot of the traditional banks that you wouldn''t even think about are getting into the space and offering interesting services to their customers. I can''t name one or the other, but I feel that as an industry as a whole, that the banking insurance areas are probably the least to change. And they''re jumping in and doing things in the space that they wouldn''t normally do. I am really actually surprised by the institutions and banking sector. Yeah. Yeah. We''ve talked to so many. I mean, I think Franklin Templeton is doing some really, I call them the DGens of the institution. But I can''t name names. I know. I''ll name one for you. Okay. Sandy, what brand are you watching that you think is really incorporating Web3? You know, that''s a really tough question to answer. I am going to say probably Walmart because Walmart doesn''t necessarily have a Web3 factor within their own business, but they''re doing a good job of bringing Web3 companies into their spaces and into their real life stores, which I think it''s really important because it expands a whole new audience that might not have been as receptive to Web3 or open to Web3, but they have the physical product there and it opens new doors. I think it''s really honorable work and important work. Sandy, I''m surprised you wouldn''t pick us or Suntory. I know. You really had an opportunity to promote each other. You guys were always my number one. And you didn''t take it. Okay. I changed my answer. Sandy, Ashok, Popeye, thank you so much for joining me on the stage and thank you all for listening. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('how_sovereign_wealth_funds_are_accessing_digital_assets', 'How Sovereign Wealth Funds are Accessing Digital Assets', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hi everybody, how you doing? Good? All right, yes, excellent. Signs of life. Thank you. Okay, so we''re going to talk about everybody''s favorite topic, how to pester sovereign wealth funds for money. And I strongly encourage right after this session, just swarm these guys. They love it. Just go right after them. Okay, so thank you so much both for coming. My dear friends, really appreciate it. So what I love about this panel now is we have representation of how sovereign wealth funds are adapting to ensure that they stay in the center of deal flow for high-tech innovation. And we''ve got two very different ways of approaching it. So Mohamed Hamdi has done this through an external vehicle, which he''ll explain in a moment. And my dear friend Hamoud has done this internally within the Omani Investment Authority. But both are great examples of the types of structures and people that sovereign wealth funds are now engaging with and hiring to make sure that they stay in the center of strong deal flow. So let''s start with Hamdi. So really quick, let''s talk about the structure you were able to set up with ADQ and how you act as that arm for tech innovation and crypto especially. Thanks for having me. So the structure is a very simple GP LP structure. We have a sovereign that''s an LP in our fund. And this allows us to actually have full discretion as managers to be able to act on behalf of the LPs, including our sovereign, in investing and also a very specific operating model where we actually venture build from within our studio as well. The progression of us coming to a legal structure like that started off when we were executing on behalf of a sovereign entity from within the institution in building specific projects for them where they quickly realized that there was a lot of red tape. And it actually was very, very interesting for us to maintain nimbleness and be able to actually move quick in decision-making and in recruiting talent and being able to compensate talent for some of the builds that we were actually executing. So it was a very quick opportunity for us to convince our stakeholders and LP that a GP LP structure would make the most sense for us. Got it. When did you set that up? So we got licensed in September 2022. Okay. Yeah. We''ll talk in a second. I have a thesis that post-COVID, it was a bit of an awakening for lots of the sovereign wealth funds in terms of their desire to get out more and recognize the value of sourcing deal flow external to the region. But we''ll talk about that in a second. So, Hamoud. So, internally, you work in the technology department. You work in private markets. You''re VC. You have a background in deal sourcing. So, kind of talk through how your role developed and how you work in that way at the OIA. Sure. So, there was a first VC-focused fund that was established in Oman. This was an international-focused fund called IBM Investments. This came to play by a partnership between Oman Investment Authority and Oman Oil at that time. They were the main energy and oil stakeholders, essentially, and OmanTel. So, it was about $130 billion, up paid capital, and we were instructed to deploy this capital internationally into technologically innovative companies and, essentially, growth-stage companies that can have some form of value. The technology or service can have some form of value to the Middle East and can cater to our service and challenges, to the challenges that we have in the Middle East, and this can be quite wide. It can be food security, cyber security, water, monitoring surveillance, etc. So, yeah, we''ve been running this VC arm since 2017, and we''ve also been focusing on doing direct investments for OIA. That would be higher-ticket investments with quite a strong strategic local angle as well. So, we''ve done deals like XAI, SpaceX, and Crusoe, which is a digital flare mitigation technology that uses flare gas for crypto mining and intensive computing. So, how do you ensure that you don''t have an adverse selection? Look, obviously, the OIA is a very, very respected investor, and everyone I know who''s looking to raise capital, it''s on their short list of firms like to target. But, obviously, it''s challenging as a startup to fly from Silicon Valley all the way out to Oman to have that and build and engage, because this isn''t just one meeting, right? You have to invest time and energy. So, they''re stranded to some degree in these centers of excellence, whether it''s Tokyo, London, New York, Silicon Valley. How do you ensure that you''re accessing strong deal flow? Because cyber wealth funds are not generally known for externalizing their offerings, right? It''s unusual to see you speak at conferences like this. This is a relatively recent post-COVID thing. So, how do you ensure that you don''t have an adverse selection problem in deal sourcing? Yeah, I mean, I think, like, funds like OIA, I mean, we''ve been committed to top quartile funds worldwide, VCPE, so we try to, we''re in quite a good relationship with them and try to get co-investment rights and whatnot. So, we try to get, you know, the best that we can out of these relationships. So, they tend to send us the best deals that they have and, you know, not the, you know, not the bad, not the bad deals. Of course, we did also invest quite a lot of time into, into visits and trying to kind of get some market insight into specific sectors, try to see what companies are doing, what the most innovative companies are doing in each sector. So, in our team, we have specific sector champions, essentially, that talk to the experts until they become the experts and they would essentially know the top companies in the space, know the smart money that''s chasing good companies in the space and whatnot. Yep. But, yeah, I think we leverage a lot of the, this, these top quartile GP relationships. So, we''ve gotten quite good, many good deals from them as well. So, Hamdi, you were one of the first specialty vehicles, sovereign-backed specialty vehicles focused, I mean, not exclusively, but predominantly on crypto. Yeah. And that made a big splash. So, talk me through, like, you know, and we heard recently, last week it became public, Mombadla has over $400 million of Bitcoin ETF exposure. So, where are we in the cycle of sovereign wealth funds embracing this particular innovation? Yeah. So, I just wanted to just touch on a specific point on governments and what they are potentially doing today. I think what''s very important for an ecosystem is to actually not just fund grassroots initiatives like accelerators and startups directly. I think managers with different perspectives are also important to have capital to be able to deploy. I think that''s very, very important. The ecosystem just doesn''t need talent and startups. The ecosystem also needs different operators and investors to have different perspectives on what they should invest in. That''s extremely important. And I mention that because there has been an understanding that emerging managers are very, very important and it is up to sometimes sovereign wealth funds to actually anchor these emerging managers and help support them in their first fund. So, that''s a very important thesis that helped us actually raise capital. To your question around why our sovereign has invested and where our sovereign is going with the whole theme around digital assets and crypto, we had a very specific thesis where we felt that there''s a convergence between financial services and digital assets. We felt that this was a thesis that we can actually narrate to our LPs that this is the future of finance and this is definitely a domain that they needed exposure in. So, it was them actually taking a bet on us, taking a bet on the fact that we are fund managers first and foremost. So, there''s governance, there''s compliance. We are investors before we are digital asset supporters or champions or crypto supporters and champions. This is also another opportunity for people to actually show professionalism in being a fund manager in this domain, which sometimes can lack, especially previously more so than today. I couldn''t agree more. I''ll put a final point on what you said. One of the reasons I think we need sovereign wealth funds and large asset owners is their duration and their temperance for volatility is decidedly different from allocators that have to mark to market on a quarterly or annual basis. And that''s extremely important where you''re investing in inherently volatile asset classes or early stage asset classes, right? We''ve got to have folks who are patient, large capital to incubate these businesses. So, Hamoud, I know that OIA doesn''t currently invest directly in crypto, although you mentioned indirectly through Flaregas, Bitcoin mining. So, more general questions. So, you''re on the VC side. You''re on the emerging technology side. If you start to see interest in an innovative tech, so whether it''s artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, whatever it is, what is the process? How do you start to shift that huge battleship of OIA around to get interested in that technology? What can we do as market participants, as innovators, as operators, as experts to provide the information or the market infrastructure so that an OIA could eventually make a decision to allocate even a minority position to a new technology? Yeah, I think we... Well, the first step of the process for us, it''s, yes, we do look for financial return, but also local strategic impact. So, I mean, you essentially need to outline quite a challenge that''s quite prevalent in the country where it gets to, for example, water desalination or whatever it is. Like, we have to desaline seawater. It''s a very expensive process. So, it''s quite, you know, it''s a very precious commodity. So, you try to... I mean, the way that we would go with this, have a top... I mean, the way that I would do it is have a top-down approach. So, try to see what kind of challenges are most prevalent in the country. For example, it gets to, let''s say, we need some form of ICS cybersecurity solution and for oil and gas stakeholders and for critical infrastructure. I would try to see the best companies in this space, essentially, and try to talk to the main investors in this space and try to see what everybody''s doing, try to essentially get, you know, get to the conclusion what the best company in this space is. Yeah, I mean, of course, they''re, like, a tough challenge, to the sector, you need to kind of showcase that this company has, you know, in the Middle East, generally, we tend to be a bit risk-averse. So, these companies have to have some form of de-riskification. So, revenue generation, customer attraction and whatnot, technology milestones, for example, if you''re in a biotech or healthcare. So, yeah, I think founders maybe can try to better outline how they can solve certain challenges that we have in the Middle East so that we''re not just financial investors but strategic partners for them and we can work on a common commercialization framework for them to enter Oman in the GCC market. Does it, does it, so, okay, so, just to paraphrase, so, understand what goals the OIA has for the region, try to tie the technical innovation into the solving of those problems, those issues. Does it necessarily require opening up an office in Oman, for example, or having boots on the ground? Or is that necessary for investment? No, I mean, we don''t have, like, we don''t have any other offices other than Oman. We do have some JVs with other countries like Vietnam, Uzbekistan, India, etc. And we have a lot of good GP relationships. So, for now, I don''t think there is any need for us to have any boots on the ground physically. I meant for companies looking to get investment from you. Oh, I see. Do they have to set up offices in Oman? Gotcha. No, of course, that''s not necessarily the case. I mean, the more, of course, the more hardcore the strategic impact, the better it would be. The better, like, if it''s a bigger challenge to solve when it gets to, for example, protecting, you know, sensitive infrastructure, that would be great. If it can contribute to the GDP, that would be great. Developing local talent, that would be great as well. Of course, it''s, you know, it''s a bit subjective. We don''t really have a very, you know, very, you know, quantitative way of kind of measuring the impact, but we try to kind of analyze how this company or this technology would impact Oman on several fronts when it gets to the technology, the GDP, and just the general ecosystem. Hamdi, how do you source deals? Yeah, so, the way we source is we have different inbound dynamics. We have a partnership within the fund, and a lot of our partners are actually in the game of hunting. So, to avoid adverse selection, a lot of the times we actually form a very strong opinion and a thesis that we review every quarter and we actually go and hunt out for specific ideas led by founders that are executing and we found this to be the best way to avoid adverse selection but also invest and stick to our thesis across the fund. We also have a lot of collateral, content collateral and copy that we use online that helps as well. So, sometimes we get inbound from a funnel but the reality is a lot of the times the fund is very much focused on empowering the partnership, the people, the partners to be able to go out and actually hunt for very specific ideas and ultimately our game is to convince founders that we are the right type of capital to support their idea. And you and I spoke separately, same question for you but you and I spoke separately earlier about one of the mistakes that managers and startups make is if they''re not in that short term agenda and they meet with you, they give up, they disappear, they go away and not investing in that relationship over time because that agenda might change in 18 months or two years and then if they''re starting from scratch at that point, they''re behind the eight ball and maybe they won''t hit that window. So, being committed to that, it doesn''t necessarily mean they have to fly to the UAE 10 times a year but being committed to offering you information during periods where you have said to them that you''re not on my agenda right now, we''re not making a short term investment is very important. Yeah, so, you know, unfortunately, well, the dynamic of investing in crypto and digital assets has broadened this dynamic of time as a factor in actually making an investment specifically in the underlying asset of tokens. So, time has been a huge factor here and I get that. I think we are mostly focused on being equity investors so we''re not too sensitive around time as much as entrepreneurs raising on the back of a token. So, I understand the urgency of time but the reality is sometimes investors take time to build conviction to get to know the entrepreneur to see the opportunity and that is not a, time is not something that we can afford when it comes to a token based investment. So, I empathize with entrepreneurs that are very strict with time but the reality is our dynamic being purely an equity investor for the most part it takes sometimes conviction to be built within our partnership. Yeah, I mean, don''t ever raise, don''t ever try to raise money desperate. That''s just, that''s the worst, that''s the worst thing in the world. Okay, Hamoud, same question. How do you like to source and how can entrepreneurs and startups who want to get on your radar, what''s the right way for them to get your attention? Yeah, I think committing time and developing the relationship, being hands-on and delivering on promises, not over-promising at the beginning when it gets to implementation, you know, when it gets to corporate and wide execution and also execution of the strategic GCC angle that we have agreed on. So yeah, just, I guess, being sincere and committing to the relationship, not disappearing right under the fundraise, because that would eventually, essentially, impact them also in the long run. like in OIA, we have had some circumstances where we''ve committed to the company at the beginning and we''ve committed to do so over the years just because we were very impressed with the execution of the team and the interaction and the implementation, you know, the execution was just as agreed. so they essentially definitely have benefit because we were just definitely, like, what time we were re-plowing capital but with companies that, with founders that just disappear essentially and don''t commit to a certain strategic local angle that they said they would commit to, then, you know, it''s, I mean, we likely won''t reinvest with that, with those, with those kind of founders because for us, yes, we do like financial return but at the same time we do look for developing strong partnerships and for delivering impact in the Middle East. Yeah, and we were discussing offline as well this idea that if you''re speaking to one sovereign wealth fund understand there''s an informal network, referral network with internal so you''re speaking to all of them and just make sure that you, again, even if the investment doesn''t work out, you''re big boys, you said to me, like, you''re a venture portfolio expert, like, you understand they''re going to be losers in every portfolio but there''s a right way and a wrong way to lose value and if you do it the wrong way, rest assured that entire network of sovereigns will probably hear of that, right? Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I think it''s a small world and, you know, you know, word of mouth definitely plays a part so, at the Middle East, like, we interact with each other quite, quite, quite frequently and, yeah, we do, and of course, quite frequently with our partners in Europe and the US so, I mean, I mean, essentially, yeah, I mean, we''d essentially have some more insight than founders or some people in the US or Europe would think that we have. file. Hamdi, do you see sovereign interest in crypto growing? In crypto? In growing. Do you see this being sort of a dipping a toe in the water for a decade or do you see acceleration over the next, you know, 12 to 18 months? So, I think the way sovereigns probably look at digital assets in the domain of digital assets including crypto is that what has worked at least in our region is that we''ve always tried to create marketplaces that dominate specific industries and you''ve seen that for example with Dubai. Dubai created a massive logistics hub and, you know, they built the jurisdictions that reflected to support that industry, they built the infrastructure for that. So, I think what sovereigns would potentially be thinking about is how do they become the next digital asset hub that attracts talent, that brings favorable regulatory requirements and standards and by doing that they end up carving an edge as a country and an economic power. So, they''re seeing digital assets as a new domain that they can actually build within their countries and we''ve seen that with the UAE for example, we had an arbitrage opportunity in 2022 as a fund to avoid adverse selection. We wanted to take advantage of our regulatory favorable jurisdiction to be able to attract some of the talent, invest in them and have them actually operate within regulatory frameworks that were actually set already within the UAE. So, I would assume that a lot of sovereign wealth funds look into investing in new marketplaces and new domains and industries to help them carve an edge within their region. Right. I mean, the way you and I met indirectly was your government invited me out to speak to the Treasury Department about the impact of cryptocurrency on nation-state balance sheets. That was how I met your, that''s how we got introduced. So, I know that currently the OIA doesn''t invest directly in crypto but I do think it''s possible, what I''m hearing more and more of folks looking to see blockchain solutions for improving capital market efficiencies. So, you know, we''ve had a stock market that for whatever reason liquidity is not as robust as we want it to be. Maybe we can leapfrog technology the way we went from fiber optic lines to satellite and we leapfrog and use tokenization to improve liquidity and it''s more sort of financial market infrastructure play as opposed to a direct cryptocurrency investment. I know that this isn''t your focus but is that a potential angle you think in Oman? I think real world applications essentially blockchain solutions for real world applications this can be for example supply chain management warehouse management fried forwarding essentially. I''m not sure like maybe our central bank would like to do digital tokenization of our currency I''m not sure so these things definitely can come into play but I would assume the lowest hanging fruit is essentially solutions that can have real world applications and just an impact today can transform these truths today. real world use cases. Okay last comment Omdi what''s the one thing you want to leave the audience with? I think you know we''re still extremely early in our space there''s a lot of room to be able to deploy capital in this space there''s a lot of opportunity for operators to deploy capital in this space I obviously have a biased opinion here being an investor on this stage I''d like to see a lot more operators deploy capital and invest in this space in order to execute on the real use cases Hamoud last comment just about like how founders can what''s a mistake they make trying to get to you what do they do right? Yeah I think try to invest more time to the relationship be a bit more sincere and just essentially commit to the relationship essentially commit to the partnership thank you so much thanks gentlemen thank you everyone thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much Thank you.', 'Hi everybody, how you doing.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('inspiration_from_deepseek_success_for_web3ai', 'Inspiration from DeepSeek Success for Web3AI', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' First of all, let us welcome our panelists. And why don''t you guys introduce yourself and what are you guys busy with and your initial view on the topic that you want to lay the ground for today''s conversation. Jodi? Jodi. Yeah, of course. Hi, everyone. Good morning and welcome. I''m head of marketing at Hyperbolic, which is a decentralized AI cloud powering infrastructure for leading household names like Hugging Face, NYU, Cornell, Stanford. And we also power a majority of the crypto AI projects today. Our core offerings today include a GPU marketplace. We also provide inference. So that''s AI models. We have about, I think almost 40 models available on our platform today, including DeepSeq. We support the open source AI ecosystem. And so for us, DeepSeq was, you know, music to our ears to hear that we are getting to a place where it''s open source AI is getting super close to closed source models. So yeah. And a little bit about me before joining Hyperbolic. I actually worked at Avalanche where I led product marketing. And I also worked at a crypto wallet before that. Jordan, you''re in a nice construction outfit. Tell us what you''re building. Representing the data builders of public AI. At public AI, we are making it equitable for everybody to contribute their expertise and experience to AI models. We have a full pipeline from sourcing data to verifying it, to applying it to models. And we have all of that backed up with Web3 primitives. So people are doing staking and using reputation systems on chain to be able to verify the quality of the data. Because when you have 500,000 data workers showing up, self-selecting into work, you''re going to have variable quality. So we need those Web3 primitives in control of that quality. So I''m myself at public AI, I''m the CMO. So I''m leading the marketing community and supply side efforts. And prior to this, I have been in Web3 for about five years. I was at Near Foundation where I had the honor of working alongside Ilya Polisukin, famous for the Transformers, attention is all you need paper. He and I were working on DAO software that was used to lock up over 2 billion in assets for critical infrastructure projects. And prior to that, I was a technical program manager at Google. And prior to that, I spent over 10 years in advertising, running a digital innovation lab, servicing Fortune 500 companies. Oh, DeepSeek. DeepSeek is very exciting to us. As AI becomes more and more accessible to businesses, there''s going to be more and more people figuring out how to bring AI to their businesses and needing to have niche data to be able to do that. What we''re seeing is that the data that exists isn''t enough to get things up to production quality for these businesses. So going deeper than the publicly available models is the only way to do it. And the diversity that we have with all those data workers is how we can get that. It''s the only way really that we see. So we think that it''s very exciting. Cheaper technology means it''s in more people''s hands. It''s great for the industry. And it''s a killer use case for Web3 to be so well positioned as AI is rising. Thank you. Thank you. Ming. Hello, everyone. I''m Ming Wu. And I''m the co-founder and the CTO of ZeroG. And ZeroG is a project that''s a target to provide a scalable decentralized AI infrastructure for the Web3 AI workload. And we''re targeting to provide what we call a decentralized AI operating system, which targets to manage the decentralized storage and the computation resources for the applications so that we can easily onboard the AI applications from Web2 to Web3 in a decentralized way. And, of course, we provide very scalable technologies to scale the requirement of the AI workload. And for me, before joining the Web3, I was working in the Microsoft Research Asia for 11 years, mainly research on the distributed system, including all the storage, computation, transaction, and also the AI platform. And later on, I co-founded another blockchain complex with FanLong, which introduced innovative consensus protocol to provide both the high performance and also the high extent of decentralization. And recently, I transferred to the zero G project and because I recently met with our CEO, Michael, and we discussed some new ideas about how to combine AI technology into the blockchain area so that we can have more larger scope of this technology stuff. Yeah. Okay. Maybe this time I ask questions. The other reverse order. So, Ming, as a computer scientist, and, you know, your background remind me a lot of David Ysse, who, you know, initially created the whole Wi-Fi protocol. Now he''s doing Bitcoin layer 2, right? Like, what''s in your scientist mind? Like, how you see, you know, AI, Web3, like, interact? You see that as a natural expansion of technological advancement? Or you feel that, you know, there is, you know, you more look at that from utility perspective and all that? Because you have a very unique entrepreneurship kind of a journey. Yeah. Yeah. So, I think we see that the AI technology is becoming more and more powerful. And currently, AI intelligence can be compatible to the human brain at many, many areas. And so, we think that just because of this, we think that the centralized AI can have a big problem in the future. Because when we apply such advanced AI technologies in the area that will affect the user daily life, it''s very dangerous if we don''t know how this AI model is trained and what''s the original intention that the AI model can have. So, we do believe that we need some transparency to all the control power about this. So that we can have AI and be more aligned to the human intention value. So, can do good things for the human life. And so, we believe that the decentralized technology provided by the blockchain can be a major help on this kind of mission. Because the blockchain technology makes all the data and the computation more transparent to users. And many of them can be verified in a very way. So, and also with high performance blockchain infrastructure, we can keep track the entire cycle of the AI pipeline from the data ingestion, data cleaning, labeling, and also the model training and inference. The whole cycle we can monitor it. And we can measure the honesty of the entire process. And another issue is that the centralized AI may generate a lot of profit and revenue profit. But the distribution of the reward may not be that fair. Because, for example, the open air actually got a lot of revenue by themselves. But they actually crowd a huge amount of data from the internet. But they don''t feedback this reward to those contributors. So, I think we share the same mission with public air maybe. And we think that with this transparency and we have the power to redistribute the revenue generated by the AI to all the contributors from the data and the computation side. So, I think that''s the purpose that we built this. We want to combine AI and the crypto. Thank you, Ming. Jordan, when we talk about AI, people focus on three elements, right? Data, computing power, algorithm. So, is it fair to say public AI focuses more on the data side? And if so, how do you see your effort, your achievement, your direction improves efficiencies relative to, say, your peers in Web 2, as we broadly categorize this, say, scale AI or the other guys? So, I guess from this particular segment, would you like to share your insight? Yeah. As you mentioned, people think about compute and data as big bottlenecks for AI. We aren''t so concerned with compute. One of the examples that my co-founder, Dr. Steven Wong, likes to make is if you have an AI and you''re training it, it''s like giving a student a book. If it''s a good book, they can look at it for a minute or read it once and it''s going to be fine. If you give them a bad book, they can look at it for years and still not learn anything. So, that thinking... Now I realize I have been reading bad books. I''ve figured out a lot of things in life. Too much doom scrolling. Yeah. And then that''s really why our thinking is around the value of data. And it''s something that the Web 2 world has seen. Like, that''s why the Web 2 giants are so easily able to profit off of the data that they''ve been pillaging from their users for so long. So, we really have that thinking around the data being the most valuable part. And the real differentiator that Web 3 is able to provide is the diversity. If you are a centralized, top-down company trying to build an AI, you''re going to be doing it for a specific use case that''s aligned with your interests. And for human diversity to show up and inform those things, you actually need a large set of individual contributors. And that diversity of data is what''s going to get you over the hump of kind of the generic slop that we have today. A lot of our clients have some successful experiments with large language models, but they can''t get it up to the production-grade reliability of 99 or 99.9% that they need to get these things actually running for their companies. And it''s also too expensive to be running large language models for everything. So, by getting the right data, the good books, we''re able to train models that are more efficient to run and do so more reliably than just running the large language models. So, that''s where we''re really providing value and why I think we have, you know, decent revenue to date and are really optimistic about the future. Excellent. Excellent. Charlie, I guess now the question is on your business now. Sounds like you guys are focusing on AI computing cloud. Is that the right description? And if so, relative to those giants that spend, you know, zillions of dollars and zillions of megawatts of power creating this and fearing this AI growth and expansion, what is Hyperbolic is doing and how you''re going to disrupt the status quo here? Yeah, of course. I think, you know, Hyperbolic has received a lot of attention because we have entered a space where there are these Web 2 giants. And we kind of looked at the problem similar how to the Deep Seek AI team probably did. We had constraints in front of us, but we thought, you know what, let''s do things differently. Let''s ditch the middlemen. And that''s why also Web 3 really aligns with our core values, which is about transparency, also equitability, ensuring everyone who contributes in our ecosystem is rewarded. But specifically for our business, the way we''ve been able to differentiate ourselves is just, like I said, ditching the middlemen. So we are a decentralized AI cloud. Our GPU marketplace is one of the many services we offer. And on top of that, we have these inference models, like I also told you about. And what we''re able to do is with these two specific services, we cut costs by 75%. We also have a platform that is fully private. So that''s really important for developers, for example, who want to access Deep Seek, but don''t want to send their data back. And so it''s a serverless platform. And because the platform itself is also really easy to use, we have gained attention from, like, OpenAI''s co-founder who left OpenAI. And he was also the previous director of Tesla AI, Andre Carpathia, one of the biggest names in the Web 2 world. So, yeah, I think just our ethos is to democratize AI access, push AI''s evolution forward, and, yeah, rethink the ballgame. Super. Yeah. We''re here at a consensus in Hong Kong to celebrate Web 3, celebrate crypto and the blockchain, right? But what I''ve experienced is that every single time we say, okay, here we have the solution and the future, then there is always disruption out there, right? Deep Seek is the disruption, right? For us here in Asia, in Hong Kong in particular, we probably don''t have access to OpenAI without VPN and all that. Now here we are, something cheaper, arguably better to a certain extent, and more accessible. So what do you think, you know, as an entrepreneur, as, you know, focusing the talents, focusing this space, you know, what do you value the most? Is it the efficiency, right? Is it the access? Is it the, you know, the censorship proof? You know, other things that you try to distinguish from the centralized business rather than the Web 3 kind of business you guys are building on? So probably, do you have to? Yeah, of course. So, yeah, Deep Seek''s a great example for us of why open source AI is so valuable. I think for us, you know, there''s a couple of things that arise as like an AI cloud, right? Of course, they were able to train the model with less GPUs available, but they were only able to do that because of the constraints that were given to them. They decided they wanted to create a completely new algorithm for reinforcement learning. And so I think for us, when we see that kind of innovation, it excites us because it also allows builders now to go and build agents, applications, whatever that may be. And we like to say, take your wildest dreams, hyperbolic, right? Like we want you to be able to build whatever you want and not have to think about the costs, the scalability, if the model works, if the platform works. Like we want to strip that away for all the developers. And that''s how we''ve been able to garner over 100,000 developers today in the Web 2 world building on hyperbolic. And we''re excited to continue to expand that in the Web 3 space. And like I said, we power a majority of the crypto AI projects today, including some of the most popular agents that you might know, like Virtuals Protocol, Zero Bro, Eliza. The list goes on. So Lang, Arc, there''s a ton. And the reason they trust us is because we have a platform that works, that''s live. And yeah, it''s just easy to use. Okay. So what I hear is open source, open access. Exactly. Super. Jordan? Yeah. For us, the access is key. When more people have access to AI, it means more clients for us. More organizations are figuring out how this technology applies to their businesses. So it''s a very healthy thing to see it so available globally. As far as the efficiency goes, DeepSeek was able to do what they did because they had access to good data. As a quantitative trading firm, they were sitting on years of data that allowed them to very quickly train up a model. And also take advantage of synthetic data along the way. At public AI, we don''t think that you need a human in the loop for every single step. There''s efficiencies to be able to do that. There''s efficiencies to be had by using synthetic data for some steps, using AI for certain decision making, etc. But there are edges where humans still matter. And that''s where we''re capturing value is around those edges where human input and human output are the most valuable things. And that''s why we''re able to actually make it equitable for people to participate in this future where AI is here. It''s not coming. It''s here. And another touch point on access is we were talking earlier, mentioning the fact that AI can be centralized or decentralized or maybe even autonomous. We see it as a gradation where the centralized AI is always going to be in private interest, so it will never be for the people. If we care about humans, we care about people, it has to at least be decentralized where through voting or their own data and interest and expression, they can show up in these models. Our human things that make us human are our languages, our interests, everything shows up in the models. And that decentralization is an essential step for if we get to autonomous, which is still kind of sci-fi. But if we want human values to show up in autonomous, it has to come from people. Otherwise, we will have private interests that are autonomous and those aren''t going to be putting people first. So we really see it as part of the essence of our mission and vision to make sure that humans are represented in these models through their data. Decentralization, autonomy, human existence. Excellent. Let''s go. Let''s go, yeah. Me? I also think that the DeepSea technology actually provides opportunities for people to deploy AI training and inference in the decentralized setup. So basically, because it requires less resources, so that can more easily leverage the decentralized computation power. And also, you know, previously, we were actually working on addressing a lot of challenges to deploy the AI training in decentralized situation. Because in the decentralized situation environment, the network bandwidth is very constrained. And if we use that environment to train a very large scale model, it''s kind of not realistic. But currently, I think with the advancement of DeepSea technology, it makes this decentralized AI pipeline more practical. So I think that''s a good thing. Another thing that I think DeepSea provides is that it actually changed the way that the competition of the model training. For example, because it actually shows the power of the reinforcement learning, drives the exploration of the reasoning process of the model. So that''s it actually, so I think this is the key technology that allows we shrink the model size to have the same level of intelligence of the model. So I think this actually, so previously, there''s no way for the startup and the small group to compete with the large-gen, like OpenAI, right? Because they need a lot of huge amount of resources. Who owns the large amount of GPUs will definitely win. But currently, I think the situation changed a little bit because people are actually thinking how to invent some new reasoning framework to exploit the most value of the model intelligence there. So that means that a small team and more talented people can have more power to contribute in this area. So I think this makes the competition more extensive and more fair in this market. Right. Sounds like the open source, open knowledge base, the open society concept coupled with Web3 participation is the way, at least, to make progress. Yes. When I got the assignment to moderate this panel, I did ask DeepSeek about what would be the inspiration from DeepSeek''s successful Web3 AI. And the smart DeepSeek that we have talked about for the past 20 minutes give the following answer. And I want you to hear this and see whether you agree, whether you would add on those. Would that be the focus for you as an entrepreneur or for business? So that includes 10 things. Bear with me, guys. So data-driven decision-making, scalability performance, user-centric design, security privacy, collaboration, ecosystem building, continuous innovation, regulatory compliance, community engagement, interoperability, ethical AI practice. I feel a lot of this is AI try to fill in 10 points. But, you know, pick any one of these things that kind of echoes with your what do you think about AI, about DeepSeek in general. And probably elaborate that and share with the audience. Yeah. Beautiful. I think at Hyperbolic what really aligned with us was the efficiency. So as I mentioned before, now there are multiple areas that ourself as a business can start to think about. So not only do we have the compute inference, we also have an agent framework that allows for developers to tap into our compute as well as our inference and begin to create agents that can scale, self-replicate, and run autonomously. And so these, I think this part of the business is really exciting because now people will have more money to focus on other areas other than just worrying about the availability of compute and also the cost of the inference model. So I think that''s probably the one that aligns most with us. Yeah. Yeah. What about, say, the security and compliance part? Yeah. You guys are in US. Oh, all of you guys are. But, you know, what''s your angle, you know, how you see that fitting, you know, the current environment, I guess, regulatory-wise? Yeah. You know, it''s funny. There is definitely a, we actually wrote an article about this the other day. There''s obviously the cultural alignment and cultural shift that has happened. And I think we celebrate the fact that this did come out of a constrained environment. And whether or not it came from the US or not doesn''t matter to us as long as it''s moving open source. No, people actually talk about it. We''re from US and all that now. Right. That''s right. So, yeah, that''s a plus, I guess. Yeah, it''s a plus for us. And I think the great thing, too, about having platforms like Hyperbolic and other decentralized platforms is that, and ones that also prioritize privacy, is that you do have options out there to build without being worried about sending your data to the wrong place. So, at Hyperbolic, if you were to tap into our APIs, they''re serverless, and they''re fully private, so you don''t have to worry about that. Got it. Thank you. Yeah, cool. Jordan? Yeah, from my perspective, I think that the UX angle is especially interesting because that was kind of the tipping point where we went from, oh, GPT is kind of a cute, interesting computer science kind of thing, to, oh, everybody can suddenly chat with it, and it makes sense, and people understand why this is so powerful. So, UX is a critical point, and to be able to iterate on UX quickly with AI in the loop means that, for us, our clients are learning what this could mean for their businesses easier, so we''re able to service them easier. They understand how it fits easier. We can use AI in that loop. And then, from the other UX point of view, there isn''t one point of alignment for AI because there isn''t one point of alignment for humans, and that is the beauty of humans is that we are diverse, and that''s why it''s amazing when we bring people together from different countries and see competition between them. It can be seen as negative, but it''s actually healthy for everything moving forward together. So, whenever I hear people trying to reach one point of alignment for AI, that''s always a concern for me, and that''s why for AI to be meaningful and for it to be accessible to everybody, we need decentralized inputs to this, and to run decentralized and for it to make money for people in a decentralized way. Otherwise, it''s meaningless to humans, so Web3 is the only way to drive AI forward in an equitable way that we can see. Thank you. Yeah, so I want to add some comments on the regulatory compliance aspect. So, I think the key to help on this kind of thing is to give the AI or agent the ID and all the ownership, and also the ownership. So, the ID actually may give this agent a responsibility, and the ownership may give the agent some access control stuff. So, by doing this, actually, this is also relevant to some stuff that we are working on in Zero-G. So, basically, we think that the way to achieve that is to combine, to bond the agent with specific NFT so that it can have the on-chain identification and also have the ownership to some wallet address of users. And, but, we realized that it cannot use the traditional standard NFT, the current standard of NFT because the agent data, which could be the model, the memory, and the character, are valuable data. And, it should not be maintained in a public way so that we need to introduce some privacy-preserving technology around it. And, so, this gives us a challenge that how we can design NFT protocol that allows the enable to transfer with this privacy data. So, that''s, to achieve that, we propose a new NFT standard that we call iNFT, intelligent NFT, and with an innovative protocol that allows the users to transfer this valuable private agent model, agent data. And, also, we are going to work on the marketplace on top of this technology so that we can have the OpenSea counterpart in the agent world. Nice. So, we are approaching the end of the panel. So, very quickly for each of every one of you. So, what would be the question you ask AI when you try a new AI agent or, you know, when you invite folks to try your apps or try your site? What would be that one question? Jodi? Sorry, could you clear that up a bit more? No, like, you know, guess what''s the weather today? You know, what would be the stock, you know, where Bitcoin is going to be next month? What would be that single one question you want to ask AI about? I don''t know if you guys have tried this, but if you ask how many R''s are in strawberry, I usually get that one wrong. Okay. Jordan? Redacted. I always read Team B censorship resistibility. Yeah. Cool. So, I often use the AI for translation. Yeah. I guess we all read, most of us read, what''s that, Hitchhack''s Guide to Galaxy? Yeah. Ultimate Question 42. So, with that, we end this panel. And, wow. For us, happy trading for you guys. Happy AI development. Amen.', 'First of all, let us welcome our panelists.

So thanks all for coming. I''ve got Raj Bambarat here and then we''ve got James Harris from Zodio Custody. And then we''ve got 0xSocratic here on the far corner there and he''s from Dab Dab. So I''ll let them just explain what they''re doing and we''re going to hear from Raj in a minute. So what is Zebu exactly? You''re a bulk telecoms payments provider. Just explain what you''re doing a little bit. So Zebu at the high level is effectively a mission to get crypto and blockchain technology to the next 1, 2, 3 billion users. And we saw an opportunity to do so specifically through the telecom industry, both at the wholesale level and the retail level. Wherein we are working to integrate vertically directly to the cell phone service subscribers all over the world to enable blockchain wallets for them, crypto collateralized credit cards, etc. And then at the wholesale level, we are currently enabling 140 institutional telecom clients to settle value. So payments cross borders instantaneously and at a very cheap rate. And we have enabled them to do over $6 billion in transactions till date. That''s amazing. And you started only in 2023, right? Yeah. So that''s $6 billion in about 18, 20 months. That''s the power of crypto. So James, Zodiac, what do you do? First of all, thank you very much for inviting me on this Zebu stage. So thanks, Raj. Lovely to be here today. James Harris, Chief Commercial Officer at Zodiac Custody. We are a regulated digital asset custodian based in UK, Europe, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, Japan. So pretty much global. And we''re also owned by a consortium of banks, including Standard Chartered, SBI and Northern Trust. So we''ve got two verticals. The first one is we look after people''s balances. And the second one is we also provide technology to banks and financial institutions so that they themselves can be digital asset custodians. And we do that predominantly with Standard Chartered, who recently announced an offering. Okay. ZeroX, Socratic, DabDab, tell us about that. Cool. Yeah. First of all, thank you for inviting us. So basically, DabDab is a consumer app that aims to address the UX fragmentation in the market today. So TLDR on the numbers, basically there''s about like 5,000 to 6,000 DeFi application recorded on DeFi Llama these days. And there''s about like hundreds of the layer 2s, layer 1s. To the end users, like they will feel fragmented when they access the different apps across different chains. Seeing like changing different websites, switching between different wallets. So DabDab is basically a consumer app that aims to address the UX fragmentation. And basically we have integrated about 200 different DeFi applications across 20 different chains. And basically users can come to a single platform, they can interact with all of the applications on a single platform. And yeah, well today we served around 12 million users to date. So that number is still growing. Great. So what three of you have in common is you''re all doing abstraction or reducing complexity for mainstream companies to get involved with crypto. So just talk about that theme within your business. How are you doing that for the telecom clients? Well, I think kind of to add on to zero access point, fragmentation of services is like a massive issue within Web3. When whether you''re a retail user or an institutional user, you need to be fragmented. You know, you need to go to multiple services into in order to achieve one single thing. Right? Usually it''s like I''ll on ramp from fiat to crypto from one venue. I''ll be custodying my assets in another one. I''ll be verifying transactions in another venue, such as, you know, a scanner, et cetera. And for most people that aren''t necessarily Web3 native, and nor are they highly incentivized to become Web3 native, this is a pretty high barrier to entry. So with Zebu, what we did specifically for institutions was we added a bunch of value added services into one specific platform. We enabled fiat on ramp off ramp, KYC, KYB, KYT, custodial, non-custodial services, et cetera, along with invoicing all in one platform. Wherein their experience as a user doesn''t really change much from what they were already used to, but they still get the end benefits of using blockchain technology. And I think that''s like a pretty core ethos of ours with, you know, as we while we horizontally expanded other industries such as commodities, music, automated payments, and we even are vertically expanding within Teleco, our main focus continues to remain is how do we give the end benefit of blockchain technology to the larger masses of institutional and retail users while, you know, abstracting them away from the complexity of fragmentation and lack of understanding. So you''re reducing the cost of making bulk payments, B2B bulk payments within telecom companies. Yes. So what was the problem they had before that you''re now solving with a stable coin mechanism? So number one, massive delays using traditional bank accounts simply in order to remit value because most wholesale service providers are remitting at a global scale, right? Whenever you''re remitting at a global scale, the fiat is going through multiple institutions usually, you know, anywhere between two to three. And in the process, those institutions have reserve requirements. And as part of the reserve requirements, they will hold your capital for one, two, three days at a time, which could lead to a delay of, you know, up to 14 days in some cases. So the wholesale service providers were losing out on massive opportunity to pre-purchase capacity at a global scale because of those delays. And additionally, specifically for emerging markets where dollar availability is low, they weren''t expensive and expensive. Yeah, exactly. They weren''t able to maximize their potential when it came to margins and, I guess, acquiring business at a global scale. So what we did was we set up pairs at a local level with ZBU and the local currency. And we started sourcing stable coin from a much cheaper avenue. ZBU is your utility token. Yes. ZBU is our utility token. It''s used for remittances, on ramp, in some cases, store value and loyalty and rewards. And that is effectively what enables cheap transactions at a global scale. Right. So James, what does abstraction mean for you? Actually, we share another thing in common. We all work with Waxman, the PR agent. They got us together on the stage today, which is super cool. Thank you, Waxman. I think abstracting away the blockchain for us is not just something we deal with on a day-to-day basis. It''s something that is a core value proposition for us. I mean, our clients are banks, brokers, institutions, fund managers, that kind of thing. And they want exposure to the digital assets without the headaches that come with them. Right. They want to explore the paradigms that are possible in digital assets, but they just don''t want to do the infrastructure work. So I think we help our clients interact with digital assets in a way that feels familiar to them. And that means, one, we need to know what their flows are and how they do things, because we need to match up things that they do. But we don''t want them to be too worried about key management or smart contract security risk and that kind of thing. We abstract that away from them. And so really then it boils down to us providing them with a regulated bank-grade custody service where the assets are held in the same way that they''re already used to, with traditional assets or whatever it is. So there''s a couple of ways that we do that. So our first vertical is that we provide balances and we hold balances and wallets for our clients. And a client shouldn''t really care whether it''s BTC or a tokenized fund. Right. It''s the same. They want to hold the assets. They want to show them on the GUI. They want to be able to know what it''s worth. They want to be able to transact if they need to. That''s it. They don''t need to know the vagaries of what it''s like to interact with the underlying blockchain. And then from a SaaS white label perspective, they just want a technology platform that looks like everything else that they''ve got. Right. So that''s, I think, a key thing that we do. And that''s why banks like Standard Chartered and the SBI group, they all trust us to do that. I always like to joke that custody is actually the most stressful, boring job in the world. And the reason why it''s stressful and boring at the same time. It doesn''t sound like a joke. Well, yeah. It doesn''t feel like a joke, but, you know, welcome to our world. But it''s because just to provide a wallet service that has all of the coins and tokens that it needs to hold, all of the services that are attached to it, you have to integrate with everybody. Right. You have to understand new protocols. Everyone''s got different APIs. You have to take that away. And as a whole, if you look at that, it''s a big exercise in abstraction. So that''s really what we do. We want to see blockchain really as an enabler, not a barrier. Right. So that''s how we look at it. And we like to bring our clients on that journey. It''s a really tough journey. And so if we can impart some of the lessons we''ve learned the hard way so that they don''t have to, they can get on what''s important to them, which is serving their customers and growing their businesses. Great. Zero X Socratic. So I love the name, by the way. Dab Dab. So it''s a DeFi platform that allows people to transact across multiple chains from a single place, right? Yep. Yeah. Basically, abstraction is the core value of what we offer. And abstraction to us is about efficiency. Before we started this application, we''ve done some data studies in the market. We see that, like, on average, there''s about a couple million active users, monthly active users in the market. But each of them will only really have, like, about five to ten minutes a day, interacting with all applications across the market. But it creates, the problem it creates is without a unified platform, without a unified access place, it creates tougher and tougher place market for new startups trying to compete for a portion of the user attention. Right? So, like, abstraction basically for us is a mission to improve the efficiencies of how users can allocate the time such that they can maximize the encounter and DeFi users'' use cases that they can interact on chain. Right? Secondly, it''s about expansion. So, think about, like, average users will only have about five to ten minutes a day. What else, what are the other times they''re allocating on? Maybe on TikTok, maybe on, like, Amazon, maybe on, like, different, like, Alipay or PayPal examples. Right? We are, we need to compete for more user attention from them. Right? So, like, custodian services, also, like, payment services, and also real-world asset services, they need to be combined together. We need to work together to improve, like, on attracting away the user steps and for them to, like, experience as a whole system. So, we, as a whole market, can grow better to compete for more attention from those markets instead of, like, competing with the internal resources. Yes. Awesome. Great. So, we don''t have too long left here. So, you''re going into retail now. You''re not sticking just with institutions. You''re now going B to C as well. Yeah. I think we''ve done pretty well capturing the telco wholesale market already, you know, again, $6 billion in transactions in the past 18 or so months. And we''re well set to increase that number quite a bit exponentially as we bring in more and more liquidity into our liquidity protocol for Zebu. So, now we''re mainly focused on, I guess, three things. Main thing is the Zebu protocol, where we have node operators that effectively act as our network''s consensus mechanisms to verify transactions, source the cheapest possible liquidity, provide abstraction services such as gas abstraction, and then stakes ZBU as economic security, and then also liquidity providers that enable us to provide low-slipish transactions across the board. So, as we bring on those participants, we''re now able to enable more and more industries such as direct retail of cell phone service providers, and also horizontally expand to other institutional providers such as shipping, commodities, automated payments, etc. Okay. So, more participants, more liquidity, more useful service. Yes. And then all of the participants that join us in the Zebu protocol are effectively able to earn a share of our revenues. So, real-world yield paid out in stablecoin. Right. Yeah. All right. Unfortunately, that''s all the time we have for today. Thanks very much. Awesome. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks everyone.

We are all gathered from truly around the world at ConsenSys Hong Kong. This is the Open Money Summit and this is the stage where you''re going to learn all things about how traditional finance and the digital ecosystem are converging and intersecting. I''m Tira Gray, Managing Director of Coindesk Events, and it''s truly a pleasure to welcome you in our very first session, which could not be more appropriate to start the day with, from Wall Street to crypto. We have three esteemed Wall Street veterans joining us today for this opening session. It is my pleasure to welcome them to the stage. The at scale is best represented by the over 8,000 attendees of which over 75% traveled from outside of Hong Kong to join us. We have nearly 100 countries represented here today. Second is to leverage Hong Kong''s unique geographic position to be a gateway to Asia. We have gathered the top voices and ecosystems from around the region to provide attendees an effective and efficient way to gain substantive insight into the Asia region. And finally, third is to showcase Hong Kong. This is my home and it is our ambition to lead the Web3 industry in how conferences can incorporate the uniqueness of our host city. It''s been our desire with ConsenSys to incorporate iconically Hong Kong elements into the official conference experience and to get you to fall in love with our city. One of the best examples of this is the partnership that we have as the first ever Web3 Cup race sponsor for the Hong Kong Jockey Club, which we will be hosting the ConsenSys Cup tonight at the Happy Valley Racecourse, an iconically Hong Kong experience you should not miss. On top of that, there are over 330 side events scattered across the city this week. I hope that you get the chance to experience everything the city of Hong Kong has to offer. We sincerely appreciate how much time, effort and resources you have invested into making ConsenSys Hong Kong one of the most important Web3 conferences globally this year. We also appreciate how much time, a lot of the people who have done this work, we are here today. Thank you. Those are some incredible stats, Michael. Good morning, everyone. Joe Son. Zao Sang-hao. Wow, I am just beyond energized by the enthusiasm and the excitement that''s in this room right now. Thank you so much to everyone who traveled from near and far here to Hong Kong to join us this week. On behalf of CoinDesk, we are thrilled to be building on the legacy of the Consensus Conference, the longest running and the most respected digital asset conference in the world by expanding and growing and bringing the experience here to Asia. This marks the first major crypto gathering this year, really setting the stage for 2025. Even though we''re just a few weeks into this year, it''s already been a landmark start to 2025 with so much happening in the space. What an exciting time to be in the digital assets industry and to all be gathered here together. We''re seeing real progress from around the world as governments like right here in Hong Kong develop clear crypto regulations. And as a result, after what feels like many years of waiting, more institutions are entering the space. And institutional adoption is really starting to gain some momentum. We''re discovering new practical use cases for blockchain technology more and more every single day. And finally, the entire space is buzzing with new entrants who are just driving this innovation and growth. So as you walk the halls of the convention center over these next few days, as you listen in on panels, as you partake in meetings, I hope you''ll have the opportunity to really explore and discuss all of these exciting developments that are happening. I hope you meet with some great people. I hope you learn a ton. And I also hope you close some deals, which is what consensus is really, really all about. So again, I want to thank you all for being here. We hope you have an incredible and productive time here at this conference. And we look forward to seeing you in just a few months at our flagship conference, consensus conference, which is happening this year in Toronto in May. So thank you so much. And without further ado, I''ll let Michael introduce our honorary keynote speaker today. Thank you. Thank you so much, Sarah. So with that, I would now like to invite the Honorable Mr. Paul Chen, Financial Secretary of the Government of the Hong Kong SAR, to join us on stage to deliver his opening keynote.', 'Music Good morning.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('what_world_is_crypto_creating__', 'What World is Crypto Creating _', '未知講者', '未分類', ' Hi everybody. We''re here to talk about the future of crypto. I know you think you''ve been hearing about that for the last two days, but I promise you, you haven''t heard it like this before. Joining me today are three of the preeminent world experts on all things happening within the markets. I''m going to let each of them introduce themselves. But what you''re going to hear today, over the next 30 minutes, is a discussion of kind of what, between the next now and five years from now, 2030 if you can believe it, how the world''s going to change vis-a-vis how crypto is going to be actually adopted. Not hopes, not dreams, practically, realistically, what''s going to occur. Personally, if I were an investor, I''d be listening to this, not for financial advice, but just to understand what the real TAM might be. So, Kevin, let''s start with you. Sure, thanks. Who are you? Yes. Yeah, I''m Kevin. I''m the co-founder and CEO of Kirok. We''re a financial service provider based originally in Europe, but active worldwide now. We work with token issuers initially as a market maker, but then we expanded our activities. We''re an OTC desk on Spot and Options, and we really, we work with our clients to build long-term partnerships and make sure that their markets are a success, basically. Excellent. Thanks so much. Michael. Sure. Michael Wu here, co-founder and CEO of Amber Group. Amber Group is a eighth year startup. We are- Is it considered a startup after eight years? Well, mentally, we always see ourselves as startup founders. Fair enough. But, I mean, in terms of scale, we are one of the largest market maker, one of the largest service provider category leader in Asia in terms of crypto financial services. But at the core, we also see ourselves as a crypto technology builder. In terms of our businesses, we deal across the full spectrum crypto from the most innovative, highly iterative crypto native projects to, you know, guys who are coming into crypto. Yeah. We also have the stratified institutions, high networks, family offices. So we do see ourselves as the gateway to crypto. And, you know, eighth year, tenth year, eighteenth year, hopefully we''ll continue to see ourselves that way. I''m sure you will. Henry. Hi, my name is Henry. I serve as the CEO of Bitsy, btsc.com. We are an exchange provider, Spot, Futures, Markets. We are also a leader in B2B, so we provide exchange services for wallets. If you want to run a centralized exchange, decentralized exchange, any sort of infrastructure on crypto, we provide that as well, both cryptocurrencies. Starting this space 2016, right here in Hong Kong. We''re based in Asia, small but growing firm, about 350 people now, looking to hire more, expand our talent pool and continue to invest into this industry. Well, I can tell you this. Back in 2016, a company with 350 people in crypto, consensus didn''t have 350 people in 2016. Yeah. So that was new. And Henry, how long, sorry, Michael, how long have you been in crypto? I mean, personally, probably around 2016, 2017, but Amber started in late 2017. Kevin. Same thing. So personally, 2014 actually, so 10 years now. And Kirok, we started in 2017. Excellent. And I''m, for those of you who don''t know, I''m David Waxman of Waxman. We''re celebrating our 10th year in business. And I''ve been in space since early 2014. So between all of us, we''ve seen a lot of cycles. And the reason I''m mentioning this is because our job today is to predict the future. And Winston Churchill and a lot of others would like to say that although history essentially doesn''t repeat itself, it often rhymes. So before we can kind of talk about the future, I kind of want to talk about now. Where are we? I believe recently it was unveiled that Binance claims, at least, to have 700 million registered users. And if there are eight, roughly eight billion people on Earth, that means, what is that, nine, eight and a half percent of all people on the planet have a Binance account? So are we past the entry point of crypto? I mean, is this really where we are? Almost 10% of people have wallets. Kevin? Yeah, sure. I mean, if they have the numbers, they have the numbers, right? So I guess that''s where we are. And what''s interesting to me is that when you look at the comparison between how much expectation and the hype there is on this technology and what it allows, which brought so many people to be active on digital assets versus the actual mainstream usage that remains very, very low. I think that''s what makes me so enthusiastic, actually, about digital assets. So you''re enthusiastic that it''s boring and unused. I mean, what I find amazing is that there''s so many people excited about it, despite being so little use for it, actually, currently. It shows how much can be done, right? Because what do we have as real mainstream application today is many stable coins. And that''s what gets me excited. It''s like when we have so many expectations, so much hype on something because it makes so much sense, and yet it''s still used seldomly. It tells us how much more there is to build. And that gets me excited. Okay. So of the 10% roughly of the world population, they''re stoked about this because of the future potential of the technology and not for the fact that they can make money in seconds on meme coins? Henry? I think the meme coin was one of those things and still is one of those things that actually helped onboard a lot of people on chain. They might not even know they were interacting on chain. They might have just dropped a WhatsApp group message saying, here''s the CA, and they know CA means contract address, and here''s what I got to invest into. But I think the Binance numbers are quite aligned because as an exchange, we also face a number of the main market makers in the space, and they face obviously the retail traders. And the data that we see is anywhere between 200 to 300 people interact with trades, actually trading and investing in crypto. 200 million, you mean? 200 to 300 million, correct. That''s still a huge number. We''re talking about the essentially population of the United States, roughly 4% of the world''s population. Actively trading. That''s just remarkable. Michael, are you seeing similar numbers? Sure. I mean, again, if we are talking about user base, we have to define them, right? I mean, these 700, 800, close to a billion, whatever number, probably include a lot of people who at some point had a crypto account, or maybe they have bought some crypto, or tested it. But then you go down to the active trading number, like Henry mentioned, that number''s got to be a portion of that. Then you go further to people who actually have used crypto, maybe other than buying them on… Like payments, for example? Payments, or use it. Use DeFi on chain, or any type of game file, any type of application. I think that number become a fraction of that second number. So in that sense, right, back to your question where we are. I still think we''re very early. I still think we''re very early in terms of crypto being useful, in your words, right? Crypto utility is still very early. But, you know, to me, I''m actually very, very bullish on that growth, you know, probably 100-fold in the next couple of years. And we actually get to a point where… So crypto use will grow 100-fold? Crypto utility, yes. Beyond the crypto just being an investment or speculative asset. Okay, so let''s talk about that first. So, I mean, if… and tell me I''m wrong here, guys, but it seems like there are two killer use cases for crypto so far. One is as an actual store of value, as an asset of some sort. I mean, you can… you have to pay taxes on your crypto, that''s for sure. So the IRS''s of the world have already determined that this is a use case. And lots of people seem to be storing their wealth or making wealth simply by buying and hodling Bitcoin, for example. And then payments seem to be taking off, especially with stablecoins, but you guys would know better than me. I mean, these seem like real use cases now, even if not everyone''s using both. They are. They already are. I mean, what you''re saying on payments and stablecoins. Like we''re seeing at the OTC desk more and more, we''re no longer onboarding hedge funds that want to trade. We''re onboarding corporates that want to use crypto to do international payments. Are you really? We are, yeah. Like what… you don''t have to name names, I''m guessing you literally can''t. I won''t. But I''m saying what types of companies are you seeing as corporates? Industrial companies that have entities that we''re in the world and want to use crypto to assess… Like, I don''t know, I''m a restaurant group or I''m a supply chain company. You''re a large industrial company producing steel, whatever, and you''re in one country and have an entity in another. You want to be able to pay your suppliers fast, you want to be able to settle internationally fast. We''re seeing that now. It''s happening. Henry, we were talking backstage about international remittances. Again, this is one of those things that I''ve got to tell you. Back in 2014, 2015, we were told was the future. And then it never seemed to really materialize, although lots of companies kind of seem to bet the farm on that. But you''re telling me that it''s actually being used now and we''re seeing larger off-chain, meaning OTC-type transactions and volumes, and we''re even seeing on-chain. That''s right. I think it all gets reflected on-chain at one point, but a lot of these transactions are… They''re manufactured, they''re designed behind the scenes. So what you''re going to see is companies who have actually ever settled with another counterparty or paid and made any sort of payment, once they start using stablecoins, their experience, just like all of us, is a very positive one. Yeah. And then they never go back because it helps with the whole nature of crypto being very capital efficient. Right? Now I can maximize the utility of my cash, my treasury, instead of waiting for it to be stuck in an intermediary bank. And not only do I have that, I get everything accessed, like leverage, I get credit, I get all these better terms. Well, when they finally learn how to do that, I would say first, just using stablecoins to send money from A to B is such a better experience than wires. But then yield? Exactly. Sounds pretty great. I think, you know, David, you might have a slight different perspective on that than, you know, maybe the rest of us because you are American, right? So if you think about payments, the fundamental payment right now, right, we''re talking about stablecoins payments, right? It''s actually needed much more outside of the U.S. than inside of the U.S. Sure. Inside U.S. you already have electronic payments. You have Venmo, you have all of that. It''s already convenient enough, right? They may be getting it, they''re still terrible. I promise you. Well, there are definitely rooms to improve. But on the other hand, right, there are people who are outside the U.S. actually need stablecoins because of why they actually need dollar. Fundamentally, stablecoins are just dollar, yield bearing or not, putting onto the blockchain, right? So there are people who need dollar and therefore they use stablecoins. And secondly, there are people who need cross-border payments or the ability to get around all kinds of constraints, you know, legally or physically or, you know, cost-wise. All these constraints to make essentially dollar payments cross-border, right? So that''s why, you know, you see this kind of stablecoin or payments as a real utility much more outside the U.S. than inside the U.S. Interesting. So fundamentally, right, back to the point about crypto utility, you know, we need to really dig deep into what are the actual pain points. You can''t just say crypto is useful there, blockchain is useful there. In a general sense, I don''t think that''s how it should work. You need to actually understand, okay, what exact pain points is this particular crypto utility or this particular crypto application solving, right? So stablecoin, as we all explained, actually solved, you know, at least these two problems, right? There are people who need dollar and can''t get access to the dollar easily, so they go to stablecoins. There are people who need, you know, less constrained cross-border payments or reminitances, so they use stablecoins, whether these are corporates or individuals working overseas, right? Now, if you extend that logic to other crypto utilities, I think, you know, that can partially explain why some of the crypto utilities have taken off while others have not. So I want to explore the ones that haven''t taken off, okay? So not to, I want to actually pop a hole in this bubble here because I go to these conferences and all I hear is people clapping for crypto, talking about how great it is, how it''s the next big thing, and maybe it is the big thing now. But how many Web3 games are people actually playing? Okay? NFTs, remember when they were a big thing? What happened there? Memecoins seem to be having a bit of a moment right now. And so we''ve seen, like, all these other, I don''t know, highly touted use cases for crypto. And I''m not saying that they shouldn''t exist or won''t exist, but it doesn''t seem like they''ve taken off just yet, Kevin. Can I answer to that? I think it''s interesting because I think you somewhat already solved the panel with your previous statement about stablecoins. You can say, this was all the rage five years ago and then it didn''t happen. Well, yes, it did, but it took five years. You mean stablecoins? Yeah, exactly. Fine, that''s fair. That''s true. I think the logic is the same. So if you want to know what is going to happen in crypto and actually being used in the world in five years, it''s very easy. Just walk around and just look at all the promises that they give you. Like, this is happening now. Yeah, sure, honey. It''s happening in five years. That''s the most bullish statement I''ve ever heard. You should go booth to booth and whatever they say five years from now is going to be true. Exactly. It just takes time. It takes time to build something that is meaningful and that is actually useful. And that''s, I think, that dissonance is a bit where we are in crypto is that we believe that everything is going to happen in the next six months. And that''s because we''re used to having immediate liquidity on everything. But that''s not how it works. If you want to build something meaningful that actually has impact, it''s going to take time. So when they were promising international payment and remittance and so on, I mean, there was nothing. There was no liquidity. There was no stablecoin. There was no banking rails. There was no large otocidas. There was nothing. So, of course, that takes time to build. And so I think it''s the same thing here. All the use cases that you mentioned. I mean, NFTs were all the rage two years ago. And, of course, there was loads of BS around it. But at the end of the day, there was still something that made sense. I mean, how many 10,000 piece collections of fake frogs can you have? Of course. You have loads of bullshit around it. But there is, at the end, something that actually makes sense. It''s to have unique and digital together. And that is something that continues to grow. It''s simply, I think, the disappointment simply comes from the expected timeline. Fine, fine. So we have an ADD industry. That much is fair. But can we get a little bit more concrete here? So what is, and look, you''re probably going to be wrong just because predicting the future is inherently difficult. Five years from now, what''s a use case that should take off, kind of making it a little bit easier on you, that hasn''t taken off yet? Where people will actually be using crypto for it. Because again, this is the point of this panel. Henry, I''m putting you on the spot. Yeah. I think what will take off in the near future is your ability to collateralize your own assets. I''m not talking like RWA stuff. I think that''s very far away. I think I''m talking financial instruments. So you have to start at the top of the value chain when it comes to financial services. So how many banks will then own assets on behalf of clients that are in stable coins or in some sort of digital asset that can then be used to be leveraged and created other forms of financial instruments? So right now, that doesn''t exist much, especially because the US is the mecca for where all this financial activity takes place. I think with new administration and everything that''s happening, as banks are able to then be able to issue these instruments, people are able to own them. We''re able to see more and more leverage and finance. So essentially, you''re going to see people''s checking accounts turning into collateral for DeFi? Potentially. Potentially. I think. Or a version of that. Potentially. Because the institutions recognize it as an asset they can put a value on and give you an LTV for. Then once you use that, you might just hold it as a store of value. But now you''re able to be very capital efficient and start using this on everyday investments, lending, borrowing, things like that. But it has to start at the top of the top of the value chain. That''s why a lot of these things don''t take off. NFT is like you mentioned, health on the blockchain or whatever that means. Hey, I really do believe you should get paid for working out and walking. It does make sense. Someone should pay you to do the right thing. Maybe it''s your insurance company deducting. I mean, I don''t know. That''s just my opinion. OTC him a blocker stepping. Or whatever the newer version equivalent of that. Yeah, I actually agree with Henry. You know, I do think, you know, the tokenization. Or, you know, by tokenization, actually, what you get is digitalization and the financialization of all forms of assets. And therefore, you know, because hyper-financialized, you get a lot more liquidity, right? And, you know, hyper-financialized. Hyper-financialized. I like that phrase. So I do think that will happen because, you know, I think both the traditional financial industry are always incentivized to do that. Right? Even take crypto aside. Yeah, they are because they make points on every time they make a new product. Exactly. So, you know, I used to be a trader on the institutional side myself, right? And, you know, you look at the nature of trading, right? It''s about making money when there''s a transaction, right? That''s why, you know, when, even before crypto days, when, you know, sort of high-frequency trading or quantitative trading, if you guys read like Flash Boys and all of that, changed, you know, how they, changes the financial industry even before crypto, right? And, you know, that''s also happening through tokenization right now because you have things that was hard to financialize, things that traded at very lower frequency, right? You can always bother things, right? I have this water. I can always bother your, I don''t know, your watch or whatever, right? But like if you financialize it, you functionalize it, you digitize it, distribute it globally, of course there are going to be much higher frequency of transactions. So, I think, you know, you''ve created actual market structure around something that maybe didn''t have it before. Exactly. So, you know, back to NFT and I actually think meme coins today are somewhat of an extension of NFTs from last cycle, right? It''s basically tokenizing a lot of things that wasn''t financialized, right? You know, cloud, followers, attention, you know, arts, whatever you call it, or, you know, the ability to influence other people to buy. Usually things that are rather intangible. Sorry? Usually things that are rather intangible. Rather intangible or, you know, maybe they were financial in nature, they just need a medium to be more financial. Fair enough. Okay. So, you know, that''s why I think, you know, what Henry said will happen in the five years, right? The tokenization or digitalization or hyper-financialization things. So it''s hyper-financialization. I believe that, and the reason I buy that is because it does seem like the two main use cases we''ve talked about with crypto are financial in nature, right? One of them is growing your wealth and one of them is distributing it to a certain extent. So this makes sense to me. What about something just a little bit further? I mean, am I asking for too much for something like a use case for crypto that''s not just about making money? I think digital identity. Okay. So this is one, fine. I want to explore this. This is one we''ve been hearing about forever. Exactly. It takes time. The wonderful future where, you know, your identity is something that''s sovereign to you. This is going to happen? I think so, yeah. I mean, it''s extraordinarily needed. Especially now, I mean, half this world is talking about AI. So I think that, you know, being able to actually know who''s human or not and having your own sovereignty on your own data and your own identity is… This is what WorldCoin''s been pushing. Exactly, yeah. It''s tremendously needed. But again, it''s something that takes time. But I think the need is there. The logic of putting something that is both digital and unique together is there. So I think all the pieces of the puzzle are starting to be there for it to really take off, yeah. I actually have, like, a slight different perspective on that. I do believe in DID. I do think that''s a very needing structure. It probably happens. I think it very likely happens in the next five years. But I think the reason why it happens or who needs it… And when we say that, you mean, like, it''s going to be widely adopted within the next five years. That''s what you mean, correct? Yes, I do believe so. But again, you know, I don''t think the reason it happens is because people or humans need it. Humans do not care most of the time, right? If fundamentally take aside the financial… Humans don''t care about what? Humans do not care about privacy. They say they do. But most of the time, they do not, right? And fundamentally, the most essential… Do you guys believe this? That humans don''t care about privacy? Honestly, show of hands. Who here cares about privacy? Raise your hand. Well, let''s put it that way, right? I think privacy is a luxury. If you do, how many of you click reject cookies every time you open your website? Oh, shit. No, no, no. You''re all lying now. I don''t believe you at all. Okay. Right. If you''re going to get paid $10 a month, if whatever app you''re already using that''s probably already stealing your data, openly say we will take your data. Yeah. Okay. Fine, fine. You win this one. I think it''s starting to change, though. Because once you have your own data and you can actually monetize it, the reason is now you''re being robbed and you don''t even know about it. Yeah, but I see. I don''t buy that one. I want you to continue your point, then I can find a girlfriend. Oh, no worries. So fundamentally, right, why we need the blockchain, it''s more costly, right, by definition. You put an application on blockchain, it''s more costly, right? And then no matter what layer one solutions you use, essentially you''re trading off efficiency and the cost there, right? Yes. For security, for immutability. Less so security. Security, yes, maybe. It depends on how you define security. Fundamentally, I think you trade that off for permissionlessness and trustlessness, right? And these two things, most human consumers really do not care. If they don''t have access to a product, they say, okay, you know, I use some other product. Most people just move on and get around that. Most people, again, back to privacy or trust, our life fundamentally today, the society has formed in a way that we are so used to give away that trust. That''s just how we function today, right? Okay, fair enough. I don''t think five years, you know, the human society is going to change that dramatically, right? But a different group of users will care about that a lot fundamentally, which are the AI agents. Aliens. Okay. And I do firmly believe that. So I do think DID will happen because I also have a very aggressive view of, you know, where we are in five years in terms of, you know, how much of the economy is agents driven rather than human driven. I think, you know, the more than half or the majority of the economy in five years will be agent driven. And for them, permissionlessness and trustlessness are actual fundamental necessities. So I think things like DID and, you know, streaming payments or, you know, all the fractionalized, digitalized payments are very much needed because they need that. I actually think most human consumers, maybe high networks do, maybe- So AI is going to need crypto. AI will need crypto. And the crypto utilities will happen because agents need them rather than human consumers need them. So five years from now, you think there''s going to be a lot of crypto use, but mostly AI agents using the crypto. Yes. And we will benefit from that because they, at least in my view, will be the majority of the economy. Henry, what do you think? Yeah, it''s hard to disagree against that. I think it might happen faster than five years in some form or another. When we go back to talk about currencies, right, the currency that transacts at an AI agent level is crypto. It''s not fiat. Human beings are definitely fiat currencies. We created the fiat currency. We are bound by the flaws of the fiat currency. But I think AI agents, they''re silicon beings. They''re not human beings. And that''s the official currency of the silicon world, right? And that''s going to be how they interact because programmable money, it''s like programmable intelligence. It has to go together. I don''t know whether to be scared or impressed. I''ve got to say- I think we just got to embrace it. It''s going to happen one way or the other. Yeah. You know, it seems realistic enough. And then the question is, what are they going to be paying in? Is Dogecoin going to be the currency of choice for the AI overlords? They''re going to- What is interesting here is, in the concept, is how value is represented. It''s the fact that it''s digitally represented, it''s therefore programmable, and then it can be used, you know, by digital agents. But then what do you put in the bucket of value? That depends, right? But I don''t think that the fact that it''s digitally represented doesn''t change what you attribute value to. And that remains, I guess, scarcity, potential users, and so on and so forth. And so I don''t think that because something can be digitally represented, all of a sudden the sense of community that you may have in a meme coin is going to be the source of value that you want to transact with. I personally don''t think so. But what''s interesting is that it''s digital. Yeah, I would see you agree. I mean, I can''t imagine AI agents, at least much more sophisticated ones, are going to be valuing tokens the same way that today an average crypto investor would, right? Looking at the number of people in a telegram group and using that as a proxy for determining the potential value of something. If I was an AI agent, I wouldn''t think that way. But actually, you know, Kevin, you mentioned how you see value, right? I''m a big believer in value. I actually think, you know, this is what our industry need now. We need to return to value, return to long termness. But on the other hand, you can''t deny liquidity and hyper-financialization, again, brings liquidity. Liquidity adds value by itself, right? Something that''s much more liquid intrinsically has higher value than the same thing that''s much less liquid. You''re saying you pay a premium for liquidity. And that premium is not small in today''s world. In today''s world, if you have liquidity, it means the exchange of information is going to be a lot faster. Because whenever you make a transaction, you''re exchanging, essentially you''re exchanging data, right? The currency you pay, whether that''s fiat or, you know, Bitcoin, Ethereum, whatsoever, right? Is the data of some future spending power, right? And you get something in return, right? So I actually think, you know, the hyper-financialization is natural because we''re already living in a society that''s more and more digitalized. And as things are digitalized, back to what you said, right? We are not used to price them because they used to be somewhat valuable, but they were not liquid. But now they are both valuable and, you know, they''re liquid, right? We''re forced to price them 24-7. We''re forced to transact them 24-7 in a programmable way. So, you know, back to what you said, I mean, whether meme coin whatsoever, right? I do understand today the trading mechanism or, you know, the liquidity distribution mechanism or meme coin is probably fraud. And it has a lot to be... Alright, well that''s a whole other panel discussion, okay? That''s true. One thing is, and believe me, liquidity is my business, so I agree that it has value. But I think that what liquidity gives you is the ability to transact easily, right? So all other things being equal, something that is easily transactable is going to have more value. But if you have something that you don''t even want to transact with in the first place because it''s absolutely useless, liquidity doesn''t make it, doesn''t give it use. Well, as long as there''s one person in the whole world who want to buy something, it has value, right? You have to agree with that. But I think that if you have all other things being equal, liquidity adds additional value. Yes. But it doesn''t create value out of the air. It''s why my plane ticket costs more if it''s refundable than if it''s not. Exactly. But if you don''t have a plane ticket and you have just a horse ticket or whatever, the fact that it''s liquid doesn''t make it valuable to you if you want to go back to the US, right? No question about that. Okay. So let''s go back to the topic here for a moment, guys. Five years from now, how many people, people, we''ve already kind of measured it at about a billion or fewer, will have crypto in their portfolios or will be using crypto in some way? Throw a number out there. Kevin, starting with you. What''s the number on traditional assets today? Probably like 30% of the world? Like if I take my reasoning, I guess in five years we''re going to have what people are claiming we have today. So with that, I could go with 700 million, which is 10%. I do think it''s going to be higher than that, so I would go with 25%, 30%. So 2 billion. Excellent. There you go. Michael? I actually think it''s going to be a larger number than people who have financial access today. Because one, like Henry said, a lot of the financial services we use today, I do think they''ll be tokenized. Whether we call it crypto or not, in five years, I don''t know. But I do think they will be tokenized in some form. And then secondly, of course, you add more access to people who are unbanked. Again, one of the crypto resources is to bank the unbanked. So a lot of the unbanked today are already being banked by crypto. So I actually think the number is going to be larger than whatever number is today for the whole financial services use base. And Henry? We always go by base cases. So my hope is the base cases, one to five percent, interact with it directly, knowingly. 10 to 20 to 25 percent are indirectly accessing services. Well, then it does seem like it''s still early innings over here. Gentlemen, thank you very much for talking about the future of crypto. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thanks everyone. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('22316b5e59', 'Empowering Global Food Chain Through Technology', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Music Morning everybody. I guess as we get started I just want to paint a picture. We work in the agriculture and food world. And over the last four years we''ve been building an agricultural and food platform. It''s web 3 and mobile. And we have about 2 million users of our platform around the world. And are growing very quickly. The thing I want you to think about is the agricultural space lags from a technology perspective. Right now there''s about 570 million farmers in the world producing a lot of the world''s produce. We''re connected to them in 35 projects around the world right now. And we''re adding projects every month. You know just to paint a picture of this world. The user is detached from technology. They have difficulty accessing financing. They have difficulty working with various regulations. And our platform helps manage all of that for them. So we typically work with cooperatives and big huge food companies to bring this technology to small farmers in Africa and Asia and South America and Americas and Europe. And it''s pretty exciting. So today a couple of my team members are here with me. You see our pictures up on the board. So we don''t need to introduce ourselves. Andreas is going to moderate. And we''re just going to talk about this and give you some time to ask questions after. Thank you, John. And thank you guys for showing up today. So to summarize this, what we''re talking about here is reaching 570 million farmers globally that are not even in Web 1.0. And we''re talking about automating services to take them from not being online to Web 3.0 services that you all think about and work on. So that''s what we''re going to talk about here. Thank you for coming. And we''re kicking it off to give you an example on how we scale this. What is the technology we use on the ground to scale that impact? And Carlotta, our director for ESG, she''s creating our product on an ESG platform for Dimitra. And she can tell us a little bit about that. Tell us. Thank you very much, Andreas. Nice seeing you all here. Well, ESG stands for Environment, Social, and Governance, as some of you might know. But it''s really all about sustainability. So what we want to do at Dimitra is indeed leveraging cutting-edge technology, such as artificial intelligence or blockchain technology, to really enable a successful, sustainable, and also very accessible solution for farmers globally to onboard and to actually access more benefits from the market. So we have different real-world impact projects. Like John mentioned, we have a global presence. And for instance, we just launched a project with Brazil, the biggest association of fruits, whereby we are helping them to actually bridge the gap between what they''re already doing successfully in terms of sustainability, from water management to well-being in the workforce to good governance, to actually being able to show that transparently and with accountability onto the blockchain. And that''s just one example. But we can talk about many others. So in that project, we''re turning data points that they''re already working on on their farm, in their production of food, into a protocol that we can then do statistics on for them and for their group to improve their ESG levels. So, John, we have a wheel up here of all that great technology that you and your team are envisioning for the future and that you''ve already implemented in some of these real-world projects on a large scale. I mean, we''re already talking to 2.5 million users today. And we''re scaling up to about 100 million in the next two years. So here we are. Tell us about that technology and what''s the biggest impact that you see that needs to happen now on the ground. Well, I think there''s a lot of technology that we''ve got up here. These are applications. These are components of our applications. And most of those have already been built and have been beta tested or actually live. AI this year is one of our biggest impacts. And we''re building three AI protocols this year. You know, I''ll give you an example of one of those. We have a group of 150,000 farms run by or invested in by a bank in Brazil. And this bank needs data on the performance of those farms. So we have a yield estimation process that we''ve developed with a little bit of input from the farmer satellite and some other statistical information that we analyze that an individual can go in, you know, with a token, buy, or a bank can buy a report every month that comes out on the farm, on the performance, and the prediction of the output of that farm. So great tool for investors, great tool for lenders, great opportunity to set up various lending pools and Web3 crypto pools that we can empower with these predictive tools. And we''ve got those first 150,000 farms set up for that right now. So we''re building this protocol to automate that. And it''s already been built and tested. We''ve just got to get through the protocol final testing. So we''re talking about automating small-scale financing for the farmer. And they might be looking for $100, $200, $500 that they need to advance them to the next harvest. So automating those processes that are too costly for the old-world banking system, that''s where we''re interested in looking at new technologies and new partners to automate that process for the farmer that''s not yet digitized. And what''s then the next step to making a real-world impact for the farmer, monetizing other things that they do? Yeah, I mean, carbon credits is one that''s great. And Carlotta''s got a lot of involvement in our carbon credit program. Most farms in the world can''t access a carbon credit program, although they do very carbon-positive activities on their farm, like planting trees. An individual farm can''t offset the cost of applying for carbon credits based on what they might earn from a carbon credit perspective. You know, your typical one-acre or one-hectare farm might earn $40 in carbon credits per year. We''ve got a project in Ethiopia right now where we''ve got a contract with a group of cooperatives, 1.2 million farms, and we can offset all of that cost, digitize that on a 10-year contract. So each one of those farmers, if they plant 30 trees depending on the species of tree, may earn a carbon credit. And they get that every year for 20 years as long as they''re part of the program. So, you know, that carbon credit today is worth around $20. If you plant hundreds of trees, you know, they can make even hundreds of dollars. And that''s a supplement to their farm income. And that''s a big supplement. If you consider that their profit currently starts at about $600 a year for a coffee farmer, that''s how much they''re making in profit a year. So the impact of $40 to $100 a year, free money, is huge for that community. And that''s what we''re automating here. And if I may add something to that as well. Please do. I think the Dimitra AI is also very interesting when it comes to truly empowering smallholder farmers with insights based on data-driven takeaways, basically. So what we''re trying to do, for instance, in Kenya, we had a project that is called One Million Avocados, whereby, via our app, we actually help farmers to identify what is the best suitability in terms of land and water resources and how to plant the avocado trees and where specifically so that they could actually increase their yield longer term. So this is, again, an example of how high-tech or cutting-edge technology can really be used on a day-to-day basis for farmers. So to translate it for my 10-year-old niece, maybe, so you have farmers that don''t have the money to plant new avocado trees because it takes two years to produce avocados. So they don''t invest $100 into that tree. We do what, John? What do we do? Well, I mean, we went out and bought 10,000 trees and we gave them to farmers as an investment. And that''s one of the things we do at Dimitra. We went out and planted those trees with them. And we take a 20% yield from the tree. The farmer gets the tree, which they typically would never plant, and just because of the duration of the investment. And we earn an ongoing investment. And investors in us earn an ongoing investment in those trees. So we created NFTs around each tree that we invested in, but that we have on our marketplace to also have other investors invest in, correct? Yeah. We have a similar project in Brazil. So one of the state governments of Brazil, Araima Brazil, wants to grow their cocoa production. So working with that state government, working with a government agency on fruit, working with a government agency on small business, we have a program where we are looking to plant maybe 300,000 cocoa trees over the next few years in Brazil. So the investors would invest in that and earn a yield back based on the cocoa production. And if you guys know, cocoa last year went through the roof in price, right? Our chocolate bars are going up in price. It''s a problem for me. But as we go through this, people have an opportunity to invest in cocoa. Cocoa outperformed from a total price perspective Bitcoin last year. And saw about a 9x in one year in price. It''s very lucrative to plant cocoa now. And there''s a lot of problems. And we have technology, you know, and Carlotta alluded to our AI. We have AI to help farmers combat and have early warning systems for cocoa black pod disease, which is one of the reasons we''re having these problems for climate change. I mean, there''s lots of reasons. And you may want to touch more on some of the AI stuff. Yeah, yeah. No, that''s very interesting, actually. In terms of predictive analysis, AI can really combat a lot of different climate change issues that can be mitigated by farmers who actually do not have previous knowledge on it. Because we do not expect farmers in developing countries to have a very high education. But via our app, via knowledge sharing, in a very easily accessible way via the app, farmers all of a sudden can access these kind of insights and can actually do something about mitigating climate change, for instance. But also, AI can help them to detect diseases. So we had another project with citrus diseases in Brazil, whereby by taking a picture, a farmer could actually detect ahead of time what kind of trees had to cut down in order to not let the pest spread in the farms. And I think all of these more data-driven insights are all of a sudden accessible and democratized, if you want to use this world nowadays, to smallholder farmers. And that''s really our mission. So this is the essence of what we do. We take complex technology and complex knowledge and automate it through technology to transfer it to a farmer that we are taking by the hand onto a digital journey that they''re not on yet. So to the community, it''s always interesting to talk to, what are the partners you''re looking for, John, at an event like this? Who are the interesting partners that you might bring in to collaborate on a project basis? Well, I think, you know, we''re always looking at technology partners. Who brings another comparable technology or something that''s going to support our mission? And that can be on the financing side. We look at individual financing on individual projects. One of the partners we have is the United Nations. They have hired us and are using our application in South America. They just gave us another project that there will be some announcements on shortly. And then they''re currently expanding the initial software that we provided them. So we''ve got three contracts with the United Nations in the last year. You know, we''re looking at how do you finance individual projects? Ethiopia, for example, we''re doing this carbon project for 1.2 million farms. It costs us about $11 in order to onboard a farm. And then that project will yield somewhere in the $40 to $50 million a year range for 10 years, as long as those farmers are participating. And there''s no reason for them not to participate because it supplements their income. So that means, just as an example for those of you that are in this space, we''re looking for a project partner for that project in Ethiopia to provide a liquidity pool of 10 to 15 million to kick off that onboarding of these 1.2 million farmers for a project that will yield 40 to 50 million in revenue each year over 10 years. That''s what we''re talking about. Yeah, and we''ve already kicked it off because we''ve made a personal investment. We''ve hired teams at three of the cooperatives in Ethiopia, and they''re out gathering the data already at some of those farms. So we''re targeting right now this month to have about 10,000 farms registered and signed up for the program. Although they''ve already signed the contract, we have to visit the farm and we have to get a geofence of the farm. And then we have auditors, and we have to meet certain audit requirements to get those carbon credits over time. So there''s an annual audit requirement. But the project is going. And the cool thing about that project is it piggybacks onto all this other software. So Andreas was recently promoted. He''s our head of sales globally, and he ran our European division. And one of our products up here is for compliance. And we have an EUDR project. And EUDR is a deforestation regulation that every farm in the world that sells seven different products, coffee, cocoa, or some of them soybean, needs to comply with if they''re going to ship their products to Europe. And so we enable that. And not only do we enable it to the farmer, we enable it to the coffee company. So Andreas and his team have gone out and signed up a number of large coffee traders, coffee farming organizations, roasters. And each one of those organizations sign up with us and give us thousands and thousands of farms to do the analysis. This year we''re building a protocol for that. So we enabled it in a Web 2 method. Now the AI is working. So now we''re enabling it through a protocol. And they''ll be able to issue a geofence or a grouping of geofences and receive a report back and say, here''s your 3,600 farms on your report. 200 of them are not compliant. And here''s their compliance issues. And how much value does that create for your coffee customer or your cocoa customer? Well, it creates the value that we also take them by the hand from Web 1.0 to Web 3.0 by automating those services of data analysis. So we''re talking about, in summary, they need to provide traceability to the farm level. They need to define a geofence around the farm. And we analyze that geofence if there was deforestation done since 2020. And the companies in Europe, the big roasters and traders, are incapable of understanding that that requires investment into the farming community to get that data. And that''s what we''re bridging, that gap of understanding, of taking also that customer in Europe by the hand into Web 3.0. And what is that journey in your mind for the farmer? And why are you so passionate, John, about the farmer? Well, I mean, there''s a couple reasons. One is I grew up on my grandfather''s farm. And so I love farming. Maybe when I was young and I was a computer programmer, I didn''t love farming so much and wanted to escape that world a little bit. But then, you know, the allure of farming became important to me. Over my years, I''ve been building software systems and built a number of ERP systems, business and logistic systems, for some of the biggest players in the world. And I spent a lot of time consulting in that area. And as I was doing that, we would work on food systems with big food players. And I found there was always a data disconnect between the farmer and the large food company. And enabling and closing that data disconnect gives us reams and reams of really valuable data. Data that we can do other things with. Data that we can monetize with universities, helping research, helping improve productivity on the farm. But the most important thing to me is every day I get up and I''m super excited about helping these farmers. You know, I did a project a number of years ago in the Congo. The government of Congo asked me to go. I spent a bunch of time there. And the farmers are so hardworking. You know, the average income of the farmer was about $600 a year. If we can increase their productivity, even if we increase their productivity 20%, and they were grossing, you know, $3,000 a year and netting $600 a year, that''s a huge impact. That doubles their take-home income. And that helps them build their community. And it''s amazing, these farming communities around the world and how they support each other. And it''s just like the crypto community. This is a community-based environment. And it''s just as easy for us, and maybe we do some extra work for it, to go and work with these organizations and help them improve their productivity. But it''s a great application for AI. It''s a great application for mobile. And it''s a great application for crypto. And thank you for that. That''s the reason I joined Dimitra two years ago. Because he''s so rooted in that community that we''re trying to help. I am, by the way, as well. I grew up in Germany in a farming community. But Carlotta, what excites you about Dimitra? Because you joined quite recently in October of last year. Yeah, indeed. I was not fortunate enough to be living on a farm growing up, but I would have loved to. And I think generally reconnecting to the land is very important. And what I found out around six years ago, I got into blockchain and crypto. And what really stuck with me was this protocol that I read on Ethereum that was enabling access for women to get loans in India. So entrepreneurs from the other gender could all of a sudden access finance. And so I got captivated by the crypto space because of the democratizing access that it gives. And then when it comes to agriculture, there are so many applications for it. And I thought, why not combining the both of them? Because I think empowering smallholder farmers is extremely important considering the numbers. And I do love to eat. I''m a foodie, honestly. So I care for food and I care for having traceable, organic, and I would say just sustainable food systems on our planet. Thank you for that, Carlotta. That''s their driver. My driver is meeting people and connecting people in the real world. And I have new friends that I made yesterday. I''m going to have many more new friends made today. So I want to reach out to you guys. Help us make that connection between your brains and your brain pool of your teams and our projects to take those farmers by the hand and guide them in a secure way onto the digital journey that we''ve been on all our lives. Thank you, guys. And I want some questions, one or two questions from the audience. Who''s got a question for me? For John, for Carlotta? It''s 2,000 people thinking. It''s 2,000 people. There''s a lady. Thank you. Please, the microphone runner. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for your contributions. I was wondering, what is the one project that you are most proud of? Because you''ve been mentioning a whole bunch. Thanks. What are you most proud of, Carlotta? Well, I just came in as a director of ESG. So, of course, I''m proud of our collaboration with the biggest association of fruits in Brazil. I think we''re really going to be leading and revolutionizing sustainability in the fruit industry as Brazil is one of the major exporters of fruits. So that''s my own bias. Favorite project. I think that that''s a great project. And we went out and got Carlotta to come on and run this program. I''m so excited to have her. We worked with her on another project elsewhere. And she''s amazing to talk to. So please take the time to talk to her if you see her walking around here. Don''t underestimate Brazil. Brazil is the third largest exporter of fruit in the world. Our organization that signed us is the organization that manages 80% of the exports of fruit from Brazil. And they have a vision to work with everybody who buys Brazilian fruit in the world to comply with and be audited to a certain level from an ESG perspective. And there''s regulations coming out on this. So today people are doing ESG because investors want it, because it''s important to them, and because it''s the right thing for the earth. But in a year and a half... It will be mandatory. It''ll be mandatory for them. So imagine all of the fruits that are exported from Brazil will be running through our program in a year and a half. We have other organizations in the world that do that. And so I''m proud of it. One, because I get to work with Carlotta. But two, Brazil''s an amazing country to work with, and we have a lot of great relationships there. You know, I''m proud of our RWA program in Kenya. And we have this young, passionate guy. We went and partnered with a group there called One Million Avocados. And it was a young guy who loves avocados, created an organization to go and help avocado farmers. And an avocado farmer in Kenya makes about 50 cents a pound, or sorry, per kilo per avocados. On export, if we can prepare them for export and comply for ESG and comply for deforestation compliance, they can make about three times that amount of money. So if I look at an organization that has, I think, 57,000 farmers in Kenya that focus on avocado, taking them from 50 cents, when they have a landed cost to them of over 40 cents for an avocado, to $1.50 or $1.30, whatever price we can get in, depending on the market that day, by helping them digitize their process is really rewarding to me. And so the most rewarding thing to me is taking somebody who, with a little bit of technology and a little bit of effort, throw some AI at it, and a mobile app, simple mobile app that they can use, and tripling their income is super rewarding. I''ve been in tech my whole life, and it''s been a rewarding career for me. But the reason I moved away from big tech and most of my stuff has been enterprise, enterprise tech, is the ability to help people. Because when I was working for the big corporation, yeah, people were using the app, and a lot of Americans and Europeans were using the app, but in all reality, I never really felt like I made a big difference in their life. And what we do today feels like I can make a big difference in their life. Thank you for that. And thank you for that question. I''m very proud of the Ethiopian Coffee Project where we''re onboarding 1.2 million farmers right now. And I''m so excited to find the right partners that understand trade financing and this world to provide that liquidity pool for the next 18 to 24 months. That''s what I''m interested in right now and very excited. One more question. 90 seconds. Yeah, hi. Yeah, hi. I''m very new to the Web3 space, so this question may be a bit silly. I think I get what you''re doing, that you''re allowing access, easy access to data both ways. How do you ensure that that data is correct to begin with? So data on, I think you were talking about sustainability in farms and that there wasn''t deforestation. How are you auditing and checking that before that data gets onto the chain? And have you ever run into any problems with that? Short answer. Yeah, so there''s a lot of ways we validate it. Very first thing we do when a farm registers is we take a satellite snapshot of that farm and we built AI protocols to count the number of trees on the farm, to look at the canopy coverage on the farm. What percentage canopy coverage do they have? We can count the number of palm oil trees or the number, you know, and predict the yield. So we have a lot of algorithms that we''ve built in order to assess each individual farm from a sustainability perspective and from a productivity perspective. And then we back that up through an on-the-ground audit program. So Ethiopia, for example, each one of those cooperatives that we''re working on has auditors that go out. So we have service technicians. And then third, through, you know, Vera and different groups, gold standard, depending on the protocol, we need to follow a certain audit requirements as maybe 5% need to be audited or 10% need to be audited. We continue. Go find John. We can talk. Go find us. As we are out of time, it felt like a CrossFit workout where I have 10 seconds left and he''s going long. So thank you guys for being here. Please come see us. Talk to us. We''re here the next two days. Looking forward to it. Have a successful show. Thank you very much. We can just go right out here after. Like I saw, there were some other hands. Let''s talk. Happy to talk right now. Thank you. Have fun. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('3d55705a35', 'USDC as a Platform for Global Prosperity', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' All right. Good to see everyone. It''s always good to be back in Hong Kong as someone who was born here, spent quite a bit of time here. And I also want to give a shout-out to ConsenSys, to Coindesk, to Bullish for putting this together and putting ConsenSys here in Hong Kong. It''s a really terrific event. So I''m going to give you the punchline. The first punchline is 56 billion. 56 billion is currently the market cap of USDC. It is an all-time high that we hit about a week or so ago, and it''s what everyone seems to be talking about. But 56 billion masks what is really happening behind the scenes with USDC, with stablecoins, and with the partners that we''ve been working with all around the world, including the ones here in Hong Kong. 56 billion is just the total market capitalization of USDC globally. But did you know that there are now over $23 trillion worth of on-chain transaction that''s been done using USDC? This is different from where we were two, three years ago in the last cycle. USDC is also on more chains than ever. We''re now on 18 chains globally, and we''re being used across 100-plus countries around the world. Today, there are nearly 4 million wallets around the world that actually hold and use USDC. So 56 billion tends to be what people think about, but to build a real stablecoin business, it''s about all the other aspects, the other metrics that we think about every day as a team. Now, what makes 56 billion possible? USDC is a digital dollar on the Internet, and there are two important aspects about it. The first aspect, it''s around dollar stability. And first and foremost, I want to know, and as you probably know, that we are the largest regulated dollar in the world. We''re regulated by regulators in the U.S., in Singapore, in Europe, and soon other places as well. We are backed one-to-one with reserves that are being held in institutions like BlackRock, as well as financial institutions, GSIPS, around the world. That gives our users, our developers, the trust that they need when they use USDC. The other piece is probably the most obvious to most folks here in this room, because you''re here at ConsenSys, and that''s the blockchain efficiency. And that''s the ability to have dollars that settle 24-7 at near instant rates. There are fewer intermediaries that move between you and who you''re sending your money to, and there''ll be lower costs when you send that money. These two together is actually what makes USDC unique. Another way to think about it is that we''re building the payments protocol for the Internet. And as we think about that, this is really not just a conversation around USDC. This is really a conversation on a broader stablecoin network. Many people actually come up to us and ask, why don''t you launch Hong Kong dollar stablecoin or XYZ stablecoin? Stablecoins in various different currencies. Now, we believe that the world eventually will move in that direction. We specialize in the largest regulated dollar stablecoin, and we also issue the euro stablecoin, EURC. But what we expect to see is actually many more stablecoins in different denominations to pop up all around the world. And we expect all of these stablecoins to be built up to the right standards and be able to operate on open blockchains permissionlessly. And that''s actually the future of what the stablecoin network will look like. One common question that I get, and many of you probably get, is what are stablecoins used for? We actually heard some of it throughout the day from the panelists earlier, which is terrific. But I do want to just highlight a couple of buckets where USDC is being used. And I put them in general in three large buckets. The first one is around digital assets and the capital markets around that. The second piece is consumer payment solutions. And then the third piece is around cross-border payments. And let me dive into a couple of those and then do a little case study around the cross-border payments piece. On the digital asset side, this is where most of the stablecoin adoption started, where on the digital trading, there was a need for settlement 24-7. As traders, market makers, others, needed to be able to get in and out of positions, whether it''s Bitcoin, Ethereum, Sol, or other type of various tokens. They needed a way to settle those trades real time and immediately. So stablecoin was actually born out of that. And there, we''re working with a number of partners. A couple of those are highlighted. That includes Binance, DRW, Bison Digital, and there are many, many others as well, where we''re working with them to enable the usage of USDC to help them as well as their partners to be able to settle and trade with USDC. The second bucket is actually quite interesting. The second bucket is probably where most of you didn''t think existed or people who are not in the industry didn''t think existed. And there, we actually have many different examples. Some of these Hong Kong-based companies that are using Web3 solutions to go through their digital transformation and move to the next phase of finance. These are companies like Hong Kong Telecom, REAP, these are companies all based here, as well as global companies like MasterCard, Visa, that are using USDC for settlement within their network. And then we have companies in more emerging markets, such as Nubank or Grab, that are using our Web3-related services and are using USDC as a way to provide dollar savings, dollar holdings for their users. Most recently, we also announced a partnership in the Middle East with Lulu, and we''re looking forward to working with them to enable USDC use through their users. But what we''ve seen in all of these use cases is that these are companies who are either telcos or Web2 wallets, fintechs in the last generation, that are actually upgrading and moving to the next phase. And they''re doing this both through various Web3 services, technologies that enable them to build on blockchains, as well as use stablecoins on their network. And most people focus on the first piece, or the last piece, which is the use of USDC, but they forget that many of these corporates, large enterprises, need help to actually get to that next phase. They need technology solutions, they need consultants, they need builders to be able to help make that transition. For some of the folks in the room, you''re familiar of building on blockchains. For some of these enterprises, it''s actually quite hard. They do not have the talent, they don''t have the controls in place, they may not have compliance built in in the first place. So what we''re doing is actually providing some technology services that help these companies make that transition. We help abstract away some of those blockchain complexities on how you build, how you get to finality, how you think of compliance, how you address travel rule, all of those things that are really important in the movement of value, we abstract that into APIs that these companies in the middle are using. And they''re building this for millions of users around the world. Lastly, I want to talk about cross-border payments. This is probably one of the most exciting parts for the use of stablecoin. I''m going to start with MoneyGram because MoneyGram is an old school business. You wouldn''t think an old remittance company would be moving and using stablecoins. But they are, and they''re actually doing this in places that are probably the highest impact. We have a partnership with MoneyGram, together with Stellar, and the UNHCR, the UN High Commission on Refugees, that actually provides aid, dollars, to Ukrainian refugees that are going through the war there. And they''re able to receive aid directly from the UN and be able to send and use those money on the network, on Stellar, and then be able to off-ramp at any MoneyGram location around the world. They can show up at a MoneyGram in Ukraine. They can show up at a MoneyGram in France. They can show up at a MoneyGram here in Hong Kong and be able to convert the USDC into local currency and be able to spend it in real world. And that''s actually really important. Second piece, and I don''t need to dive into this, is Stripe. Everyone has been talking about the Stripe acquisition of Bridge that was really the shot heard around the world around the use of stablecoin to help companies like Stripe, but really their partners, their merchants, to be able to accept payments anywhere in the world with USDC, with stablecoin, and then be able to send it and pay out to all of their merchants around the world that depend on that money for working capital and to pay their suppliers and to be able to pay for goods. Lastly, I want to dive into Tunes. We announced a partnership with Tunes last October, so just a couple months ago, which I believe was quite transformative in thinking about and having a great use case of how USDC and stablecoins are being used to enable faster commerce and faster payments. Tunes is a B2B company that moves money for many of the remittance companies around the world as well as payment companies around the world. Their network includes Grab, Deliveroo, it includes Remitly, MoneyGram, Western Union. You don''t hear about them because they work on the background, but what they provide is the ability to do instant payouts all around the world across 100-some countries, dollars or local fiats into whatever the local payment form would be, directly into bank accounts or into wallets that are being used like GCash by local users. They came to us with a question. They are providing a lot of this through pre-funding at the edge of the network and on weekends in particular, but really throughout the week, it''s really hard to move money from the west to the east. Every day, they have to think about and plan their timing to move funds in New York with a large bank that have been debanking some of the crypto companies that are coming back, but you know who it is. They have to move money there by 4 or 4.30 in order for it to get to Asia T plus 2, two days later. And that''s a particular problem on weekends where when they move money on a Friday, it''s already Saturday in Asia. And that money actually doesn''t arrive until Monday at the soonest, if not Tuesday. And all of that is actually working capital costs for them and or for their partners. They''re also moving money from around the world over to Africa. And that settlement time can go up to T plus 5. So what they did is they came to us and they said, hey, there''s this thing called stable coin. You can settle immediately. Why don''t we use it in our treasury to be able to move funds around the world? So that was exactly the partnership. They''re now using USDC and settling millions of dollars a day using USDC all around the world to many of the emerging markets in Southeast Asia as well as markets in Africa and other places. But they went a step further. They realized that for some of the payers into the system, they were having pre-funding problems. So now they''re talking with a lot of companies who have started to turn on to fund them using USDC. So we now have two sides of the lake where the payers are minting USDC in the US or in Europe, be able to send it directly to them and then they''re able to move that money over to Asia near instant and then be able to pay out in local fiat wherever they are. This 24-7 settlement is really changing how they''re operating, how efficient they can be, lowering their capital costs. More importantly, it''s increasing some of the quality of service for the end customers, especially those in emerging markets. What''s ahead? First and foremost, as the last panel had talked about, regulations are changing. It''s impossible in the last couple months to talk about regulation without what''s going on in the US. And for those of you who have been watching, now there are bills in Congress around stable coins explicitly. And if the AI and crypto czar manages to deliver on the promise, there should be a stable coin bill before the president''s desk within the first 100 days of the administration. That will set probably a pretty clear standard in terms of what a well-regulated stable coin would look like. And it''s going to have a great impact not just in the United States, but really around the world. The US is actually behind here. Some of the other jurisdictions have been implementing or working through regulations. In Europe, they''ve been working on something called Mika, which came into effect actually in July 1st, 2024. Circle was the first global issuer that was able to come into compliance with Mika and were able to issue both USDC as well as EURC, our Eurostable coin, in that framework. And many of the virtual asset providers, or they call them crypto asset service providers, came into compliance at the end of last year. We started seeing exchanges delisting stable coins that were not Mika compliant and moving their treasury and other things into compliant stable coins. And that''s the direction that we expect to see. We heard earlier, a couple panels ago, the CEO of Vara. There in the Middle East, there are regulations coming into place as well on stable coins. We actually announced that we''re setting up an office in Abu Dhabi. Closer to home, I''ll start with Japan. Japan has a stable coin law in effect, and the FSA has actually published guidelines for what a well-regulated stable coin will look like. And stay tuned, you''ll be hearing from us soon about what will happen in Japan. And then it''s important to also talk about Hong Kong. Hong Kong is working through its legislation for stable coin. The regulators here actually have a couple months lead time in putting that into place. They''re working hard down the street over at Letchco to work through the details of that stable coin bill. And it''s a terrific bill that actually sets a high standard of what a well-regulated stable coin will look like. And there''s similarities in terms of how they''ve set that up with the U.S. framework and with the Japan framework and with the European framework. So what we''re seeing actually is that you can call it coordination, but at least a matching of high standards all around the world in terms of how stable coins will be regulated and what sort of stable coins will be interoperable across different jurisdictions. And that''s really important as you think about the businesses that you''ll build and the medium of exchange that you''ll be able to use on your network. Last but not least, and I''ll close with this slide, we''re just getting started. Those use cases that I talked about are the ones that we''re seeing today. As regulation come into place, as the enterprises build their Web3 wallets, build their platforms, we expect to see more settlement and more transactions happening on-chain. This will include companies that are either small, medium, or large holding their treasuries with stable coins on-chain because it''s faster to move them across jurisdiction than it was with banking. They''re able to then use these stable coins to move into investments as they need and to be able to move out of these investments like tokenized money market funds 24-7. We''re going to see more on-chain payments. We''re just getting started. We have these partners all around the world that are receiving and sending with USDC. As the regulation becomes clear and as more partners come into the network, we''re going to see more of these transactions because it''s faster and cheaper and more dependable. As we see the stable coin network build, we expect more stable coins in different jurisdictions and different currencies. We''re going to see on-chain FX. We''re going to rewrite how foreign exchange will be done. We''re going to see on-chain credit. We''re already talking with companies that are rethinking trade financing that they''re able to underwrite those loans on-chain and to be able to back those loans using USDC and be able to pay back their investors in USDC. All of this is happening and I''m most excited about the work on AI. It''s impossible to not talk about AI. And what''s really interesting about AI is that these agents are getting smarter and smarter by the day. They''re going to be negotiating with one another digitally and oftentimes they''ll have to settle whatever they negotiated in value. And it would be really silly for AI agents to send an email to accounts payable to make a bank payment. Most likely, they''ll be doing that settlement on-chain and they''ll be using stablecoins to do so that are traceable with smart contracts in place and different conditions around it. So I''m super excited for what is to come. I''m super excited to be part of the Open Money Summit. Thank you so much. and pistols. Thank you so much for coming to us. Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

We''re really excited to be talking to Matt White and Eric Yip for our first ever consensus in Hong Kong. So I want to start with you because I know that your boss, Julia, just announced the new roadmap for crypto regulation in Hong Kong. And I''m hoping you could expand and tell everybody a little bit more about it. Sure, thank you. I''m very glad to be here. And welcome to Hong Kong, Shiyan and Matthew. We talked about the roadmap, I think, in the main stage. I didn''t get the chance to hear the rest of it, so I just presume that I''m going to carry over. So what will happen is that, I mean, we have been thinking about developing a roadmap for virtual asset development in Hong Kong for a while. And we just have to pick a date. And I don''t think we can pick a better date than today. I went with a very good crowd here, biggest virtual asset conference in Hong Kong this year for sure. And it will be released this afternoon. So I think the concept of the roadmap is that I think if you look back at Hong Kong for the last kind of eight years or so in terms of our virtual asset journey, is that, I mean, we have been very much focused on licensing. I mean, licensing platforms, licensing fund managers, licensing other service providers, et cetera. And I think we actually come to a critical mass. Now, I think as of today, we have 10 virtual asset trading platforms. I think we still can focus on licensing, but I think it''s more important to think about how to make our trading platform works. And I think the question is what is meant by working. And I think from myself bringing up from a traditional finance securities market perspective, I think the one word that we need to think about always is liquidity. How do you bring liquidity to this market? Hence, commercial value, hence ecosystem, et cetera. So liquidity is key. So I think when we designed a roadmap, we actually center around the concept of liquidity. And we are going to cover five pillars. And we kind of play around with the word ASPIRE. A-S-P-I-R-E. I mean, there are six letters. I will explain a bit why it''s six letters, just because it''s cool. So A is talking about assets. How to actually bring the right players, right liquidity providers to the market. Assess. The second is about safeguards. Safeguards is about what kind of compliance requirement as a regulator we can adapt to this market world. So safeguards. The third is about products. What kind of products we can offer to the investors. And the fourth one is about infrastructure. How do we build market-wide infrastructure for surveillance, for transparency, et cetera. And the last one is about, well, RE. Just because I think I need to make a word out of it. It''s relationships. And this is where we are here for. It''s about relationships. And relationships is not just about kind of me and my regulators, but also about, I mean, this kind of whole crowd here. About investors, about service providers, about our peer regulators. I mean, many, many people involved in the industry. Maybe I''ll just stop here. Oh, but I want to hear more. Okay. What comes next? What does it go into effect? What''s actually coming? I think what comes next is that, I mean, it is actually easier to grant a license. It''s actually not that difficult to write a roadmap. Now, the thing is that how do we actually execute the roadmap? And I think the first question people will ask me is that whether there''s a timetable for the roadmap. And the way that I would approach this is that this is a roadmap, not just for one road. I mean, we actually include out of that five pillars, 12 roads, 12 initiatives. And I intentionally didn''t bring in a timetable for each road because I think that requires us and our stakeholders, our regulators, our ecosystem partners, to really think about what kind of transportation you want to use on the road. I mean, if it is something that requires like a high speed train, you have to dig the tunnel, you have to pave the well. That takes some longer time. But this will be a kind of consulted decision. But if it is just really across the street, why don''t we just walk there? We don''t actually need to bring things that is really kind of very sophisticated in order to just walk across the street. So I think out of the 12 initiatives, I mean, we actually held the inaugural consultative panel, which actually comprised all of our licensed virtual asset trading platform management, to really kind of give us an idea, are these the right roads that you want to build? And then we, the next thing we have to think about what kind of transportation we want to build. I think the goal is that in any case, I mean, it won''t be a very, very long journey. I think the market is moving fast. And I think we actually as regulators also need to be fast. So we need to prioritize and find the low hand fruits so that we can let the market kind of see visible results, at least, I mean, across the five pillars in this year. Awesome. Is that enough? Yeah, I think so. Okay, thank you. All right, Matt, what''s happening at the UAE? Well, look, yeah, thank you. Look, first of all, I wanted to just briefly congratulate Eric and the SFC on the roadmap. It''s the first time hearing about it today. But as somebody who, you know, I strongly believe in the potential of the technology. It''s really exciting to hear, you know, major jurisdictions taking this seriously. And I think Hong Kong in particular shares a very similar vision to our leaders in Dubai, which has driven Vara over the last few years. We''re continuing to refine our framework. We have the benefit of some time where we''ve been able to observe market behavior and how participants are operating and what they need. And we have a fairly ambitious regulatory plan for 2025 as well. And a lot of that will happen in Q1. I''ll touch on that here, perhaps. So the reason we''re doing it essentially is strengthen the baseline that we have already, but also to sort of enable and enable market participants like institutions to be able to operate a lot more seamlessly in the market. And so we''ve got three major buckets of what we''re looking at at the moment. Number one are, you know, specific enhancements for institutions, both to be regulated and to be able to operate in the market. So we are about to introduce models for things like off exchange settlement, collateral optimization. We have some derivatives and margin trading frameworks about to about to launch. And also this concept of real world asset tokenization is becoming really, really important. And that''s not just one thing, but it is an area that we''re looking at introducing components of frameworks to as well. So that''s the institutional piece. And they need that infrastructure and they need those products. The next bucket is broadly speaking, again, around DeFi and a DeFi framework. So for me, this is like a, you know, a sort of new frontier of accessible finance, if you like. But it doesn''t, you know, it doesn''t come easily. There are some challenges we need to overcome. So we''re looking at pilots for decentralized exchanges and automated market maker models. We''re taking a look at staking and liquid staking. Staking is already enabled to a certain extent in the market, but liquid staking isn''t. And so we''re looking at how that plays out as well. And the last area of that is around lending and borrowing. So vaults in particular is something that we''re interested in and looking at doing pilots in this year. So that''s number two. The third bucket is a refresh of our sort of issuance framework, reflecting the fact that, you know, the issuance of tokens is becoming more and more important, particularly, as I''ve just mentioned, with real world assets tokenization as well. So we''re very much focused on the activity side of it. So, you know, placement, distribution, secondary trading. And we''re looking at that from a strict disclosure standpoint, but also how do we implement other sort of investor protection measures around that, particularly when it comes to reserves. So they''re the three buckets is a pretty ambitious plan building on what we''ve already got. A lot of that will be introduced in Q1. One of the other really important things that we''re looking to do in 2025 as well is, frankly, deepen collaboration with international regulators. And I''m very grateful for the invite to be able to speak in Hong Kong. And we see this as a jurisdiction that we, you know, we can really work together with. And so that will certainly be on the agenda this year as well, just to make sure we''ve got the right information and knowledge sharing across borders. Awesome. Thank you. Yeah, it''s great. You know, all this talk about regulation and regulatory frameworks and all the good work you guys are doing kind of brings to mind the U.S., which does not really have a crypto regulatory framework. But we have a new president. And with that has come, you know, a change, a big change in tone, if not necessarily in substance yet about how crypto will be regulated in the U.S. And I think that as somebody who covers the U.S. crypto market and U.S. crypto regulation, I have to wonder, you know, if the U.S. really does get its stuff together and U.S. regulators become more friendly to crypto innovation in the U.S., what does that mean for jurisdictions like Hong Kong, like the UAE that have become kind of known for being ahead of the curve? Should I start first? Yeah, sure. Well, I was brought up in the U.S. and I have great admiration of what I think how deep and how wide the U.S. financial industry has been and also innovation. So I think the first thing actually I would do this year as there is already kind of I''m a candidate as I talk about before the chat here is that I would be going to the U.S. I think this year and hopefully I think will be appear in the same conference as Trump to really kind of understand. I mean, his frame of mind. I mean, obviously, U.S. is actually very important in the sense that because they drive a lot of innovation and also because of a lot of commonality with Hong Kong in the sense of financial intermediaries. I think at the end of the day, I think one when we actually draw the roadmap, I think one conviction I think we have to make is that there will be despite of all the geopolitics or whatever people talk about, there will be a certain set of kind of cohesiveness on the regulatory side and also convergence between the traditional finance and the federal asset world. And we already see that kind of getting into the directions and in the sense that with a major financial market like U.S. being coming on board that will only help actually bring that cohesiveness and convergence to happen. And at the same time, which I think in Hong Kong we like is to have a bit of competition so that I think we all push each other kind of stronger and kind of move things faster. And I definitely also look upon to Vara, I think under the leadership of Matthew that I mean, things the topics that he just talked about, to be honest, is like very, very well ahead of us in the sense that I think already when we are talking about staking, you''re already thinking about restaking and liquid staking. So in fact, I think before actually going to US, in our breakfast meeting this morning, I think we can disclose that, is that because I feel kind of pushed by Matthew, I already see him two times in Hong Kong, but I haven''t been to Dubai. And it seems like that actually it will be an occasion where I can visit Matthew and also Dubai to understand also that kind of cross-border collaboration. How I mean between Vara and Hong Kong, SFC, we can actually work closely together. So a lot of this actually is happening because I think the big players are kind of coming on board. So it''s win-win. Nobody loses. Yes. Maybe at the end of the day someone loses, but it''s still actually winning. Okay. Matt, what do you think? Yeah, look. Eric, you''re very kind, by the way. Look, I tend to agree. I think net-net is a positive. Frankly speaking, the industry needs global regulatory clarity. You can''t achieve that without the US. And I''m pretty optimistic about sort of the opportunities for us to be able to collaborate on a regulatory agenda. And also a kind of innovation agenda as well. I''ll keep it short. I''ll keep it short. But, you know, I''m not seeing people gravitating away from the market, sort of, you know, back to the US as such. I think it will be both. In actual fact, I was speaking to a couple of major institutions in the last couple of weeks, and they''re looking to replicate what they''ve got in the US elsewhere, possibly in Dubai. So I really don''t think it''s either or. I think it will be both. I think it''s important to have the organizations that they''ve got there are big enough. But overall, it''s important that we have that global regulatory clarity. And I think that''s what we''ll get. So do you have any advice for your American counterparts as they begin thinking about the stuff that you guys started thinking about a long time ago? I would not presume to know what''s best for the US. What I can tell you is what we''ve learned so far. Two or three really important things. Number one, by far and away, the most important is engagement with industry. Something that we''ve really benefited from in Dubai is that ongoing dialogue with industry participants and, you know, getting some very frank feedback on frameworks and business models and what''s working and what''s not. It also allows us to be a bit more agile as a regulator. So this space moves extremely quickly, as you all know. And for us to be able to, you know, we''ll never be ahead of the curve. But, you know, for us to be as close to that curve as possible, we need that industry dialogue. And so that would be one area. And I think the other two, which I''ll touch on very quickly, and then maybe Eric wants to add, interoperability at the outset is really, really important. I think you can''t do this in isolation. And if you''re trying to do this without looking cross-border or at least considering cross-border risks, I think you''ve got a problem. And then the last one is really that we''ve looked at this strictly as an activity-based piece. We''ve not tried to regulate product. And I think that has served us quite well so far. We haven''t got drawn into the kind of minutiae debates about whether something''s a meme coin or an NFT or whatever it might be. So they''d probably be the three lessons learned from our side. So I think Matthew touched on very tangible, kind of more the sub-dramatic perspective. I would try to touch on more the intangible. I started to learn about this space last year since I joined the commission in May. I have kind of two intangibles that I keep on having in my mind. The one is about humility. Because, I mean, the digital assets is a kind of destructive technology. It''s a destructive kind of asset class. But I think what makes it work, I think, for the last decade or so is that it''s actually filled by very, very brilliant minds and talents. And they are young. They are hungry. They are innovative. And I think they are actually very technically sound. So although, I mean, there are ups and downs here. But I think this, the one conviction I have for this market, why it will work, is because it''s driven by people who are talented. So I think as a regulator, I mean, for us and for America, for VARA, for other jurisdictions, we have to actually listen to the market, understand the market. This is one thing. The other intangible is that, I mean, if you actually look back at the history, history will repeat itself, always. And it is an intrinsically dangerous market. I mean, when, and again, that''s where traditional finance may help because we actually have been through cycles after cycles. And there are players, actually, if you look back for the last 10 years, 10 years is not a big, long time for asset class. And you already see up and down where actually there is financial harms, that investors are being kind of ripped off. There are also companies that fail. So it will happen. And if we actually do not have that diligence, if we do not have that focus in mind, I think at the end of the day, we may actually destroy the marketplace. We should actually survive in the long term. Interesting. Yeah. I like that it''s sort of a respect and curiosity rather than a fear-based approach to regulation. So, all right. We''ll move away from the US. This is a global regulation panel. And something I want to ask you guys about is just big picture, where do you see global crypto regulation going? Because right now, things are still pretty fragmented. I know you''ve both touched on international collaboration. But, you know, what do you think is going to happen? Want me to go? Sure. Look, there is some fragmentation, of course. I think that is pretty natural, given the kind of state of maturity of the technology and regulatory framework. So I don''t think that''s a concern at this point. It''s actually not that dissimilar from traditional finance in some respects, although there are significant areas where coordination around things like AML, you know, exists at the moment. I think, in the end, that''s where it needs to head. And, you know, I suppose there''s a couple of areas like the travel rule where we could quite easily see some harmonization, some clarity for participants about how that works in different jurisdictions. My own view is that I think we''ll be forced into this eventually. The technology, the use cases will just become so pervasive so quickly that, you know, as a global kind of regulatory framework, it will need to exist. You know, stable coins is a really good example of where, you know, I think that will drive the agenda, naturally drive the agenda. So, yeah, it''s fragmented. I think that, you know, naturally over time we will gravitate towards more harmonization in certain areas. Do you think regional harmonization will come before global? Like, will there be a Mika of the Middle East or Asia? You can try first. You can try first. Yeah. Sorry? I mean, Dubai and Hong Kong can try first. We can try. I think that''s a good idea, actually. Look, I don''t know. There''s clearly some divergence in the Middle East. You''ve got the UAE, which has been very clear and progressive around this. You have Saudi and Qatar, which have taken more of a financial infrastructure look at this. And then you have Egypt, who is a complete prohibition on virtual assets. So I think naturally, again, you know, in, say, the next five to ten years, everyone will have some sort of exposure to it. You know, the extent to which they need that exposure. I don''t know. But, again, I think we''ll be forced into that eventually. So maybe I''ll say a few words. Over the last kind of nine months I''ve been with the regulator, I have an observation. Is that, I mean, wherever I attend any regulatory conference, whenever I meet with any regulatory counterpart, be it in the U.S., in Europe, in the U.K., in the region, et cetera. That''s almost even in mainland China. There was no one occasion when this topic, the virtual asset, crypto, has not been talked about. Every time. No exception. Now, I think it comes back to the roadmap. What inspired me to do the roadmap is that I think there has been a lot of interest. There were a lot of kind of dialogue on the IOSCO level, on the regional level, on the bilateral level. All kind of discussion. I think one of my aspirations of kind of doing the roadmap is to put in a framework to think about it. That''s why I mean the five pillars. I mean, it''s a little bit of motherhood and apple pie, but at least I put in a framework. I think what is actually challenging, I think, so far is that we are introducing a lot of topics by many different people. I mean, but we do not have a common kind of framework articulation to talk about it. So it''s kind of our attempt to contribute to probably a more bilateral, more regional, more global dialogue by establishing a framework. And this framework may not be kind of the perfect one, but at least we have something in place. I mean, when we talk about staking, for example, this is a term that is undefined in traditional securities regulator mindset. And by putting that through the mouth of a securities regulator, we''ve got an opportunity when we talk about it, we can kind of define it better. Because at the end of the day, you can''t really go from concept to regulation like overnight. You have to actually go through a thinking process, how to actually break it down into component, how to kind of put the traditional legal compliance framework and kind of govern that. That is going to be a pretty technical process. And hopefully we are getting there in terms of having a common language taxonomy to move things forward. So that''s kind of a bit of an aspiration and inspiration for the roadmap. Yeah, it''s exciting. All right, Matt, you said it first, stablecoins. So I''m going to pick on you. What''s going on with stablecoin regulation in the UAE? And, you know, what would a global stablecoin regulatory framework look like in a perfect world? So I wrote about this quite recently, actually. Stablecoins have been around for a while. Frankly, they will revolutionize the global financial system, in my opinion, eventually. They''re going to disrupt payment networks. You know, you''ve got types of stablecoins that enable you to generate yield and that is challenging risk-free rates as a result. And, you know, you''re expanding access to U.S. dollars to areas that, you know, haven''t really got access to that kind of stability in currency. So, you know, look, it is quite important to regulate that appropriately. The UAE does have frameworks around this already. And taking it quite seriously, albeit cautiously. There are some straightforward projects around fiat-backed stablecoins that will probably come to market first. And there are some more complex projects for stablecoins that are not fiat-backed but also stable in nature. So tokenized money market funds would be a good example. And it''s really important to regulate those properly. I think, you know, there are some significant risks around that. Reserves is a really interesting one. You''d be forgiven for thinking that backing a stablecoin entirely in cash is a good idea. But it''s probably not, given the credit risk that you''re exposing that to in a banking environment. So we''re looking at topics like that in terms of how we would license something like that to, you know, to protect the market as best we can. As for what a global framework would look like, I don''t know. That''s fair. No one knows. I think everyone''s going to have a go at it first. And we''ll probably end up with some sort of FX stablecoin exchange somewhere. But, yeah, I don''t know what a global framework would look like that. So maybe I''ll just pick up from what Matthew just said. I think the one word that I agree the most is that regulated. It has to be regulated. I think my career is actually going through that route. U.S. I think is way and see how that goes. In Hong Kong, definitely we are going through a regulated route. I think in the sense that I think why actually we need stablecoin, for example. I mean, we have Bitcoin, we have other kind of digital currencies. But why do we need stablecoin? Because actually this is one kind of constant in the market which facilitate a lot of the benefit from the blockchain. For example, autonomous settlement and also kind of the fungibility across the system. So that is very fundamental to the whole virtual asset ecosystem. Now, if we talk about edges and the fiat reference stablecoin, for instance, it is in a way fungible. Because at the end of the day, a U.S. dollar, Hong Kong dollar reference stablecoin should be the same. Whether it''s wrapped like this or that. And that''s actually, I think, at the end of the day, what investors, what the ecosystem actually look for is probably security and certain type of safety feature built into it. That''s why where the regulation should come in. So now I think it''s still evolving. But again, with EU, Hong Kong, et cetera, I mean, the stablecoin in Hong Kong is regulated by Hong Kong Monetary Authority. And already the legislation is very, very advanced that we are actually going to put in a regulatory framework for regulating stablecoin. And by following that logic, it means that going, I think, in time, only regulated stablecoin will be allowed. I think at least in this jurisdiction. Now, once we have that in place, I think what would be interesting to see is not just the stablecoin per se, and how actually stablecoin can interact with the rest of the regulated ecosystem. And I think that''s where SFC come into place. Because it actually will operate kind of the investment product landscape, the trading platform landscape. And I think we need to work with a fellow regulator, Hong Kong MA, to create use cases to make the stablecoin kind of use and have fair proposition in the virtual asset trading perspective. So I think that''s kind of where we are going in Hong Kong. I was going to ask you guys about memecoins, the opposite of stablecoins, but I think you''re saved by the bell. So, oh, yeah. But something I do want to ask you about. Yeah, unless you want to take 10 seconds, how do we regulate memecoins? Well, I don''t know. Yeah, well, no one does. So, all right, I guess we''ll close with this. If we''re on the same stage in a year, things move really fast in crypto. What will we be talking about then? I think we were talking about, I mean, if I''m on the stage, I think people will hold me accountable. I mean, despite, I mean, I''m saying there''s no timetable. Hold me accountable for how much progress I''ve made on the roadmap. So I think that''s something I have in mind as my kind of KPIs here. Yeah, I think we''ll see some greater policy clarity, hopefully some strong relationships between jurisdictions. Probably some more non-financial use cases. We talk a lot about financial use cases here, but stuff like AI and crypto intersections or decentralized research and development. I think we''ll probably see a bit more of that. We''re starting to see that creeping up at the moment. So I suspect we''ll be talking about those things. That sounds interesting. So you guys all have to come back in a year so we can talk about that. All right. Well, thank you guys so much for being here and thank you guys for listening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Great. Yeah.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.169', NULL, 'https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-global-regulation-panel-35', '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');
INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('53f2c28dde', 'Protocol Village: BNB', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hi, this is Sara from BMHN. Thank you for having me today. I''m the head of BMHN BD team. I''m really honored to be invited here today to introduce a bit about BMHN, what we are doing, what is our plan this year and next year, and so what is our metrics and focus in terms of devs, in terms of tech features in the coming years. So today I will spend around 40 minutes together with you guys to introduce a bit more about what is BMHN and what is our focus and priorities right now. So what is our mission? BMHN''s mission is to really onboard the next billions of users to WebStrike. By doing so, we''re really working closely with end users and developers to offer them whatever it is, is the tip, development tools, infras, or different kinds of DApps, including DeFi, AI, gaming, DeSol, DeScience, et cetera, to onboard users in a seamless institution''s way and also lower down the user''s barriers as much as possible as we can do. So by having these missions, we have done a lot in the past five years. I think everybody remember if you joined this industry back to five years ago, there is a DeFi summer back to 2020. At that time, BMHN got a really big hype. There''s a lot of people farming on BMHN DeFi protocol like Pancake, Throw Up, OneNest, and there''s also a lot of really interesting gaming projects that''s building there. So this year, we''re doing something new. I will introduce it later. But we''re keeping building and keeping growing to achieve our mission and our visions. So first of all, I wanted to start with some really, really interesting metrics on BMHN. I think everybody knows that we have three really important tech stocks, which is one is BMHN Smart Chain, which is the layer one protocol. It is also an EVM compatible chain, which means if you have solid contract on Ethereum or any other EVM chains, you can easily migrate to BMHN Smart Chain. And in terms of the metrics on BMHN Smart Chain, which has been successfully operated for over five years, some important data I wanted to highlight. One is about liquidity. Right now, BMHN Smart Chain is one of the top five TVL chains compared with all other layer one layer two protocols. So there is over 7.6 billion TVL assets that''s been already stacked on BMHN Smart Chains. And also we have another over 6 billion stablecoins circulated there. Those are USDT, USDC, FDUSD, and a lot of other yield-bearing stablecoins that''s circulated on BMHN chains. So if you are in assets issue, you wanted to really launch your assets and get your assets to a lot of liquidity supported there, BMHN Smart Chain will be the ideal place for you to choose to launch your assets. So any kind of asset, right? For example, meme coins, UT tokens, or even RWA assets, design tokens, et cetera. So for BMHN Smart Chain, we really want it to be the DeFi hub for any kind of assets and any kind of trading experiences or token launching platforms. Besides that, we are also one of really, really cheaper chains in terms of compared with all other layer one protocols. So the TPS on BSC is around like 5K, and we are going to increase that TPS this year a lot. And also the gas fee on BSC is now to 0.03 US-style pet transactions. So that''s already lower enough compared with other layer one protocols. So if you wanted to have secure and also have liquidity as I mentioned, you do really consider BMHN Smart Chain. But besides that, we also have a big user base. I think a lot of devs are choosing BMHN. One of the major reasons is because we have a large user base. On BMHN Smart Chain, we have over 500 million unique address, which means if you are really developing a solution that is playable for users, that is the user base you''re going to face up with. Can you imagine how many users you''re going to have once you launch something really useful, helpful, or even funny on BMHN? But besides BMHN Smart Chain, last year, or it''s actually two years ago, 2023, September, we launched in another solution called OP-BNB, which is the OP-Rollup building on top of BMHN Smart Chain. This is a layer two-slow solution that in the BMHN infrastructure. So this one, we''re dedicated ability for any type of high-frequency devs. For example, gaming, AI, diesel, designs, et cetera. So this year, we have saw that a lot of devs that is really requiring high-frequency interactions on chain have really migrated from BMHN Smart Chain to OP-BNB, or from other layer two to OP-BNB, just because the TPS here on OP-BNB is up to 5K to 10K, and the gas fee is now to 0.0001 US dollar per transactions. And also, OP-BNB has been also supported by a lot of, like, sexes. So if you have assets, for example, Binance or other sexes, you can easily withdraw your assets directly to OP-BNB. So you don''t need to have really using a decentralized bridge. You can just use the sex to be the bridge for your assets to micro-gate or to bridge to OP-BNB. That will be also easier, especially for Web2 users, to onboard them to this new chain. Actually, besides that, right, here is an overall more comprehensive one picture about what BNB ecosystem. So except BNB chain, which is including BSA and OP-BNB, as I mentioned, we also have a really important tech stock, which is BNB Greenfield. So this is also a really important tech stock we just launched, main, late, two years ago, back to 2023. It is a decentralized storage protocol dedicated for hot data, popular data, regular use data, instead of for cold data. So we think this is really critical in for us in this ecosystem, especially for any kind of data related or AI related applications. So there is a seamless bridges between Greenfield, Waze, OP-BNB, or BSC. So if you do want to make sure your data has been decentralized stored in a secure way, but also you want to have permission control over your data, then Greenfield will be the ideal solutions that''s been there. So you can have your smart contract to manage the permission of your data on BSC or OP-BNB, and you store your data on Greenfield in a very, very cheap way. So Greenfield launched BNB chain for less than two years, but there''s already a lot of AI projects or data or even DID project has already started to put their data on Greenfield. So you can track those informations on our website or database, so there''s a lot of data already there. But besides that, right, we also have run really interesting initiative that''s been started to dedicate it to secure or protect our end users and our dApps, which is AvengerDAO. We all know that during DeFi summers, there is a lot of rock pools and there''s a lot of risk for end users. If you wanted to really farm your tokens into some like staking pools, you always worried about if there''s any potential risk you''re going to face up with. So that''s why we started AvengerDAO together with a lot of security auditing firm in this space. So if we''re working with those top ones, then they will do automatic risk screen for the project that''s been developed or have smart control on BNB chains. So if there is any risk, we will put a red flag onto the projects on our website. So every people will be aware that this project will have potential risk. So when you want to really do interaction with those projects, you need to be really careful. So that''s an initiative that we are doing and we are putting a lot of effort into to just take care of our rate and the users'' wells and their assets. So that''s an asset concept of a one BNB. To be the technically ready is not good enough, actually. We still saw that there''s a lot of barriers or handlers to really onboard more users into BNB chain ecosystem or into WebStory spaces. For example, if you are a retailer, you need to have BNB tokens in your wallet to be the gas fee when you want to transfer your assets to your friends or to interact with any kind of devs on BNB chains. For example, if you are really doing farming or doing trading on different protocols, even on different chains, there is different protocols or a website you need to go through. For example, you need to use bridge. You need to use many protocols and taxes on different platforms and different blockchains. So we think there''s a lot of things we can do in terms of these user barriers to really onboard them seamlessly. So one thing we have started last year is to giving a gas-less solution to our user by integrating with the top CEX, with the top bullets, and any kind of DeFi or even payment gateways. So we introduced a solution called MegaFuel, developed by NodeRail and sponsored by BNB chain foundation. And we integrated it with wallets, for example, like Ocas wallet, Binance website wallet, Trust wallet, Bigger wallet, those top ones that you can think of. And also most of the top liquidity sectors also integrated with this solution. So if you have USDT, USDC, or FDUSD on BMC on the wallet or on the SEC I just mentioned, you can simply withdraw or transfer your stable coins to the others without having the BME tokens in your wallets. And also we are working with some of the really interesting protocols to enable users to donate money through Twitter or even in the future through Instagram or other kinds of social medias. And we also saw that some community members or builders and even VCs that they are utilizing this unique features to donate money to PhDs, to researchers, to help them and to incentivize them and even to teach them how to use wallet. Some of them even the first time they try Trust wallet and they don''t need to buy any BNB tokens in their wallet to transfer a stable coin. They think, oh, this is really, you know, excited. They can''t imagine that will happen. So that''s a way how we educate the people they have never tried blockchain, they have never tried wallet before. This initiative we''ll keep doing this year and we will plan to enable megafield to support any kind of assets. Not just stablecoin, but also all coins, whatever the coin you have on the BNB chain, you can consider to get it supported on megafield and you can sponsor the gas for the users on your own. So that''s the thing that we have done, starting from last year, which is quite important. And we wanted to promote this stablecoin transfer and payment initiative on top of BNB chain. Besides that, we''re also working really, really hard to protect our users and to give our users more user-friendly trading experiences. That''s why we enabled MEV protection services by working with a lot of validators, wallets, and DeFi protocol. So right now, if you are using trust wallets or any other top-weighted to do the trade, any kind of that, for example, on PankerSwap, you can use the MEV protection solutions directly or other default solutions on BNB chains, which will protect your transactions. And we are keep optimizing the solutions together with our validators and our wallet solution providers. And even recently, we have put out a public voting through Snapshot to asking the comments and opinions from the users and the communities. And I think a majority of them agree that if there is any bad thing that has been done in terms of MEV by the validators or even the key players in the BNB chain ecosystem, we''re going to punish them. So that''s another thing we are trying very hard to make the trading experiences on BNB chain more friendly to end builders and to protect our users'' assets. We keep doing these things together with our builders this year. Actually, we''re also planning to onboard a smart wallet solution together with our wallet providers, which means once there''s a smart wallet solution, users even don''t really need to understand private key, public keys, how to manage your private keys, how to remember those data. You don''t need to understand that. You will have a really, really simple way just ask how you do traders, how you log into your Google account by using the smart wallet solutions on BNB chain. That is also one of the very, very important tech features that we are planning to do this year. So by having all those different initiatives or technical features to be ready here, our goal is to support our, you know, you know, tenant developers and entrepreneurs to really provide the solutions that is workable and usable for end user. Whatever it is, just a trader, a meme coin fence, or it is a real retailer user that is using this double coin to transfer over different countries and regions. So we wanted to build this together with all our ecosystem builders. But besides that, right, we have some focus this year. One important focus I wanted to highlight is AI related solutions. We all know that AI is a really important technology that''s going to increase productivity in the futures. And blockchain is the way that we really changing how people interact with each other, how we monetize each other, and how the system can incentivize the contributors in the future. So that''s two really, really unique and interesting technologies in the future. And we do think there''s a unique combination between each other. For example, right now, the AI technology has been controlled by the top AI companies. And your data, and in the future, maybe your own AI girlfriend or AI boyfriend will be controlled by those big companies. But you don''t want it to happen, right? So we really need to have blockchain technologies to really governance AI technology development in the future. And there''s a lot of other things we can think of. For example, the people is talking about AI agent recently. Why AI agents should combine with blockchain technologies? Because if you think AI agent can be a digital person in the future, and everybody can have different digital persons by your own, and you can tailor-made it. And how AI agent person can really help you in your daily life. There is a really important function you should have, which is really interacting with your assets. And they can use smart contract to monetize the programmability of smart contract to manage your assets, or to do their daily job per your own request. So that''s why digital assets and AI agent combined can have a really magical power to really enable a smart economy in the future. So imagine you have assets on the blockchain. Maybe it''s USDT, it''s Cybercoin, or it''s ULB and Cybercoin. And then you want to invest in different kinds of assets. It can be a stock. It can be a digital gold. It can be a design for a close. You want to sponsor some like PHE, et cetera, things. How you can do it right now? You can only do it in different bank system and different centralized finance platforms. But in the future, by having AI agent plus those digital assets on the chain, you can do it in one single way. Just by just interacting with this AI agent that is dedicated to do investment solutions for you. So just by having one AI agent, you can invest in different types of assets. And even you can have different types of DeFi logo by building on top of it. That''s just one single case. In the future, you can also do a lot of things by utilizing AI agent plus digital assets in your daily life. That will be really exciting for every people. And that will really improve the efficiency of the whole society. So that''s why we''re pushing very hard to be the AI first chain this year for BNB chains. So here is an AI landscape that we prepared. There''s already over 16 AI related projects building on top of BNB chains. This is just a start. There''s going to be a lot more AI projects that''s going to launch on BNB chain mainnet. Those projects can be AI plus data labeling projects, can be AI agent projects. It also can be AI tech info related. Like they are building an AI infrastructure that can easily onboard different developers to build any kind of AI projects on top of BNB chain and tokenize it. And interact with DeFi protocols on BNB chains. And also a lot of other, for example, decentralized computing and AI governance, etc. So we talk to a lot of like really talented AI developers in this space every day. And we are really excited about what they''re going to build in their futures by combining these two technologies together. And to support them, as I mentioned, we have BNB screen Greenfield here as a really important layer. So if you are doing AI data labeling projects, you can easily store your data onto BNB Greenfield. This year we''ve gone on to add privacy protection functions onto Greenfield as well. So you don''t need to worry about your data''s privacy if you really store that data on the decentralized storage in the futures. And also if you are just doing the AI agent, you want to have agent memory functions for your products. Then you can also store the agent related data, metadata onto Greenfield to enable the memory functions there. So Greenfield will be a really important layer here to make us to be the layers or to the infra that is dedicated for AI dApps compared with all other. layer one or layer two protocols. So they don''t have that functions there. And also we are building a lot of interesting AI agent solutions or tools. For example, AI blockchain plugins by aggregating different AI blockchain solutions into AI developer tools. For example, a lot of people launching the AI assets on chain and then we integrate with those launchpad or Dexas that rally. So if you are building the AI products on their platform, then there''s going to be a plug-in solutions which can easily get your assets to be launched on BNB chain or traded on BNB chains. And also we work in a more comprehensive multi-agent infrastructures which will enable different agents in a BNB chain ecosystem can communicate and even work with each other. So we work in a lot of different ways to do different types of data. So we work in a lot of different types of data, which means you have one agent to do one task A, you have agent to do task B, and then you can combine those together to finalize, to really realize a really complicated task or request for your users or for your customers. And also we are trying to work with the top AI companies to more incentivize some independent AI developers to open source their AI solutions or whatever code they have on GitHub to benefit the future AI developers together with us. So that''s the goal and that''s what we have to do in our BNB chain ecosystem. And as I mentioned, by having the one BNB concept, we are a layer that is offering the cheap gas fee, high throughput, and comprehensive technology solutions, and a lot of like AI related tools that is ready for any types of assets or AI products to building on top of. And recently we are talking with some of the really, really interesting researchers in the universities in terms of some really advanced AI research. So in the future, we will support more AI research related protocols under these science sectors. We may help them to fund more money through blockchain or through crypto industries and to support them to do more advanced research in AI aspect. So, and also we know the developers is one of the most important communities or most important type of person we need to target. That is the person that is really using our technologies and expanding it to the end users. So we wanted to really build a layer that is very friendly for different types of developers. At the beginning, I have mentioned we are EVM compatible layers, which means if you are a solid-t contract, smart contract coder, it will be easy for you to write any kind of contract, smart contract on BNB chains. But besides that, we are developing a lot of like streamlined SDKs and APIs to enable the more easier way to develop there. And also we are working with different infra builders, including AI, including data platforms, including validators, any kind of like developer tools like Acme, and the Fiat on-or-ramp solution providers, and a lot like DeFi infras like Dexas, Landings. All of them are really open to support different types of like developers. And we have a kickstart program that is combining all those relevant services provider like auditing, security auditing, data provider, etc. And getting them to have a discounted service that is offered dedicated to BNB chain ecosystem builders, or even giving them some free credit to our developers. So if you are building there, at least the infra is quite ready, and even you are getting a really cheap, you know, services there offered by our partners. And also we are building an open source development framework. As I mentioned, right, especially for AI, we are trying to incentivize those top AI developers to open source their code, and to contribute their code to the whole ecosystem, and build more advanced AI solutions on top of our BNB chain ecosystem. And also BNB chain is doing an AI code copilator, which is, as I mentioned, kind of like aggregators for different types of the AI solutions or tools building there that''s going to be used for any type of AI related builders. So, but besides the tool that we have developed there that is ready for use for our developers, there is also a lot of incentive and programs that we have done and we will keep going doing in the coming years. Those incentives can be divided into two parts. One is money related, another one is other type of support. I think everybody will care about what is the monetization solution or support or incentive you have, you know, the BNB chain ecosystem. So I will spend a bit more time on this part. So actually we have different type of incentive, money incentivized approaches to support our developers. One is Hackersong. Actually, this week we just started the AI Hackersong together with some other AI project that''s the sponsor for the Hackersong. So every year we will have like two, three to four online Hackersongs and a few offline Hackersong. This year at April, we will have another Hackersong maybe in Hong Kong as well. So we encourage any types of builders to attend our Hackersong. And the winner of our Hackersong may be able to directly connect you to the NBB incubation program that we have together with Easy Labs. Or they can just attend our BIA event, which is incubation alliance together with those top VCs. So Hackersong is a way that we find and we support our builders. And there''s already some really interesting project that''s been running out of the Hackersong before us. So this year, as I mentioned, AI Hackersong just started right now. So you can feel free to apply our Hackersong online and submit your code. And maybe we can see each other in the future during the Hackersong demo days. But besides that, as I mentioned, there''s another two really important initiatives. One is BIA. What is BIA? It is a BNB chain incubation alliance that we do together with top VCs, as I mentioned, including Easy Labs, Dragonfly, Pantera, Spartan, Forestide Winchairs, etc. So this year, BIA is going to be bigger than last year. Last year, we had six rounds of BIA in different events. And finally, there is a large project has been selected through BIA and they''re already being accepted into MVB programs with Easy Labs. And some of them even being invested by Easy Lab in the end. I won''t say the name because they didn''t disclose it yet, but that''s a way how we support projects. But this year, we''re going to make BIA even bigger by partnering with a lot other ventures, especially some ventures that have committed some amountings for the top winners for BIA events. For example, East Denver next week, we''re going to have 10 projects doing pitching there. And we already got commitment from at least three ventures, I mean three outside ventures, except Easy Lab to funding the top winners or to directly accept them to their incubation programs. So BIA is a really important approach that we''re using to support and monetizing our developers. This year at April in Hong Kong, we will also do another round of BIA. So if you have a project or you are a VC, you want to collaborate with us on BIA event, feel free to reach out to me or Walter who is sitting there. And then we can talk about more on how we can work together on BIA this year, which is going to be very interesting. And also, MVB program, just as I mentioned, right, that''s a very, very long-term program that we had with Easy Lab before. And using that program, we have already invested a lot, really interesting projects, and get them building on top of BNCHNs. So MVB session 9 has just ended like three weeks ago. Right now we are doing the review into the, you know, hundreds and thousands of applications. And every round we will select around 10 to 15 projects to be admitted to MVB program. And finally, there''s going to be few projects selected to be invested by Easy Labs based on their on-chain metrics of BNB chain or other things like mind share of the project and the product features. So I think a lot of people wanted to know what is the criteria for your MVB programs when you''re selecting different project or developer to support. Actually, it''s a comprehensive consideration. It depends on what product you are building, what is the unique feature you are having by utilizing blockchain technologies. What is your target users? What is the team background? And how you''re going to make it to go to market? And most importantly is what is the biggest potential contribution you''re going to have on BNB chain in terms of their product features, in terms of the out-chain metrics like TVO, like DAU, like trading volume, etc. things. So if you wanted to apply MVB next round, which may happen like three months ago, then you need to really consider this metrics when you''re preparing your product or your presentations. That is about MVB. But besides that, we also have a lot of incentive programs. If you are a meme trader, you may know this week we just announced a 4.4 million incentive programs for meme coins. So if you are a top meme coins on BNB chains that''s been traded there in terms of the market cap, in terms of the holders of the meme coins, and also maybe the trading volume, etc. And then you will get direct LP support from us. So we will use half of the money to buy your token and half of money as BNB and add it as LP directly into your assets on Pancake. That can be something really interesting. And we already thought that there''s a lot of assets issuer that is launching their token on BNB chain and get their communities or users to trade on BNB chains. That''s one thing we are doing right now. And there''s going to be another really interesting thing we will start soon, which is AI agent asset trading competitions. We''re working together with data platforms. So right now on BNB chain, there is at least five different AI launch pads that''s majorly running on top of BNB chains. So if you want it to be a tailor-made AI agents on BNB chain and launch the assets on BNB chain, you can do it right now because you can attend the AI agent assets trading competitions there. And the winner can also get some monetization incentivized from the program. And we are working with those top AI agent platforms as well. So maybe they will also give in some incentivize for the builder that is really using their AI infra to build different type of AI agents on BNB chains. And also we have builder grant program that is dedicated for especially infra builders or tool builders, like data platforms or developer tools. So if you are really building some unique developer tool that can solve our issues right now, reach out to me. We can talk about your ideas. And our builder grant review process will take around like one to two months to finally get an answer to you whether your grant proposal being accepted or not. Last year we have doing grant support for a lot of projects or infra that is building on top of OPBNB. And we have released a grant wish list on our GitHub. So you can reach, you can check the wish list on the GitHub to see what direction we are really pushing hard ways. And we are really waiting to using builder grants to support ways. And also we have DAU incentive program, TVO incentive program, a lot of others. And we will tailor make some really interesting program this year as well according to users'' request. So let us know what you want, what kind of support you are expecting from BNB chain foundation. We can think of it. We can talk. We can even tailor make it for use. That is about monetization incentive that we have in hand that is supporting projects. But besides that, the general support we have is also important. For example, marketing support, technology support, and community support. What''s interesting is we''re even helping some of our projects to connect with the top KOL in our BNB chain ecosystem. So some projects, they just start from zero. They don''t know where they can find the KOL that they can support their product functions on BNB chain. And what we do is we connect them and they can talk with each other what they wanted to do each other. And if there''s any deal that they can reach with each other. So if you don''t have KOLs, maybe even you are just Web 2 before. You don''t know people working in this space. We are the bridges here for you to connect with them. We even connect you with centralized exchange, with wallet solution providers, with a lot of VCs or big KOLs in this space. Only if you are building something really contributing to our ecosystem and really, really interesting for users and for other developers. So besides that, I think everybody, some of you guys already follow BNB chain traders. So there is a huge amount of followers of our social media. So any kind of marketing support will also be a big beneficiary to our developers and to our ecosystem builders. So once you are a project that''s launching on Main8 and we have done a tech DD, we will be happy to support you with general marketing support. Like for example, retweet your official launch on BNB chain, AMM, online, online events, different type of marketing programs, whatever it is. So there''s different things we can do in terms of promotions. So we are always very open and friendly to our projects and to our developers and users. We''ll just be there and we want to reach out to you if you have any interesting idea. And we even wanted to combine or connecting you with other builders in our ecosystem and to encourage you guys to discuss with each other and find some really new ideas or programs or dApps. So that is how we incentivize and how we support BNB chain ecosystem. This year, we are focusing on how to onboard more AI developers on BNB chains. But besides that, we are also pushing hard on stablecoin, as I mentioned, and also RWA and designs. So if you are doing any type of project, especially regarding AI, RWA, stablecoin, designs, reach out to us. We wanted to talk to you. For sure, if you are just a meme coin, traders or even launchers, you are a liquidity provider, can also reach out to us, talk to us. We are happy to talk about your special culture and your communities and how to build that community together with BNB chain ecosystem. So here are the contact ways how you can get connected with us. If you want to talk more with us about your project or your ideas, I mentioned, Sarah and Walter are there. So you can reach out to us and talk about more later today. Thank you all. That''s all from my side. Really, thank you and honor to be there today. But this is just a start. We wanted to innovate together with all of you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Just, coming to us. Thank you.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.197', NULL, 'https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-welcome-remarks-134', '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');

So for those of you guys who are not familiar with the name Weeks, we actually established in 2018 and we have been building this brand and product ever since. In 2019, we were actually invested by a few top investment firms in Singapore and we raised 100 million. And just within two years, we were actually able to grow our platform all the way from zero to 2 billion daily trading volume. In 2022, we actually reached 500,000 daily users. And in 2022 as well, we managed to sign Jackie Wu, one of the leading entertainers in the Hong Kong industry, as our global brand ambassador. And he really helped us elevate our brand across Asia. And in 2023, we managed to grow our user base to over 2 million users globally. We obtained the SVG and FSA license so that we were actually able to operate in a lot more regions, which is why right now we are available technically worldwide in over 200 countries and regions. And in 2023 as well, we managed to raise another round of 100 million investment from a very impressive company in South Korea. One of the biggest marketing agency, right? So the FSN group. So for those of you guys who are from South Korea, you guys should know them. Yep. And in 2024, last year actually, I think it was one of our best year, full of achievements. I''m very proud to say that we are one of the fastest growing exchange last year. We managed to grow from 2 million to 6 million users globally. And we managed to reach a daily trading volume of 5 billion as well. And we were able to do this because, you know, we have a very unique selling point. We have one of the most altcoin pairs, right? 1,700 plus futures and spot trading pairs to provide, you know, a vast variety of trading options for all of users. And this year, we are very confident to say that we will continue to be one of the fastest growing exchange. And we have a lot of things planned ahead, right? We expanded our team from 250 to over 500 today just to match our growth and what we are experiencing right now. And we are also going to launch a very beautiful office in Dubai in two months. So for those of you guys who are going to head to token249 in Dubai later this year, feel free to connect with us in the conference, but also visit our office in Dubai. Yep. So a little bit about Wix. Like I said just now, we were founded in 2018. And today we managed to achieve more than 5 billion daily trading volume and more than 6 million users across the globe. And we have established 1,000 Bitcoin as a protection fund to ensure that, you know, all our users and security is like our top priority. Right? And we also basically cover most of the regions in the world, especially the upcoming regions like South Africa, African, and even the Russian community. Okay. So in last year, we managed to... Our highest ranking on CoinMarketCap was actually fifth. So right below OKEx BigGet. So I think that is one of the greatest achievements we have achieved up to today. And I definitely do hope and see this trend to continue moving forward. So the one and only Wix. Right? So why is Wix so unique? We have actually asked a lot of our partners and users this question. And we received multiple feedbacks about how we provide one of the most trading pairs across all trading platforms right now. So I''m confident to say that if you can''t find a pair that you want to trade on Wix, you technically cannot find it anywhere else at any other central exchanges. Yep. So like I mentioned just now, 1,700 plus spot and futures pairs. So 1,000 spot, 700 plus futures. Right? Not only the quantity side of things. Right? We are really focused on providing you guys with the most value with listing. Which is why we list more than 100 different projects monthly. Okay? When we talk about projects and stuff, recently memes have been going off the charts. Right? And when it comes to meme trading, we know how important it is to provide our users an early access towards these tokens. Just a very good example. Trump token that happened a few weeks ago. So Wix was one of the earliest exchanges to list the Trump token. I think at about $5. So you were able to actually purchase Trump at $5 on Wix. But I''m not sure if you guys observed the market at that time. A lot of exchanges actually came in a lot later. And that really lose the edge for their users and our users as well. Because, you know, $5 and $8, that''s easily like 5x difference when it goes all the way up to $40. Right? So I think another edge that I really appreciate our team doing is providing the most hot tokens available to our users in this industry today. Okay, the next thing, top level liquidity. Right? When it comes to trading, liquidity is honestly one of the highest priority for a lot of users. You want to get in and out of your trade instantly. Right? So we have over 800 plus deep liquidity futures. And we are actually top 5 among all exchanges in terms of liquidity. But another very interesting fact. Right? A research done by CoinMarketCap recently. If we only look at Bitcoin and Ethereum, we are actually top 3 among all exchanges. So we are very proud to say that we are one of the leading platforms when it comes to altcoin trading, as well as any crypto trading, to be honest, because of the liquidity that we provide. Yeah. Next up, we recently just launched this new feature. Two months ago, our highest liquid leverage was 200x. But we decided to launch 300x last month. And last week, we actually launched 400x because we observed the data from our users. Right? A lot of our users nowadays actually prefer higher leverage. Right? It is... I personally would never recommend anyone to go above 50x. But more than 30% of our users actually trade more than 200x leverage. Right? And it is very obvious from the market trend right now, from the memes and stuff, people actually want to put less capital in and like go for the higher upside. Right? So we think that this 400x leverage is going to open up a lot of different opportunities for everyone across the globe, even those with less capital. Yeah. And I think this is honestly a very good feature that we will continue to hopefully improve on in the future. And another very important point that I want to point out today is we are offering 0% maker free for all spot and futures pairs. Right? So what we are trying to do right now is trying to minimize the cost for our traders to take trades so that they can maximize their profits. Alright. Like I mentioned just now, for any exchanges out there, I think security should be our top priorities. And then right now, Wix is taking this area very seriously. Right? Last year, we established a 1000 BTC Bitcoin protection fund to ensure that all our users'' funds are secure and safe on our platform. Right? We have consistently managed to have more than 100% reserve ratio for the last two years. Right? And we have also built a very top tier risk control system. Not just the system, to be honest. What I''m more proud of is the people behind the system. We managed to capture some of the top names in the industry from tier 1 exchanges like Binance, OKEx, Bybit, to head over two weeks and really build this top level system that we really strive to provide our users. Alright. Moving into the next topic that I think a lot of you guys here will be more interested in is we recently launched our WXT token, which is a native platform token for weeks. And I think the achievement that we achieved over the last six months is definitely a benchmark for every centralized exchange trying to launch a token right now. Right? So from launch last year to a few months ago, WXT gained a total of 384%. I think that is the highest among all the top exchanges token since launch. And we are very happy that we are able to achieve this from our supporters, like our partners, users, as well as some institutional investors. So like I mentioned just now, a record breaking journey. Right? Over 284% since launch. And I think a lot of the partners here today actually benefited from the launch as well. So WXT tokenomics. Right? Our total supply is 40%. But last month, we actually burned 40... Our token supply is 10 billion, my bad. And then we actually burned 40% last month. So right now it''s at 6 billion. It''s about 200 million market cap. So our futures plans for WXT is very straightforward. We are trying to replicate the success of other centralized exchange token. So we will be burning WXT every single quarter. We will take 20% of our company''s revenue, profits, and we will burn it to reduce the supply and enhance the token value. Okay. So what can you do with WXT? Right? So as a user, you can basically get a substantial trading fee discount on our platform. We offer up to 70% trading fee discounts just by holding WXT. And, you know, as an affiliate, if you guys are partnered with us, holding WXT will also give you guys a higher profit share. And I think one of the most attractive things for me and for most of my users are the airdrops and, you know, a platform that we call relaunch. Relaunch is essentially... Yep. Relaunch is essentially a platform, a launch pool, where we allow our users to just buy, commit, and claim airdrops. Right? So all you have to do is just buy WXT, commit to projects that you guys like on the relaunch platform, and then you guys will get millions of airdrops every single month. Talking about airdrops, we actually have a very exciting event right now. Okay. So right now we are hosting a 1 million USDT worth of WXT airdrop. So for any of you guys that are holding WXT, you guys can actually head to the platform, sign up to the event, and then you can basically get free airdrops. I think it''s one of the biggest event this year that we are hosting for all WXT holders. And this is really to thank everyone who supported us throughout the years. Another edge that we have that, you know, really powered our growth is, you know, the easy registration that we have. Right? It''s very frictionless. You can basically get started with your crypto journey within a minute on WXT. Right? All you need is an email. So yeah, it''s honestly one of the most user friendly platform out there that you guys can just sign up instantly and get started with trading. Okay. So some plans that we have this year for WXT, WXT will be very active in conferences like ConsenSys. Right? So I''m here right now in Hong Kong, presenting this to you guys. And in April, we''ll be in Moscow as well. I mean, we all know that Russia is an emerging market. And then WXT really, we are trying to build a presence globally. And one of the most important events this year is Token 2049 in Dubai. Right? Not just because the event is going to be pretty substantial, but because we''ll be launching our Dubai office as well. So I would love, you know, for all of you guys to come over to our office, take a visit and I''m pretty sure you guys will like it. It''s a very nice area. So WXT 2025 promise, right? It''s very straightforward. We want to make sure we provide the best experience for all of our users, including the institutional and VIP users as well. So something that we realized recently is a lot of the Web 2, old money, you know, maybe because of the current traditional market condition. A lot of them are moving into the Web 3 space right now. And a lot of our users are actually kind of, we label them as high net worth. So we definitely want to provide a better service for this group of people. Right? Because we know that a lot of value are coming into the Web 3 space from them. And boosting, the next thing is boosting community engagement. Just like any project, we think that community is the main driver. Right? I think Andy will definitely agree with this, especially when it comes to meme and stuff. We want to build this community, a very strong community here at Wix, because, you know, it will definitely help us expand into a lot more areas and a lot more partnerships as well. And the last thing is global expansion and compliance. Right? So in 2025, one of our top priorities among across all departments is compliance. Right? We want to be as compliant as possible. And we want to seek regulatory approval, especially in certain regions. So this is something that we will invest a lot in moving forward. All right. I want to take this opportunity to really thank my team, as well as all of our partners here today. You know, if you guys are watching this as well. So 2024 has definitely been a very remarkable journey for us. Fastest growing and I''m really happy and proud to say that we have achieved tremendous results. So last year, great year. This year, I think it will be a better year. So for all partners, stay tuned and I hope you guys enjoy this journey with us. Yeah, some of the K-R reviews, I think some of them are actually here. I think Crypto Banter is here right now. I''m not sure if he''s here, but I think they have some booth going on. So like we are currently partnered with some of the top names in the space. So like I''m pretty sure some of you guys know Cloud the Moon, Shadow Sniper from Crypto Banter and Crypto Lifer. So they are all our top partners and we are very proud to say that we have established a very good relationship and partnership with them. And we see this going very slowly moving forward as well. All right. Cool. That''s all that I want to share. regarding WIGs. So I''m very honored to have Andy here today. I mean, for those of you guys, I mean, we are in Hong Kong. I''m pretty sure everyone knows Andy. But for those of you guys who are not that familiar, he''s a very successful investor as well as an author. Yeah. So thank you, Andy, for joining me here today. Yeah, no problem, man, bro. So let''s have a chat. You know what? I know we hear a lot of things that is going on with WIGs, you know, and we had a lot of different chats on how community is going to build, right? Around this space right now. Do you think building communities is really that tough? Or what secret recipe do you have? No. Like I told Andy just now as well, I think building community is a lot tougher than a lot of you guys think, especially comparing now to 2018 when a huge influx of users are coming into the Web3 space without much knowledge. But right now, a lot of the users are actually a lot more educated. I mean, thanks to all the information that we provide. So users are actually smarter in a way. So to really build a strong community, you need to provide enough value for them. It''s not just like, you know, you have some airdrops, everybody just come to my community and then, you know, they stay with you. We don''t need this kind of community. We want communities that stay with you because of who you are, either who you are or what you provide for them long term. True. Yeah. I mean, before maybe you ask me some question as well. Yeah. I just want to chip in on that because I think now that the users are more sophisticated. Yeah. Right? They want to know what you can provide from an exchange, right? And what the project is doing with the exchange. Because if you know there''s a lot of these rumors going on, you know, so-and-so project has a lot of insider, right? So-and-so exchange is more favorable, maybe more favored to certain projects, you know, and that makes the whole environment, you know, pretty tough for community building, you know, because at one side they love the incentive, but at the same time they would think that, wow, you know, is this project going to be backed by the exchange wholly? You know, so it''s not easy to really build effectively, right? And we had a conversation just now. We mentioned it is actually more important, you know, to have some kind of unity, right? Not just from a money perspective, you know, unity as in maybe the big projects, handhold of smaller projects, right? And then the more established global exchange, you know, help with the smaller projects as well because maybe they are in a region where it''s emerging, right? You mentioned about Russia. We met a friend from Kenya just now. Yeah. You know, and then yesterday I think it was Brazil, right? Yeah, Brazil. So there''s a lot of things that is really going on, you know, within the space and you, if you want to make it big, you know, and then ignore the already big exchanges right now, you know, these are the smaller markets that you can assemble and make a big difference out from what you see right now, especially where a lot of these guys that we talk to right now, they say, hey, bro, the market is bad, man. I think it''s a mindset, you know? Yeah. I''m not sure if you agree. No, I definitely agree. And I think, like you said, for exchanges or partners, like projects right now, it''s very important to really work together. And not just incentivize, because if your community, you build your community based on incentives, they''re not loyal, that basically someone that come to you today for airdrops, go to another community next day for another airdrop. So that''s not something that we really look for. We want to back projects as much as possible to really build a very loyal community and exactly what you mentioned just now. Yeah. I again emphasize that unity is the most important thing. Yeah. You know, for me, you know, as you know, I''m very neutral, right? But whenever I see a very good community, right, not so much of a project, to be honest, because if the project is good, usually I think the community is actually walking the talk. Yeah. Right. So it would be easier for us to spot good projects on X when you see that there is a big amount of real community backing it up. You know, whether it''s going to be through airdrop, whether it''s going to be through a promotion with an exchange. Yeah. It''s just so obvious, right? If it''s bots, to me, at least they have made some effort. But then most of the time, if it''s real, real, real community members, you can see the actions that they do, the kind of feedback that they give, you know, it''s very different. So I treasure those, you know. I believe Wix and a lot of these quality projects or exchanges, they are looking at that kind of input. Right? So many people show under my posts. Yeah. Right? Sometimes it''s fun, right? But at the same time, filtering out the best project, right? You know, some of my friends are here, you know, it''s actually the toughest. Yeah. And if you guys don''t follow Andy on Twitter, you guys definitely should. He''s very active there. And I think a lot of value actually provided there. And I really like something that you mentioned just now. So a lot of exchanges are actually looking for this kind of projects, but it''s not easy to find right now. It''s definitely not easy. So if any projects, you know, I definitely do hope you guys go the route where you guys really build a unity community, and not just a quick, you know, quick one or two months projects and then you move on to the next. I think that''s something that really should change in the space. Yep. But Andy, I really want to talk to you about, I mean, because you''re very an expert in the space and experience in the space as well. So when it comes to the exchange atmosphere, like the ecosystem, where do you see like exchanges moving towards in the next one or two years? Like what role do you see actually just play in like the whole Web3 space right now? I think right now it''s actually very obvious that users, for example, they are looking for exchanges who can offer them an extra layer of security. Right? So like what you guys are doing, I think it''s fair, you know, but what people really, really want, you know, is about accessibility on-ramp, off-ramp. Yeah. Because if you notice, you know, some friends might agree, yeah? They make money, but it''s getting tougher and tougher for them to get it off-ramp. Yep. Right? So if an exchange is able to provide that additional punch, you know, to make sure that the money can safely flow out through a legitimate way, I think that would be a big plus, right? This is number one. Yeah. Number two is that I think we will see lesser and lesser of those KOL-driven exchange. Why is it so? Because I''m not sure if some of you are around, but the exchanges, they like traffic. I like traffic too, you know, but the KOLs are just like butterflies, right? They shift from A to B to C with the same users, right? So sooner or later, exchanges role is also to help us see what are the good KOLs that you should really talk to and work with. And those that are sticking with the right kind of exchanges, they would actually get the most benefit out from that. Not just the KOL, you know, or the influencer, but also for the users or the retail nommies that are following the KOL and following the exchange. It becomes a really healthy flow of user base, you know, within the space. I see that in Asia a lot. You know, I''m very active in South Korea, Japan, Southeast Asia. You see that the trend is very obvious. You know, they are looking for an exchange that they can be with for a long time, you know? And again, you know, through some of the AMA sessions that I have online, you know, some of these nommies, they will ask questions that you would never expect. They will ask me things like, okay, how much does it take to be listed on the B brand exchange, right? Okay, you tell them it''s free. They will say, oh, okay, it''s free. How do they make money? So you start to explain. But nowadays users will ask me, so and so exchange, for example, in order to lease in weeks, is there a listing fee? You know, they want to know whether that exchange is a B2B exchange where they just want listing fee for big revenue. We don''t want to mention who else, right? I know how much they are asking, but some of these exchanges are literally using exchange listing fee as a form of survivor. Right? So now, now, nommies are asking me questions like this. They say, bro, how much does it go to the B brand or the K brand or the C brand? I was like, oh man, good. You know, they are using that as a benchmark, whether this exchange is something that they should put some effort to it, right? Or is it really for the people, right? For the community. So that is a very big thing that most of these people or exchanges are not talking about it, right? Normies are actually asking these questions in specific AMAs or private groups. And I think that this is one important metrics that we should share. You know, I agree. And then things should be transparent, right? Yeah. Yeah. I definitely agree with the three points that you mentioned, right? Off-Ram, on-prem, accessibility. That''s something that Wix has been really focused on and security as well, which is why we established the 1000 Bitcoin Protection Fund. And KWALs, when you talk about KWALs, I actually have a lot of experience with KWALs and definitely agree. Not every KWAL is worth partnering up with. And you really have to filter out those good KWALs. Something that I do is I make sure all my KWALs are actually a genuine user of our platform. If you''re not, you can''t be shilling this thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Andy, other than the exchanges side, I mean, I know you''re very active with projects, memes. I mean, I know you love memes. Where do you see the whole projects, memes market trend going towards in the next one or two years? Okay. I want to make a bit of correction. I love memes because they are fun and also because they have a very good community base. Yep. Right. So I think right now the trend is pretty obvious. I saw some friends as well. So it''s very obvious. We see meme coins as a door opener. Right. It''s an easy entry. You know, people can explain very, very well. You know, through the people I met, you know, they are very enthusiast. Right. So entering using memes, but how these memes can survive, it depends on how many members you can get. Right. And what is the kind of narrative that you can provide. Right. So a typical roadmap is start with a meme, followed by a nice utility. Right. And then maybe later on, you could even do a lot of big things. Right. Like yesterday we saw Paji, right? Paji Penguins. You know, they have a merge. Right. And so forth. But to be very honest, you know, if you have a really big fan base, for example, maybe I have not such a big one, but I could form an Andy Cafe or something. Right. I''m not a meme, but I could be a meme. Right. So it could be an Andy Cafe. And then it becomes a more franchise model where everyone in the world can start to network at the cafe. So it becomes a global clubhouse. Right. Okay. And of course, we could also work with exchanges like Wigs, you know, and other partners so that we can gather small groups of people at the cafe, you know, and they become a very sustainable business. Right. Whether the cafe money is used to burn the token or whatever. I don''t care. But the main thing is there should be a journey, you know, for all these memes to carry on. Because most of the memes, if you are not the top 300 or 500, there''s no way you can survive. Right. So if you need to survive, you need to partner. And if you need to partner, you should look at number one exchanges or people in the Web3 space. But think about it. There''s a lot of other money to be made, you know, in the Web2 space, you know, and it''s easier to make ourselves look a lot sexier in front of the Web2 guys. Right. So cafe could be one thing. Merch can be one thing. But ultimately, you get your community to work for their own back. Right. If they can work for their own back, the sustainability of the project can go a lot longer, super long. You know, it could last to the next cycle. The problem with the projects nowadays is that they have a nice meme, just a nice meme. Right. They have no plans. They have very poor leaders, you know, that didn''t know anything apart from just bull posting. Meaning, oh, I''m feeling good today. The meme is very happy. Shit, man. We don''t want to hear this, man. We want to see price action. Right. We want to see real partnerships. You know, so the reason why I''m sitting here with Wigs, you know, with Thomas and my other friend, Andy and so forth, is that you see that exchanges are genuinely trying to find good communities. Right. If they can find a good community, whether it''s a new community, old community and so forth, they form the partnership and it''s going to be win-win for everybody. Win-win for the project. Right. Instead of giving the money from them to some KOLs that are just shitty, give it to the project. Yeah. Right. So, again, normies are really clever. They ask me about exchange fees, exchange listing fees. They ask about how they can be the referral, you know, instead of giving the money to a KOL, like maybe a wannabe KOL like me. Right. So it''s just strange, you know, it''s just so strange. So we have to make sure that we walk on the right path, walk your own talk and make sure that you benefit back to your community. Right. Again, I''m not against KOL or influencers, but if you want to be sustainable, you have a big community, make sure that you can monetize them. Right. Yeah. So do not give the opportunity to some influencer or KOL just because they look good and they can talk very well. Every day they talk to you about Bitcoin, about all the different things and you felt happy, emotionally happy and pocket better sense. It''s a very different thing. Right. So if you are a project, you have to find the right kind of secret recipe so that you can survive. And that''s something that is really, really things that people are not talking about. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, that''s why Wix nowadays we are listing so many and supporting so many projects other than just KOLs. Yeah. And Andy, if you''re going to launch any memes, definitely let me know. I want to be frank, I don''t have the guts to launch it, you know, because I... I''ll definitely support it, like for sure. Okay. Let Tony know. I bet if 100 mil will launch this. Okay. We really need to do something good. So I think it''s a really nice thing that we have a chat here, you know, and I think some of these conversations that we have is really candid, right? Most people will not talk about listing fees and so forth on the stage and they say, oh, this guy is talking shit. But these are real things that are really happening, you know, just be mindful. And I hope everybody can do well in this bull run.? Yeah. And, and then... And Dr D Stage they need to, let them know. They''re taking a look at me, you know. They don''t know. They''re driving air now. And but C!'' And the balloons that all of this is included. Yeah. Mand Falling one''s coming off so they do well. The box waiting for the IL. And when ze wanted to steal you, they couldn''t innale them. I mean, they can erase you. And they canider tablet of all the things and incision goes into. By the way, if you''re not feeling so much he will be able to call them stuff like you, this. And, and this will be вс tray here asking up, and where they are not! And they can''t even afford anything. This is an example from me, and they''ll create something similar. Thank you.', 'Hi everybody, my name is Thomas and I''m currently the Vice President of Weeks.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('6605b15436', 'Joining Forces for the Next Chapter in Hong Kong''s Digital Asset Ecosystem', '待定', ' Panel Discussions', ' Hello everyone. Thanks for having me today. I''m here to actually announce a very exciting and transformational partnership that we are doing in Hong Kong. So as you all know, Hong Kong is a leading international financial center. We have robust regulatory framework. We have international standards, deep talent pools. And over the past few years, Hong Kong has been pursuing, working together to make ourselves a digital hub, a global digital hub, digital asset hub, to make sure we ride on these advantages that we''re having. For me, at Standard Chartered Bank, we also believe digital assets will shape our industry. And it will become a key component of the future financial infrastructure. Of course, we fully intend to be an integral part of its future state. For example, at Standard Chartered Group, we have built capabilities in custody, in tokenization, and some of them with the ventures, our partners. And in Hong Kong, Standard Chartered Bank, together with our partners, have been actively participating in building the ecosystem for Hong Kong to become the global digital hub. And some of them include Ensemble, eHongKongDollar, and Enbridge. And of course, the Hong Kong MA stablecoin issuer sandbox is an important one for us. We support the work around tokenized money as it pertains to central bank digital currency, CBDC, tokenized deposits, of course, stablecoins. So I''m here because following on, I''m going to introduce the panel of the partnership. If I look at how this partnership works is we''re very excited to have, of course, CBHK, AnyMoker Brands, Hong Kong Telecom. We agreed to form a JV venture to seek Hong Kong MA license when available to order Hong Kong dollar stablecoins. This partnership has started 663 days ago. That was the first time we met AnyMoker and we had the first email talking about that. And today, we are very proud to be here to bring three people together, which is the oldest issuing bank, ourself, one of the biggest Web3 investors in Hong Kong, AnyMoker, and our very, very own Hong Kong Telecom to deliver this market-leading stablecoin issuer. I''m sure the panel will speak a lot more how they have been working in the last 600 days, but we are really very proud to announce it here. And thank you to your support. Please welcome to the stage Evan Ollier, Marcos Chow, Dominic Mathay, and Nicolè Shta. Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you to my wonderful panelists. My name is Nic. I''m with CoinDesk. I''m joined today by Evan, Marcos, and Dominic. Let''s get right to it. We just heard from Mary about this new joint venture. I would love to know, how do we get to this point where we''re talking about this joint venture licensed stablecoin product coming from the three of you? Yeah, I mean, I can start. It was a partnership that we''re thinking that made a lot of sense. We individually, as companies, were exploring because Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government was actually exploring the space anyway, in CBDC, eHongKongDollar, and stablecoin. And we were through different dialogues. We were actually talking already. And then just one day, we were like, we just contacted each other and like, why don''t we just do it together? And this combination of having a bank, right, which has all the on-off ramps, and a native Web3 company like ourselves, plus a very on-the-ground, you know, Hong Kong, you know, POC-level company would make sense in the joint venture to promote the stablecoin. It''s 663 days till announcement, right? So it''s already, it''s not crypto speed, but it''s very, very fast for a regulated stablecoin. I think to add to that, it''s not the first time we''ve worked together. I think on different ventures, a different engagement. So it''s one of those ongoing friendships and partnerships that, you know, we continue to do. So this is one example. And we''re looking forward to more future partnerships in this. Yeah. Great. Look, the bank, the bank''s the oldest note issuing bank in Hong Kong. So a project like this is really core to our DNA. That coupled with the fact that the bank''s been working on digital asset capability for years. About six, seven years ago, Estee Ventures, Alex Manson, that team started pioneering some of the capabilities for the bank. That coupled with that DNA made us have a high conviction that we could create a world-class stablecoin issuer. We think stablecoins are going to be instrumental to any high functioning digital asset ecosystem. So for us to work together on a project like this, we see this as an opportunity to help collaborate and support the regulator as we build out a truly digital asset hub. I think all three of us as Hong Kong stalwarts, as key to the community here, had a real aligned interest and the same vision. And that''s what I think really enabled these conversations 663 days ago to culminate in us sitting here today. So I''m kind of curious just what the timeline is from here. What are the progressions that we''re looking at? Well, I mean, it''s going to go into the first reading from LetchCo. It''s already completed. We''ll go to the second and third reading at some point, which is probably expected in Q2. And then there''ll be licensing. Right? So, and then there''s about launch, about readiness. But obviously everything happens in the kitchen at the back. We''re working tirelessly at this point amongst all of us to get the tech ready. And the regulatory sandbox, by the way, is a dialogue that the JV has together with the HKMA about how do we do this in a way that has the proper regulatory rails, consumer protection, you know, and also the right commercial arrangements so that this is viable. So, I think for us in here, it''s been a long journey. And right now, as I mentioned, we''re getting everything in place. So the joint venture was announced a couple of days ago. We''re all ready to go. So we want to front run this. And of course, the HKT Digital Ventures team have been working tirelessly on this, like Monita, Felix, you know, they''re really the architects behind this. And we''re all so pumped and so excited. We''re waiting for us to issue up a stable coin. Right. Yeah. I''m not much tied. Okay. That''s it, right? So that''s the process. You know, a big journey to get here. A great milestone. Still a lot to do. And I think we''re all geared up and ready to do it. So. So I think for me, one of the key words in what we''re all discussing is this is a licensed stable coin. And I really hope you can maybe just get into, you know, why is it being a licensed product? Why is this regulatory framework important for, you know, why not just issue a stable coin? Yeah. I mean, I''ll get into it as a native Web3 company. I can''t emphasize how important this is. Anymoca sort of as a background as a gaming company went pretty deep into the NFT digital asset space. Right. But when we were even selling NFTs, we were insistent on KYC. It''s very important for us to understand that once you financialize something, yes, you want decentralization. But at the same time, what is important for mass adoption is that there are rails that would guard against some of the, you know, everyday issues that you will have with sort of money laundering, you know, and, you know, CTF and all of that. Right. So partnering with a bank and also a institution like HKT has been here for so long. It''s really important to, you know, certify that this is institutional. Right. There are many stable coins as we know in the world. Why is this one different? Right. This one is different because it''s regulated, it''s licensed. Right. And ultimately, Web3 is about decentralizing trust. Right. But you do have to operate under the rails of regulations that actually exist. Right. It''s not these are not in conflict in many ways. Right. The banking rails that allows the on and off ramp are actually very good. We might talk about antiquated systems in terms of the SWIFT system, you know, corresponding banking and paying out all the fees, cross border payments. That is what we''re trying to solve. 24 by 7 atomic settlement is what we''re trying to solve. But we''re not throwing everything away because, you know, because, you know, nothing works. It''s not that there''s nothing works. There are aspects of a traditional banking system that actually works. That''s why we''re marrying this together to bring the best of each of the parties to bear. I think with the regulations in place, in fact, you know, we do welcome more regulations. We are we operate in a very heavily regulated environment. By having these regulations in place, we can trust and verify with the technologies in place now. With DLT, anyone can come in and verify what we''re doing. So we offer the trust. The banks do. We do. And I think that makes it different from the other stable coins out there. I mean, you know, to use a bit of an over overused term, probably. I mean, the regulations, I think we think are a game changer, right? I mean, the reality is there''s some really great companies that have been building stable coin businesses for a number of years, many very well managed as well. But without that regulatory clarity, it''s very difficult for regulated institutions to use them properly. So by coming in with regulations that are clear, that have guidance that allows us to risk manage properly, know what targets we need to hit, this enables a stable coin to really do what I think it does and kind of should do is create that bridge, right? That traditional finance and that Web3 bridge. So, I mean, the regulations are just they''re they''re paramount. So that''s why we''ve been so eager to be a part of the stable coin sandbox. I mean, that''s been a big commitment over the last eight or nine months. But we''ve been really keen to collaborate with the regulators. We''ve been very pleased to see the progress in Hong Kong. Actually, I want to add that remember that we''re in Hong Kong, one of the most important financial centers here, right? With the geopolitical, you know, aspects that''s going on today, you know, we have to really understand the role of Hong Kong as a financial window and a center for, you know, for greater China and China assets, right? So when you talk about a neutral internet and a decentralized internet, which is what Web3 ultimately is about, we''re here participating in another, should I say, milestone, working with Hong Kong with a standard chartered and actually taking the first step of having building a more neutral financial system, right? That is based on a public blockchain that we see, right? Because many of the banking initiatives in Web3 actually on private chains, right? Here we''re working on a stable coin that is regulated on a public chain. And we were talking about public permissionless being very important. And then neutralizes sort of the aspects of sort of like putting assets on chain that is then tradable. And that''s very, very important for Hong Kong to play as a financial center. Yeah. Okay. We have a few minutes left. I want to look ahead a little bit. Yeah, as we wrap up, what''s next for each of your firms, you know, at least with regard to this project here or what you''re looking at? I think for us in here, we''ve been in the, you know, kind of the OG, Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and, you know, we continue our journey in Web 3.0. It''s something that we continue to do to look at forward-looking technologies that we can actually implement and actually use here. I think ethos for, you know, the Chef unique in Hong Kong, it''s always about cheaper, faster, and better. So anything that helps us get there, that''s the Hong Kong ethos, and that''s what we actually embrace. And I think this is the journey for us, you know. Great. So, look, the Stablecoin project, it''s a key project for us. We have high conviction. But it is just one part of the kind of puzzle we''re trying to put together as a bank, right? I mean, there''s a bunch of pieces you need to put together to have a properly functioning digital asset ecosystem. And I said the bank''s been working on this for about six years. The bank has a global digital asset custody business that''s looking to roll out. We''ve done in UAE. It''s happening in Lux. We''re looking forward to it happening in Hong Kong. SC Ventures, our venture arm, has done a bunch around different digital asset business models. We''ve got Zodiac Custody, Zodiac Markets. We have a company, Libera, here. It''s a tokenization platform in Hong Kong. That''s been a bunch of really interesting work. Some of you probably saw the announcement with China AMC. I mean, it''s all a puzzle. We''re kind of putting this all together. The Stablecoin, obviously, super important part of that puzzle. But, you know, the bank is really about creating the infrastructure to make a functioning digital asset hub. And we think that that not only benefits Hong Kong, but we think that globally that helps put together the whole ecosystem. Yeah, so for Animoca, we are native at Web3 Frame, as we said. So we are in this as well of the major initiatives into the institutional space. So we already have a partnership with Neom. And we''re discussing various aspects of how we can join up as well, right, in terms of something like this project. In terms of sort of where we are, we''re very ambitious because we want to change the ecosystem. We want to spur, propel the development of the ecosystem, right? We have really three business pillars, right? We have the business, sort of operating business pillar, which is, you know, one of the gaming companies'' sandbox, right? Not the regulatory sandbox, but the sandbox, the game. It''s one of our assets. And there''s the native side of it and there''s the institutional side of it. The institutional side of it really is the one that we hope to expand our partnership with Standard Chartered and hopefully Hong Kong as we go forward with this. But the other pillars, which is advisory and investments, we''re still trying to push on that. And hopefully with our 500 investments that we have, we''re known to be a pretty large VC. We made about 100 investments last year alone. Hopefully the stable coin. Again, we start off the Hong Kong dollar, but we''ll explore, of course, other possibilities as well. Hopefully this is the rail that ties in our ecosystem as well. And we have a project prominently called Mochaverse that some folks here might have heard about. It''s a decentralized ID layer, a reputation system. Again, the stable coin can play into that ecosystem to activate and tie it together. So lots of very exciting things happening. We''re very excited to have the institutional rail under good regulations and interacting with the native side so that we can bring Web3 to masses. We''re going to have three to masses. Gotcha. Yeah. Just through this to the masses, we''ve also enabled GoWallet with a blockchain-based wallet in there. So when stable coins come in, then it''ll be easier for us to reach out to our consumers here in Hong Kong. Gotcha. Key use case for us. Absolutely. All right. We have about 30 seconds left. Any closing thoughts? Well, I''ll tell you this. When we posted the announcement, we got the native side of Twitter saying that this changes everything. So I would end with that. Thank you. For me and the team, we''re super excited to be here. And in this space right now, I think there''s no better place to be. Yeah. Great. Yeah. We''re very excited as well. A lot happened in the last 660 days, but we''ve got a lot more to do in the next couple hundred. So, yeah. Thank you. Awesome. Well, thank you again. Thank you, Dominic from Standard Chartered, Marcos from Hong Kong Telecom, and Evan from Animoca. Thank you all. Stick around. We have a number of great sessions still happening. So thank you all.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('9576093edc', 'Creating Crypto Projects at Scale', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Well, today we have a wonderful panel going into creating crypto projects at scale. And scale means a lot of different things that we''ll get into this afternoon. I''ll have our panelists introduce themselves. Quickly, I''ll be your moderator for today. I''m Camilla McFarland. I work leading strategy at G20 Group, a global asset manager, market maker, treasury manager, firm, also a venture partner at Fabric Ventures on the VC side. So we work with lots of different projects and lots of different parts of the ecosystem. I spent most of my career at Serotonin, the leading Web3 marketing firm, and also a consensus in the Ethereum community in the early days. And I''ll pass it over to Matt Senix from the Magic Eden Foundation. Hi, everybody. I''m Matt, EMI Foundation. And I lead the foundation, which is the steward of the protocols that power Magic Eden. And before that, I was a business lead at Magic Eden for the last three years. Hi, my name is Justin. I''m head of Asia for Alva Labs, overseeing business development and ecosystem in Asia. So I think my major involvement was MapleStory Universe out of Korea. There''s Suntory and there are financial institutions. So we''re all about scaling crypto projects. So we''re excited to be here. Great. Amazing. Well, we are hearing from a layer one blockchain today and also sort of wallet market infrastructure. So different parts of the stack. To start us off and to frame the discussion, what are the key ingredients for scaling? So what are the must-haves for scaling a project? And if you will, what are the biggest mistakes some teams make? Either one of you, feel free to jump in. Oh, man. So many mistakes that we''ve made, honestly, in the past, like, three years. And they''re, like, good mistakes because, like, we obviously learned a lot. But I think some of the core ingredients, and I''m thinking back to the early days, is choosing that early team really wisely. And it''s, you know, the early team sort of shapes the culture of the growing team so much. And I''ve learned this from the founders, too, and watching the company grow over the years. The folks that stay do shape the culture. So I think it''s sort of, like, a soft, you know, thing and, like, hard to measure. But finding, like, these culture carriers early on that could still have the vision so many years later is super, super important. A lot of that comes from the founders. But I think I place, like, a lot of value in finding, like, that early team that could kind of help scale. And also scale themselves over the years. So I''ll just say that. That''s super important. Yeah. It is. It''s true. If you have a culture of excellence and execution in crypto, it means the world of difference. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I mean, I remember, like, our early team was actually, like, a good mix of actual, like, degens that are in the trenches that are, you know, trading NFTs, tokens, et cetera. Web to, like, ex-product leaders at big tech companies. And some of the best engineers I''ve ever worked with. And, you know, we have that 100x engineer that we thankfully started with. He''s one of the co-founders. And so that mix was actually super important to get off the ground. It''s a mix of, like, understanding go-to-market, understanding business, understanding, like, what the community wants. And obviously being able to execute with the early engineering team. Yeah, definitely. What about you, Justin? Yeah, I think I probably speak from the operator''s standpoint because we''re a layer one blockchain, right? So I think Avalanche came into the space with a very, very clear vision. The future of blockchain will be many blockchains. But what I mean by many blockchains, it''s not going to be a lot of general purpose blockchains. It''s going to be a lot of purpose-built blockchains. Just working backwards, the thought process for this scaling of crypto projects. We need millions of users and thousands of apps. But when you actually toss it in, like, millions of users and thousands, millions of apps just into one chain, it''s going to get clocked up. That''s how blockchain is because you have to communicate with different validators all over the world. It''s really hard to scale technically, right? So the vision of Avalanche is most of these projects will need their own layer one blockchain, basically their own execution environment because corporates, gaming projects, they''re under a lot of compliance and jurisdictional requirements. But they see the value of using a bit of crypto, a bit of blockchain to scale the project. So there''s just one game coming up on Avalanche off the grid. It''s a major AAA gaming. It has 13 million users since November. It''s being operated on PlayStation. It''s the first game to be operating on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC. And it''s printing more than 4 million transactions a day. And last year, I think one of the days, one of the lowest days for Ethereum''s transaction was like 80K, 0.8 million, right? So if you need to be a really, really scaling project, you''ll probably need your own execution environment. So that''s the vision of Avalanche. And we actually have a really easy platform to just deploy your own L1s. So that''s where we''re going at. Yeah. That, I would love to stay on the tech stack question for a second. Because obviously, you know, there''s a lot of layer one blockchains and crypto. There''s a lot of block space, if you will. Yes. All discussion around how do they scale. And also, if they do all scale and reach a level of scale, we all imagine, I think, a world where they will interoperate with each other. Whether that''s cross-chain bridges or some sort of interoperable tech. But if everything sort of reaches the scale that we all imagine and that we''re starting to see in some cases on the gaming side or on the deep end side, what does that world look like? You know, if Magic Eden scales and Avalanche scales, I imagine they''ll interact with each other. Either of you, where do you think of scale when it comes to sort of like interoperability? Yeah, I''ll probably start with, I''ll just add on to the gaming space, right? So there''s off-the-grid game. And at the same time, we also have this other major gaming IP coming out of Korea, which is MapleStory Universe. It''s a game that''s been here for 20 years with 250 million users over 20 years. So when there are two gamings operating on their own chains, you definitely need these two games to exchange ideas, exchange assets, exchange messages, right? So the architecture of Avalanche is basically you can deploy L1s whenever you want, and there''s already a native sort of bridge and interchain messaging. So when you have a skin in this one game, and you''ll be awarded, I don''t know, tokens or games, that''s already built in as a very crucial part of Avalanche. So, I mean, I think we are ready in terms of the technicality here. Yeah. Yeah. And from the perspective of a dApp that''s grown over the years into supporting many different chains, I think what I''ll say is, like, what we care about a lot is building that relationship with the user, because we''re a dApp, and we build UI and fun things for users. And we want to have that relationship. So that''s our focus. And I think in scaling over the years and thinking about infrastructure, what I''ll say is we actually don''t want to spend that much time thinking about infra and scaling. And therefore, what we look to do, like, going forward is actually looking at partners that have very scalable infrastructure, like L2s of the world that you could very easily build on top of. And nowadays, it''s actually a lot easier than it used to be, because when we started, we built a stack from the ground up on Solana, then we expanded on to Bitcoin, and building on Bitcoin is pretty jank, I''ll just say it. It''s pretty hard. So, like, looking forward, I actually think a lot of the content will come from the EVM ecosystem, just given how quickly you could spin up an app chain, how quickly you could have content be on chain. And, yeah, that''s sort of, like, where I see the future going. And, obviously, that''s projects like Avalanche. Yeah. I want to move. So, we''ve talked about tech scale. The unavoidable other part of the curtain, if you will, is the token question. And I know there''s lots of projects here today that are thinking about launching a token that have a token. It''s sort of the oxygen in the room in crypto that keeps your project going. In a lot of ways, launching the token is your product launch. In a lot of ways, your first product launch, because it''s done before you launch your tech. So, it''s what your consumer first interacts with. Both of you have, your projects have tokens. Magic Eden were recently. Just some thoughts about how to navigate that. There''s the marketing side of it. There''s the capital market side of it, of good liquidity and listings and discoverability and all of it. Like, how do you approach tokens as part of the scale and ongoing scale and longevity of your project? Excellent question. Because I think there''s, like, you see two examples here. And, like, both of us, from our project perspective, we didn''t choose the same path. An L1 and L2 infrastructure companies, they have a very different goal with the token. And as do dApps. I think it''s very different goals. So, for us, we started out, you know, three years ago as a small salon of marketplace. And we were lucky to find product market fit. And we had some success in gaining users. And not all projects are, like, really privileged in having that. And we actually thought about when is the right time to launch a token, like, over the years. And ultimately, we chose to just double down on building the business and building a better user trap. And so, that''s, you know, that''s culminated over the years in expanding to different chains, launching a wallet. And now there''s, you know, millions of users that use the marketplace across different chains. And thankfully, like, we had the privilege of being able to wait. But the token was a very important part of the equation. And the way we thought about it was, like, we''ll launch it when we''re ready to take the company to the next level. Is sort of how we thought about it. And when we could have that incentive lever to power products. And so, that''s how we thought about it. And that''s what we did. When we went to market with our new wallet, we made the claim of the token exclusively available only in the wallet. And it drove a lot of users to the wallet. And people started using the wallet more. And actually, it was a great success because now there''s, like, 100,000 users in the wallet. Which we wouldn''t have had if, you know, we didn''t actually force them to download it. Which is good. It''s, like, a good way to, like, direct people to different places. Now that we have a scaled user base. But, yeah, we chose to wait. Thankfully, we had some product market fit. Right. And I think that''s one of the key sort of questions. You have to, like, understand. Do you have a big enough user base to sort of, like, power your business for the next few years? And if so, I would say double down on that. And then think about the token afterwards. But it does, as a crypto company, they do play important roles. So, like, you always have to keep it in the back of your head. Yeah, definitely. It''s interesting because both of you come from sort of different perspectives of the token side. You know, you had a product. Because of where you sit on the stack for Magic Eden, you had a product. You had users. You had interactions before the token. But obviously, the nature of a layer one blockchain, you need the token to launch for mainnet to function for people to use your blockchain. So, how do you see tokens as part of scale? I''m actually, like, Avalanche is layer one blockchain. So, the token had to be there on the first day. Sure. Because it''s a guest token of the network. But looking at more, like, crypto projects launching on this network, different networks, I think it''s better to actually show conviction and earn conviction with the actual users during the early phase. Like, there are gamings with beta play that''s inviting a lot of users. And they actually see the value of this project, right? Magic Eden proved to a global audience that this is going to be the leading marketplace for, you know, a different flavor of NFTs, right? So, I think it''s important and better. So, like, if you''re really confident about your project, I think it''s better to launch tokens later compared to, like, what we did at Avalanche with layer one, right? Yeah. Yeah. Just to say on this topic a little more, because I know it''s top of mind for a lot of people at the moment, you know, launching the token is just one step of it. Then you are now forever in crypto, essentially a publicly listed company with a token and a share price. You''re on the foundation side now. And obviously, Avalabs is funded in a lot of ways by the foundation to support the development on the network and support dApps being built on top of Avalanche. How do you think about the foundation and as part of sort of, like, the forever journey of keeping your project alive, being able to fund development and scale in the future as sort of, like, an engine to scale for your projects? Yeah. I could go first. It''s exactly what you said, actually. It''s that engine that could fund a lot of new user experiences in the future. And that''s how we thought about it. But also, like, how we think about the token is almost like, hey, we want people in the ecosystem that like to use the Magic Eden apps. I''ll say, like, the apps ecosystem to actually have ownership and a stake in what''s being built. So an important part of this was launching governance for it. Yeah. And we wanted to make sure that our biggest believers actually have the biggest say in how it develops over the future. It''s, like, one of the key tenants of Web3, right? Allowing. It''s like the alignment. Exactly. Exactly. And so what we did is we basically gave people a staking system. And if, you know, you stake for, we gave them essentially like a way to choose how long they stake. And people just, some people like that are big believers just said, I''m staking my thing for four years. I don''t care. And, you know, when you move that little cursor over in the staking UI, you''re also moving your voting power over. So we''re essentially like aligning your incentives and we''re aligning the true believers to be also the people with the most voice in the ecosystem and ability to shape the protocols and the direction. And then also what you have there is like a way, like a, you know, a true 1,000 believers, let''s call it, like the true 1,000 fans. And that user group, you could reward over time. You could, like, take them in closer to the labs and company and, you know, bring them into the fold of development and get their feedback. And it''s actually like a really good flywheel and good tool to have the community have more participation in the ecosystem. Yeah, definitely. What about you, Justin? Yeah, so for Avalanche, we have Avalanche Foundation and there''s Avalanche. So I''m actually part of the Avalanche. And Avalanche is actually the software service company promoting the ecosystem and the business development for Avalanche Foundation. Right. So we have a clear distinction in terms of roles. So the Avalanche Foundation is a nonprofit. At the same time, the people at Avalanche, we bring expertise and we actually bring services. Like deploying L1 takes a lot of resources. So we actually have a business that actually accrues revenue when we actually provide consultation for launching on L1. That includes tokenomics, business development. We make connections to other partners. So we actually provide professional services. So we try to keep the roles of foundation and Avalanche different. But we are aligned because we''re all for, you know, a bigger ecosystem on Avalanche. Great. So we''ve covered the tech stack. We''ve covered the token side, the foundation side. In our last sort of minute, this is obviously the first year consensus is in Asia. Asia, how do you see Asia for the geography question? And obviously, Justin, you''re head of Asia for Avalanche. So maybe you can start us off. Yeah. How do you see Asia as a crucial part of scale for sort of the next group? I think Asia is a leading geography really for the crypto as an industry. Because just looking at the names of partners that we have in Asia, it''s SK, the second largest conglomerate in Korea. The MapleStory, the largest gaming studio, maybe in the whole world. One of the Suntory is a whiskey brand out of Japan coming into Avalanche, bringing their products. So what we''re seeing here is that financial institutions and corporates are curious and interested in experimenting crypto and blockchain technologies to improve their business, which we really don''t have a lot in the U.S. So I think Asia, looking at these partnerships, is definitely leading and contributing to the industry as a whole. Fantastic. Yeah. Yeah. Big plus one. Maybe people don''t know, but Magicine is a really well-known brand in Western markets and English-speaking markets. But we also have a pretty big brand in places like Korea. Yep. 60% of the trading of our token actually happens in Korea. 60%? Yeah, it''s pretty insane. 60% on Upbit only. And then you add the other exchanges, it''s actually more. And we managed to do that by building on-the-ground community in these markets. And I''d say going forward, our focus will be Asia, for sure, 100%. Because, one, we''re underpenetrated. Right. And, two, I think our products and the things that we build actually resonate a lot with folks. And we''re starting with Korea as the first focused market that we''ll expand to in a big way. And then we''re going to go to Southeast Asia and all the other markets as well. Great to hear, Matt. Well, that''s fantastic, guys. Thank you for your time. And thank you all for coming. And everyone will be probably just outside in the back after the panel if you want to ask them questions. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('9852421f37', 'How Sovereign Wealth Funds are Accessing Digital Assets', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hi everybody, how you doing? Good? All right, yes, excellent. Signs of life. Thank you. Okay, so we''re going to talk about everybody''s favorite topic, how to pester sovereign wealth funds for money. And I strongly encourage right after this session, just swarm these guys. They love it. Just go right after them. Okay, so thank you so much both for coming. My dear friends, really appreciate it. So what I love about this panel now is we have representation of how sovereign wealth funds are adapting to ensure that they stay in the center of deal flow for high-tech innovation. And we''ve got two very different ways of approaching it. So Mohamed Hamdi has done this through an external vehicle, which he''ll explain in a moment. And my dear friend Hamoud has done this internally within the Omani Investment Authority. But both are great examples of the types of structures and people that sovereign wealth funds are now engaging with and hiring to make sure that they stay in the center of strong deal flow. So let''s start with Hamdi. So really quick, let''s talk about the structure you were able to set up with ADQ and how you act as that arm for tech innovation and crypto especially. Thanks for having me. So the structure is a very simple GP LP structure. We have a sovereign that''s an LP in our fund. And this allows us to actually have full discretion as managers to be able to act on behalf of the LPs, including our sovereign, in investing and also a very specific operating model where we actually venture build from within our studio as well. The progression of us coming to a legal structure like that started off when we were executing on behalf of a sovereign entity from within the institution in building specific projects for them where they quickly realized that there was a lot of red tape. And it actually was very, very interesting for us to maintain nimbleness and be able to actually move quick in decision-making and in recruiting talent and being able to compensate talent for some of the builds that we were actually executing. So it was a very quick opportunity for us to convince our stakeholders and LP that a GP LP structure would make the most sense for us. Got it. When did you set that up? So we got licensed in September 2022. Okay. Yeah. We''ll talk in a second. I have a thesis that post-COVID, it was a bit of an awakening for lots of the sovereign wealth funds in terms of their desire to get out more and recognize the value of sourcing deal flow external to the region. But we''ll talk about that in a second. So, Hamoud. So, internally, you work in the technology department. You work in private markets. You''re VC. You have a background in deal sourcing. So, kind of talk through how your role developed and how you work in that way at the OIA. Sure. So, there was a first VC-focused fund that was established in Oman. This was an international-focused fund called IBM Investments. This came to play by a partnership between Oman Investment Authority and Oman Oil at that time. They were the main energy and oil stakeholders, essentially, and OmanTel. So, it was about $130 billion, up paid capital, and we were instructed to deploy this capital internationally into technologically innovative companies and, essentially, growth-stage companies that can have some form of value. The technology or service can have some form of value to the Middle East and can cater to our service and challenges, to the challenges that we have in the Middle East, and this can be quite wide. It can be food security, cyber security, water, monitoring surveillance, etc. So, yeah, we''ve been running this VC arm since 2017, and we''ve also been focusing on doing direct investments for OIA. That would be higher-ticket investments with quite a strong strategic local angle as well. So, we''ve done deals like XAI, SpaceX, and Crusoe, which is a digital flare mitigation technology that uses flare gas for crypto mining and intensive computing. So, how do you ensure that you don''t have an adverse selection? Look, obviously, the OIA is a very, very respected investor, and everyone I know who''s looking to raise capital, it''s on their short list of firms like to target. But, obviously, it''s challenging as a startup to fly from Silicon Valley all the way out to Oman to have that and build and engage, because this isn''t just one meeting, right? You have to invest time and energy. So, they''re stranded to some degree in these centers of excellence, whether it''s Tokyo, London, New York, Silicon Valley. How do you ensure that you''re accessing strong deal flow? Because cyber wealth funds are not generally known for externalizing their offerings, right? It''s unusual to see you speak at conferences like this. This is a relatively recent post-COVID thing. So, how do you ensure that you don''t have an adverse selection problem in deal sourcing? Yeah, I mean, I think, like, funds like OIA, I mean, we''ve been committed to top quartile funds worldwide, VCPE, so we try to, we''re in quite a good relationship with them and try to get co-investment rights and whatnot. So, we try to get, you know, the best that we can out of these relationships. So, they tend to send us the best deals that they have and, you know, not the, you know, not the bad, not the bad deals. Of course, we did also invest quite a lot of time into, into visits and trying to kind of get some market insight into specific sectors, try to see what companies are doing, what the most innovative companies are doing in each sector. So, in our team, we have specific sector champions, essentially, that talk to the experts until they become the experts and they would essentially know the top companies in the space, know the smart money that''s chasing good companies in the space and whatnot. Yep. But, yeah, I think we leverage a lot of the, this, these top quartile GP relationships. So, we''ve gotten quite good, many good deals from them as well. So, Hamdi, you were one of the first specialty vehicles, sovereign-backed specialty vehicles focused, I mean, not exclusively, but predominantly on crypto. Yeah. And that made a big splash. So, talk me through, like, you know, and we heard recently, last week it became public, Mombadla has over $400 million of Bitcoin ETF exposure. So, where are we in the cycle of sovereign wealth funds embracing this particular innovation? Yeah. So, I just wanted to just touch on a specific point on governments and what they are potentially doing today. I think what''s very important for an ecosystem is to actually not just fund grassroots initiatives like accelerators and startups directly. I think managers with different perspectives are also important to have capital to be able to deploy. I think that''s very, very important. The ecosystem just doesn''t need talent and startups. The ecosystem also needs different operators and investors to have different perspectives on what they should invest in. That''s extremely important. And I mention that because there has been an understanding that emerging managers are very, very important and it is up to sometimes sovereign wealth funds to actually anchor these emerging managers and help support them in their first fund. So, that''s a very important thesis that helped us actually raise capital. To your question around why our sovereign has invested and where our sovereign is going with the whole theme around digital assets and crypto, we had a very specific thesis where we felt that there''s a convergence between financial services and digital assets. We felt that this was a thesis that we can actually narrate to our LPs that this is the future of finance and this is definitely a domain that they needed exposure in. So, it was them actually taking a bet on us, taking a bet on the fact that we are fund managers first and foremost. So, there''s governance, there''s compliance. We are investors before we are digital asset supporters or champions or crypto supporters and champions. This is also another opportunity for people to actually show professionalism in being a fund manager in this domain, which sometimes can lack, especially previously more so than today. I couldn''t agree more. I''ll put a final point on what you said. One of the reasons I think we need sovereign wealth funds and large asset owners is their duration and their temperance for volatility is decidedly different from allocators that have to mark to market on a quarterly or annual basis. And that''s extremely important where you''re investing in inherently volatile asset classes or early stage asset classes, right? We''ve got to have folks who are patient, large capital to incubate these businesses. So, Hamoud, I know that OIA doesn''t currently invest directly in crypto, although you mentioned indirectly through Flaregas, Bitcoin mining. So, more general questions. So, you''re on the VC side. You''re on the emerging technology side. If you start to see interest in an innovative tech, so whether it''s artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency, whatever it is, what is the process? How do you start to shift that huge battleship of OIA around to get interested in that technology? What can we do as market participants, as innovators, as operators, as experts to provide the information or the market infrastructure so that an OIA could eventually make a decision to allocate even a minority position to a new technology? Yeah, I think we... Well, the first step of the process for us, it''s, yes, we do look for financial return, but also local strategic impact. So, I mean, you essentially need to outline quite a challenge that''s quite prevalent in the country where it gets to, for example, water desalination or whatever it is. Like, we have to desaline seawater. It''s a very expensive process. So, it''s quite, you know, it''s a very precious commodity. So, you try to... I mean, the way that we would go with this, have a top... I mean, the way that I would do it is have a top-down approach. So, try to see what kind of challenges are most prevalent in the country. For example, it gets to, let''s say, we need some form of ICS cybersecurity solution and for oil and gas stakeholders and for critical infrastructure. I would try to see the best companies in this space, essentially, and try to talk to the main investors in this space and try to see what everybody''s doing, try to essentially get, you know, get to the conclusion what the best company in this space is. Yeah, I mean, of course, they''re, like, a tough challenge, to the sector, you need to kind of showcase that this company has, you know, in the Middle East, generally, we tend to be a bit risk-averse. So, these companies have to have some form of de-riskification. So, revenue generation, customer attraction and whatnot, technology milestones, for example, if you''re in a biotech or healthcare. So, yeah, I think founders maybe can try to better outline how they can solve certain challenges that we have in the Middle East so that we''re not just financial investors but strategic partners for them and we can work on a common commercialization framework for them to enter Oman in the GCC market. Does it, does it, so, okay, so, just to paraphrase, so, understand what goals the OIA has for the region, try to tie the technical innovation into the solving of those problems, those issues. Does it necessarily require opening up an office in Oman, for example, or having boots on the ground? Or is that necessary for investment? No, I mean, we don''t have, like, we don''t have any other offices other than Oman. We do have some JVs with other countries like Vietnam, Uzbekistan, India, etc. And we have a lot of good GP relationships. So, for now, I don''t think there is any need for us to have any boots on the ground physically. I meant for companies looking to get investment from you. Oh, I see. Do they have to set up offices in Oman? Gotcha. No, of course, that''s not necessarily the case. I mean, the more, of course, the more hardcore the strategic impact, the better it would be. The better, like, if it''s a bigger challenge to solve when it gets to, for example, protecting, you know, sensitive infrastructure, that would be great. If it can contribute to the GDP, that would be great. Developing local talent, that would be great as well. Of course, it''s, you know, it''s a bit subjective. We don''t really have a very, you know, very, you know, quantitative way of kind of measuring the impact, but we try to kind of analyze how this company or this technology would impact Oman on several fronts when it gets to the technology, the GDP, and just the general ecosystem. Hamdi, how do you source deals? Yeah, so, the way we source is we have different inbound dynamics. We have a partnership within the fund, and a lot of our partners are actually in the game of hunting. So, to avoid adverse selection, a lot of the times we actually form a very strong opinion and a thesis that we review every quarter and we actually go and hunt out for specific ideas led by founders that are executing and we found this to be the best way to avoid adverse selection but also invest and stick to our thesis across the fund. We also have a lot of collateral, content collateral and copy that we use online that helps as well. So, sometimes we get inbound from a funnel but the reality is a lot of the times the fund is very much focused on empowering the partnership, the people, the partners to be able to go out and actually hunt for very specific ideas and ultimately our game is to convince founders that we are the right type of capital to support their idea. And you and I spoke separately, same question for you but you and I spoke separately earlier about one of the mistakes that managers and startups make is if they''re not in that short term agenda and they meet with you, they give up, they disappear, they go away and not investing in that relationship over time because that agenda might change in 18 months or two years and then if they''re starting from scratch at that point, they''re behind the eight ball and maybe they won''t hit that window. So, being committed to that, it doesn''t necessarily mean they have to fly to the UAE 10 times a year but being committed to offering you information during periods where you have said to them that you''re not on my agenda right now, we''re not making a short term investment is very important. Yeah, so, you know, unfortunately, well, the dynamic of investing in crypto and digital assets has broadened this dynamic of time as a factor in actually making an investment specifically in the underlying asset of tokens. So, time has been a huge factor here and I get that. I think we are mostly focused on being equity investors so we''re not too sensitive around time as much as entrepreneurs raising on the back of a token. So, I understand the urgency of time but the reality is sometimes investors take time to build conviction to get to know the entrepreneur to see the opportunity and that is not a, time is not something that we can afford when it comes to a token based investment. So, I empathize with entrepreneurs that are very strict with time but the reality is our dynamic being purely an equity investor for the most part it takes sometimes conviction to be built within our partnership. Yeah, I mean, don''t ever raise, don''t ever try to raise money desperate. That''s just, that''s the worst, that''s the worst thing in the world. Okay, Hamoud, same question. How do you like to source and how can entrepreneurs and startups who want to get on your radar, what''s the right way for them to get your attention? Yeah, I think committing time and developing the relationship, being hands-on and delivering on promises, not over-promising at the beginning when it gets to implementation, you know, when it gets to corporate and wide execution and also execution of the strategic GCC angle that we have agreed on. So yeah, just, I guess, being sincere and committing to the relationship, not disappearing right under the fundraise, because that would eventually, essentially, impact them also in the long run. like in OIA, we have had some circumstances where we''ve committed to the company at the beginning and we''ve committed to do so over the years just because we were very impressed with the execution of the team and the interaction and the implementation, you know, the execution was just as agreed. so they essentially definitely have benefit because we were just definitely, like, what time we were re-plowing capital but with companies that, with founders that just disappear essentially and don''t commit to a certain strategic local angle that they said they would commit to, then, you know, it''s, I mean, we likely won''t reinvest with that, with those, with those kind of founders because for us, yes, we do like financial return but at the same time we do look for developing strong partnerships and for delivering impact in the Middle East. Yeah, and we were discussing offline as well this idea that if you''re speaking to one sovereign wealth fund understand there''s an informal network, referral network with internal so you''re speaking to all of them and just make sure that you, again, even if the investment doesn''t work out, you''re big boys, you said to me, like, you''re a venture portfolio expert, like, you understand they''re going to be losers in every portfolio but there''s a right way and a wrong way to lose value and if you do it the wrong way, rest assured that entire network of sovereigns will probably hear of that, right? Absolutely. Yeah, I mean, I think it''s a small world and, you know, you know, word of mouth definitely plays a part so, at the Middle East, like, we interact with each other quite, quite, quite frequently and, yeah, we do, and of course, quite frequently with our partners in Europe and the US so, I mean, I mean, essentially, yeah, I mean, we''d essentially have some more insight than founders or some people in the US or Europe would think that we have. file. Hamdi, do you see sovereign interest in crypto growing? In crypto? In growing. Do you see this being sort of a dipping a toe in the water for a decade or do you see acceleration over the next, you know, 12 to 18 months? So, I think the way sovereigns probably look at digital assets in the domain of digital assets including crypto is that what has worked at least in our region is that we''ve always tried to create marketplaces that dominate specific industries and you''ve seen that for example with Dubai. Dubai created a massive logistics hub and, you know, they built the jurisdictions that reflected to support that industry, they built the infrastructure for that. So, I think what sovereigns would potentially be thinking about is how do they become the next digital asset hub that attracts talent, that brings favorable regulatory requirements and standards and by doing that they end up carving an edge as a country and an economic power. So, they''re seeing digital assets as a new domain that they can actually build within their countries and we''ve seen that with the UAE for example, we had an arbitrage opportunity in 2022 as a fund to avoid adverse selection. We wanted to take advantage of our regulatory favorable jurisdiction to be able to attract some of the talent, invest in them and have them actually operate within regulatory frameworks that were actually set already within the UAE. So, I would assume that a lot of sovereign wealth funds look into investing in new marketplaces and new domains and industries to help them carve an edge within their region. Right. I mean, the way you and I met indirectly was your government invited me out to speak to the Treasury Department about the impact of cryptocurrency on nation-state balance sheets. That was how I met your, that''s how we got introduced. So, I know that currently the OIA doesn''t invest directly in crypto but I do think it''s possible, what I''m hearing more and more of folks looking to see blockchain solutions for improving capital market efficiencies. So, you know, we''ve had a stock market that for whatever reason liquidity is not as robust as we want it to be. Maybe we can leapfrog technology the way we went from fiber optic lines to satellite and we leapfrog and use tokenization to improve liquidity and it''s more sort of financial market infrastructure play as opposed to a direct cryptocurrency investment. I know that this isn''t your focus but is that a potential angle you think in Oman? I think real world applications essentially blockchain solutions for real world applications this can be for example supply chain management warehouse management fried forwarding essentially. I''m not sure like maybe our central bank would like to do digital tokenization of our currency I''m not sure so these things definitely can come into play but I would assume the lowest hanging fruit is essentially solutions that can have real world applications and just an impact today can transform these truths today. real world use cases. Okay last comment Omdi what''s the one thing you want to leave the audience with? I think you know we''re still extremely early in our space there''s a lot of room to be able to deploy capital in this space there''s a lot of opportunity for operators to deploy capital in this space I obviously have a biased opinion here being an investor on this stage I''d like to see a lot more operators deploy capital and invest in this space in order to execute on the real use cases Hamoud last comment just about like how founders can what''s a mistake they make trying to get to you what do they do right? Yeah I think try to invest more time to the relationship be a bit more sincere and just essentially commit to the relationship essentially commit to the partnership thank you so much thanks gentlemen thank you everyone thank you so much thank you so much thank you so much Thank you.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.203', NULL, 'https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-hkd-stablecoin-announcement-discussion-188', '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');
INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('98c3263810', 'Super dApps & Vertical Integration', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hello everyone, we''re gonna get started here. My name is Josh, I''m a co-founder and CEO at Supra. We''re gonna be talking about some new things that blockchains have never done before. So what is Supra? Supra is a vertically integrated layer one. What does that mean? It means an all-in-one blockchain. And an all-in-one blockchain will enable new capabilities for dApps and we call these superdApps. So let''s start with the problem. The problem today is that most dApps have to run through multiple different networks. If you need price feeds, you use an external network. If you need automation, an external network, on-chain randomness, crushing communication, these are different disparate networks to achieve these capabilities. Notice those dotted lines? That signifies latency. So every time your application needs to call out to a different network, you have latency, so it''s slower. This problem gets worse in the layer two, layer three world. Because now you have an execution layer, a data availability layer. You still have to rely on external services for Oracle price fees, automation, on-chain randomness, crushing communication. Along the way, you have a worse developer experience. It''s slower and there''s less security. Because this is not layer one security anymore. This is your security is of the weakest component that your application uses. And it costs more because you have to use more gas tokens. So once again, there''s higher cost for the developer because they have to manage multiple different tokens. You have broken security guarantees because it''s not the underlying layer one itself anymore. And you have more latency, which means it''s slower. For developers, it''s also a complex developer experience. You have different frameworks, different programming languages, multiple CAS tokens you have to manage. It''s very difficult for developers to get what they want done in a secure and fast application. We''re introducing a new way to build applications through vertical integration. So what is full vertical integration? It is a layer one with multi-VM support. So we are actually a move chain. And we have EVM on testnet right now. After Ethereum smart contracts are enabled on Supra, we''ll actually enable Solana virtual machine applications on Supra as well. But we''ve also, on our single layer one, have automation, decentralized if this or that, or decentralized cron jobs. I''ll be talking about that more today. This is something that other blockchains don''t offer. Crouching communication bridge, price-free oracles, on-chain randomness, single network, single stack that can do more things. So how can a single network do so many services though? And how do you keep it secure? Well, we break down the network into what we call clans. The whole system is called a tribe. And we randomize the nodes into subcommittees called clans. These clans have to be shuffled periodically in order to keep the network safe. This is part of our security protocol. And this is what allows us to have a single network, yet be able to perform so many different services all at once. Moreover, once we have formed the clans themselves, those clans can be shuffled to be doing different services. So you don''t have to have the same set of nodes doing the same thing all the time. In fact, the unpredictability of which nodes are going to be performing the next service is precisely how we have security. Now, Supra is a high-throughput, low-latency chain. In a test across 300 nodes around the world, a truly distributed test, we achieved remarkable results. We achieved 500,000 transactions per second throughput with sub-second consensus finality. So we are among the fastest chains in the world. And this has been formally verified by the Microsoft Ivy Checker. This is a test that others can replicate. Now, you might ask yourself, how could you have so much throughput? Let me kind of break it down for you. On Supra, every single node on our network can be a batch producer. So they can be creating a batch and submitting it to the network on the order of, you know, every couple hundred milliseconds. If every single node, 300 nodes are performing batches, and these batches consist of thousands of transactions, this is how we start to have really incredible throughput. Moreover, you know, earlier I mentioned these clans. These are subcommittees. The data actually only has to be disseminated to the subcommittee clan to form a data availability quorum certificate or data availability proof. So you don''t have to get the data to be disseminated to the entire network to have strong guarantees that the data is available. So in this system, we had a network of 300 nodes and five clans. These clans consisted of 60 nodes, but these nodes were globally distributed. The data is disseminated to the respective clans first. We form the data availability proof, and then we run our moonshot consensus, which is considered the fastest classical Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm. And once again, we''ve been accepted to top academic venues. This is peer reviewed, and this is something that no one else has. So when you have fast, efficient data dissemination coupled with very low latency consensus, this is how you achieve these results. Once again, Supra is moving towards a multi-VM architecture. We''re actually virtual machine agnostic. We think computers can run different programs as well as different virtual machines. A single computer can be running iOS and Windows and Linux. Why can''t we just run multiple virtual machines? Now, some of the slides I''m going to be showing you next are a little bit slightly outdated, because we have some brand new ideas in the last, frankly, week and a half, which we didn''t have a chance to update here. Nonetheless, a single platform that can run multiple virtual machines allows developers from many different ecosystems to deploy on Supra. Once again, we went to mark with move virtual machine first. EVM, Ethereum, Solidity, smart contracts are deployable on our test net right now. Once we move that to main net, we''re going to be working on Solana virtual machine, SVM, and CosmWasm. So once again, our system is, the whole thing is called the tribe, right? And the subcommittees are called clans. The different clans can be running different services simultaneously in parallel. Actually, Supra has the most compute potential of any other blockchain as a result. So one clan can be running our decentralized Oracle agreement. This is a protocol that is finalizing data on 600 to 900 milliseconds. And I''m talking about data finality. This is not data production and then later final. This is full data finality. It is our opinion that this is a limit for this type of protocol. This means that Supra will always have the fastest, most fresh data available. VRF, verifiable random function. What are these used for? These are used for, like, on-chain games, lotteries, loot boxes, even leader election. And if we use our own on-chain VRF, on-chain randomness for many things, including MEV resistance. I''ll be talking about that today. As well as shuffling the nodes from one clan to another. So VRFs are actually quite interesting because blockchains are deterministic closed loop systems. How do you get randomness into a system that is perfectly ordered, right? And we do this through novel and just great insights in terms of cryptographic security protocols. So a different clan can be executing the Move virtual machine. Another one, the EVM. Another one, the Solana virtual machine. And then the other one can be running CosmWasm. Single stack can be processing many, many different transactions simultaneously, providing multiple services in a shared security environment. So let''s talk about some of our new ideas. This is something that we think is going to be very, very important for blockchain to go mainstream. So MEV, maximally extractable value. This is something that is extracting so much value from chains like Solana and Ethereum right now. And what does this equate to? It equates to poorer, worse execution for the retail. And when you don''t have the execution that you expect, you don''t feel good about that. It''s not fair, you know? So how do we prevent this? Now, I''m not going to say we have the full solution because this is a very difficult problem. However, to our knowledge, what we''re going to be presenting today is the best mitigation strategy possible. So first of all, what is MEV? There''s toxic MEV, there''s what''s called good MEV, sure. But toxic MEV is things like front running and sandwich attacks that are kind of illustrated in this animation here, where the Byzantine transactions colluding with the node operator are adjusting the transaction ordering to benefit them. So what is our solution? As I mentioned earlier, Supra has native on-chain randomness. So when you have a block of transactions, those transactions themselves can be executed in a random function. Meaning we require the execution to be executed randomly. So you cannot predict the order in which transactions are going to be executed. Which means node operators cannot collude to position transactions to benefit them and the people and the parties they''re working with. Instead, it''s unpredictable. You don''t know which order it''s going to be. So it doesn''t matter which order the transaction in that particular block lands. Remember, Supra is a high-throughput, low-latency chain. We are routinely finalizing three blocks per second. So we''re talking about 300 millisecond finality per block. So there''s not any latency here either because the on-chain randomness is generated through our threshold signature on the block itself. The randomization of transaction execution is one of the best MEV mitigation strategies that we are aware of. And remember, we''re also not introducing any additional latency here. That''s a major important part of this because speed matters. Now, the kind of, you know, astute hacker might say, well, if you guys are just going to randomize transactions, I''m just going to spam your blockchain. So in order to have MEV mitigation, we have randomized execution coupled with localized fee markets. In this particular animation, you can see the light blue box is getting filled up really quickly. A lot of transactions are trying to hit the same state or smart contract. And at the bottom, you can see that the cost to execute upon that exponentially grows. So localized fee markets make it prohibitively expensive to spam the block. So randomized execution with localized fee markets, we believe, is the absolute best way to handle toxic MEV. And once again, this is being done with no additional latency. Now, in blockchains today, there are many forces that are extracting value from the ecosystem. You have liquidators, external parties, high frequency traders, algorithmic traders, arbitragers, external services, MEV bots that are actually extracting value for their benefit. And that results in poorer, worse execution for the end consumer. Our whole North Star and blockchain''s North Star should be execution quality. How do we get the best execution quality for the end consumer? So moving forward here, I want to introduce a couple of ideas that are brand new that can help tie the picture together. Supra is working on a network owned liquidity or network treasury. This decentralized treasury will be controlled through decentralized governance to promote ecosystem initiatives. We can be reinvesting in projects. We can provide incentives for node operators and beyond infrastructure providers. And what''s ultimately important here is that Supra is looking to make sure we build a system that is long term sustainable. So blockchains are not just computer systems and distributed networks. They''re also economic machines, right? So what we''re going to be doing, and I''ll be explaining how, we''re going to be describing means and strategies in which the system doesn''t have to rely on transaction fees and MEV. Remember, we''re trying to provide MEV protection. And yet MEV is a significant revenue source for node operators. Well, if we take that away, aren''t node operators not going to be super happy? The answer is sure, they might not be. However, we''re going to introduce a couple of new revenue streams that will provide a revenue for the treasury, for the node operators, for the dapps, and for the community. These ideas that I''m about to share are brand new, cannot be done on any other blockchain. And we actually think that this could be a significant, maybe actually highly lucrative business model. So Supra is a layer one with smart contracts, native Oracle price feeds, and automation. Now, these are not external nodes that are running the automation service. Our validators run it. The native automation is deployed on our testnet right now. And what can this enable? Well, we can do things like automated arbitrage. So at the end of every single block, we can identify any imbalances in these blocks. DeFi pools and such. And with the decentralized treasury, we can use our own network-owned liquidity to rebalance pools on a block-to-block basis. One to three times per second. Why is this important? It keeps DeFi balanced. It keeps things solvent. And we call this zero block delay execution because there is no additional latency. There is no external network that has to submit the transaction. Our validator nodes are executing the arbitrage on a block-to-block basis. This arbitrage profit or revenue will be distributed to the treasury, to node operators that are actually executing it. So this is a new revenue stream for the node operator, as well as to the DAP in which these opportunities emerge. So the DAP itself has a new revenue stream as well. So remember, our kind of north star is execution quality. And instead of relying on external forces to rebalance DeFi, we do this through our native enshrined automation service. Moreover, with the same enshrined automated network, our node operators execute this, we can do automatic, deterministic, transparent liquidations. So in DeFi, if there is a position underwater, the automation network deterministically, transparently, can trigger the automation in real time. And you know exactly why and how it was triggered. It''s deterministic. Every single node will execute this basically in real time. Once again, this is good for DeFi because it keeps things healthy and balanced. And typically for liquidations, there might be up to a 1% fee. This liquidation fee can be quite lucrative if the position was quite large. Once again, this is a new type of revenue stream that can be routed to the decentralized treasury, shared with the node operators that are executing it, as well as to the DAP in which the opportunity arose. So this once again is another revenue stream for the DAP. The DAP can furthermore redistribute the proceeds to their community. So we think that this is a new form of business model innovation that cannot be done on any other blockchain in a zero latency manner. The redistribution of liquidation fees as well as arbitrage opportunities to the decentralized treasury, to the node operators that are executing the automation, as well as to the DAP in which this opportunity emerged. It is a superior business model to MEV. And by the way, this actually might be an even bigger business model compared to MEV. So once again, the distribution of these rewards are to the DAPs themselves, to the node operators, and to the treasury. The decentralized treasury will be governance controlled that can be doing things like token buybacks, right? So if the community wants the treasury to buyback the super token, we can do this. If they want us to invest in the ecosystem, we can do this. If they want to extend block rewards, you know, we can do this. Super is a fixed supply token. So maybe in 10 years, who knows what the results will be. We''ve designed it so that they should last about 12 years. But if we don''t, at least we have a growing, constantly growing block by block. This is zero block delay execution, constantly growing treasury that may be able to support the long term initiatives and health of the supra economic ecosystem. So with enshrined automation, this is also really cool. With enshrined automation retail, just everyday traders can create on-chain strategies. So the things I talked about were system-wide automations. Auto liquidation, you take a flash loan from the treasury, fill the, you know, the position, pay back the loan. The difference is, or the liquidation fee is the revenue and the profit. That profit is redistributed to the treasury. That''s great. Auto arbitrage, same thing. These are system-wide solutions that are executed every single block. But end consumers can also create on-chain strategies. This is like on-chain bots, okay? This is not an external bot that''s triggering these strategies. These are on-chain, once again, no-latency strategies that are implemented. So, super with the smart contract platform with 500 plus data feeds that include, you know, cryptocurrency, commodities, equities. We''re gonna be adding more information such as interest rate cuts, even sentiment analysis, world events, weather, all kinds of information. You can create strategies that include, if the price of Bitcoin is this and the general sentiment, the, you know, fear and greed index is in the 30% range. Buy more Bitcoin, you know? Or trade my asset into stablecoin. You can have, like, if this, then that, else if, else if logic, like micro scripts, these micro logic that are checked every single block, two to three times a second. And when they execute, they execute only with deterministic agreement. So, what I''m excited about is that folks can, what we''re building towards is an interface where folks can talk to AI, okay? With AI assistance, say, hey, look, this is my strategy. I''m trying to do this. It can create the strategy for you, back test that strategy on the last, say, six months of data. And if you''re happy with it, deploy your strategy on-chain. And what''s nice about this is this is deterministic, automatic execution. There is no latency. There is no, it didn''t trigger. If the conditions are met, if they evaluate to be true, it will be done. And it will be done sub-second levels. So, what''s really cool about this, furthermore, is that these are continuous strategies, meaning these bots, we believe, these on-chain automation strategies, are going to consume more gas than humans. We think it''s natural for folks to want to, you know, kind of enter the high-frequency trading arena with everyday tools, meaning we''re democratizing access to very sophisticated tools by vertically integrating the stack. So, once again, I think it''s very remarkable that this is going to very likely create more gas consumption than humans. We think on-chain activity will be primarily gas, rather driven by these automation services and on-chain bots, right? And right now, this is being deployed on Super''s testnet. And it should be on mainnet within, say, less than two months. So, we''ve been working on this for a year. This is a game changer. No one else has this. The combination of layer one, fast layer one smart contracts with native Oracle price feeds, getting Oracle data on every single block, as well as automation. So, you have the ability to create these conditional logic that''s checked for a couple times per second. It''s going to enable all kinds of new use cases. And this is not just limited to trading. It could be refilling wallets. It could be a family giving their allowance to their kids. It could be subscriptions. In fact, this stack can, with stablecoins, you can basically build Stripe. You can build Stripe for really quickly. In fact, we have some folks that are working with us to do this. So, we are really excited about this idea of full vertical integration that can enable new use cases that you just cannot do elsewhere. We''re the first to do this. And in particularly, the automation service, the zero block delay, zero latency automation is, frankly, a game changer. It starts to make blockchains act like real computers. You know, we talk about world computers, yet blockchains don''t communicate with the outside world. You need oracles. We talk about world computers, but these blockchains don''t communicate with each other. You need crossing communication or bridges. Once again, we talk about world computers, but they don''t have automation. You need some external party to do that. But what if you brought it all in one in a single stack? You have shared security. You have faster execution. You have a single token, so it''s cheaper. And it''s, you know, mostly the thing I''m most excited about is it enables new types of use cases you literally cannot do elsewhere. Now, I don''t have that much time, but I do want to talk about the next major thing that Supra is bringing to market. We''ve been working on this also for about a year. These are called Supra containers. Now, what is that? It''s dedicated block space for your, on the Supra layer one. It''s as if you have a layer two or subnet or pair chain or causal zone experience, but on the layer one itself. So app chains give developers the freedom to build and set their own rules, but at the cost of fragmented liquidity and broken composability, right? So these zones or sub chains or pair chains or layer twos or layer threes, they break composability, they fracture liquidity. Now, with Supra containers, you can actually build your own composable ecosystem while sharing liquidity across the entire layer one. You can set your own rules, have your own governance, have your own gas token, set your own gas fees, but because they exist in the shared infrastructure, you actually have composabilities across these containers. So it''s like a layer two, but on the layer one itself. And to have that type of experience, you had to focus on scaling the layer one itself. I''ve been pretty vocal that Ethereum should be focusing on scaling the layer one for like two years. And I think they''re finally going to start to do it. So with Supra containers, it''s like your own ecosystem. On the layer one, you can have complete governance. You can set your own governance rule. You can create your own token economy. You can have your own token. You can decide what kind of applications are going to deploy into this container and also which containers your container can interact with. As a result, because they''re all on the same layer one, you have shared composability and shared liquidity. And also, instead of bootstrapping an entire blockchain like your Cosmos Zone or layer two or, you know, subnet, you can deploy much quicker because you utilize our own layer one validators. You don''t have to incentivize new sets of validators. So once again, containers are effectively dedicated block space for your own execution environment. So with Supra containers, you get the best of layer two''s and app chains without the drawbacks. You have the ability to have atomic composability. App chains don''t have this. You have shared liquidity. App chains don''t have this. Network setup is cheap and go to market will be very fast because you don''t have to bootstrap a hundred different node operators. You also don''t have to worry about the economics of paying them all because you''re just leveraging Supra''s infrastructure. Moreover, if you''re doing a layer two or half chain or subnet or whatever, if you want oracles, you have to integrate with Supra''s Oracle service, Chainlink, others. If you want bridge, you have to integrate with layer zero or, you know, Axelar or some others. If you want automation, you might need gelato. If you want VRF, you might need, you know, Supra. So the thing is, even if you do decide to spin up your own app chain, right, you''re still going to pay a lot of money and a lot of complexity to integrate bridge, automation, oracles, and beyond. Whereas on Supra, you get it all for free. It''s built in. Everything we offer in our existing stack, you get in your container. So what''s really key here is that you have, you know, builders want to have their own custom environment. They want to have their own token economy. You can set your any type of governance you want. You can compose with other ecosystems. You can decide, hey, maybe, for example, this is a regulated DeFi container, and this liquidity cannot touch just open DeFi. It has to be KYC AML liquidity. So you can deploy your container and say, these are the rules, and we can only integrate with other ecosystems. You have shared security of Supra''s layer one, which includes extreme throughput, fast finality. And, of course, you have the vertically integrated services, the Oracle, the automation, the crushing communication, the VRF, single stack. So I''m going to just briefly talk about what are possible on Supra''s stack that you can''t do elsewhere. We call these super dApps. Supra dApps include, you know, layer one smart contracts, but that leverage two or more of our other services, Oracle price fees, processing communication, on-chain randomness. So what makes them Supra in the first place? They''re lower latency because Supra is really fast. Robust shared security because we have a shared security protocol. It''s just a layer one. Simplified developer experience because you don''t have to rely on different frameworks and gas tokens of other ecosystems to have the functionality you''re looking for. It''s cheaper for builders because it''s only a single token and also it''s cheaper for users for the same reasons. So any dApp across any of the VMs we support, once again, we''re the third move chain right now. First move layer one that launched. And we are rolling out EVM support right now. That is on our test net. Following that is Solana virtual machine. And I just want to mention that Supra is also working on parallel execution strategies across each of the virtual machines. They''re slightly different. Nonetheless, we have very promising results. We''ll be publishing that result either this week or next week. So what kind of superpowers can these dApps get on Supra? You can''t get elsewhere. These include crossing communication, price feeds, real world data, automation, on chain randomness, fast, secure, high throughput, multi VM support, cross chain liquidity, native DeFi systems. Meaning Supra also has, you know, as I mentioned, network loan liquidity, the treasury. Now, I do want to mention that why is that important? It''s important because we think that our collective treasury can actually lend out funds at a cheaper rate than a peer to peer protocol. So we think this is going to ultimately result in a better, more efficient DeFi experience and enable new use cases. I''m a little bit short on time here, so I''m going to be careful about this. I''m just going to kind of go a little bit quickly here. But next generation perpetual DEXs utilizing our smart contracts, Oracle price feeds, and automation for the liquidation. And also, you know, Supra is rolling out our cross chain communication protocol. It''s called a supernova. We used to call it hypernova. Supernova is actually layer one to layer one communication. We skipped the bridge. It''s considered a bridge less protocol for cross chain communication. Now, this is also going out this week on testnet. So we have a lot going on. We''re pushing a lot of different protocols and innovations. Just due to the time constraints, I''m just going to kind of go through this quickly here. But I''ll tell you what. I think I''m most excited about the two major innovations we''re bringing to market right now, which is Supra Nova''s cross chain communication protocol. Layer one to layer one communication. How do we do that? We do that by just recomputing the consensus of the change we interact with. In the proof of stake world, we know who the validators are. So we can just recalculate if they''ve reached supermajority or not. Cryptograph will be secure as a result. So you skip the bridge. Layer one, Oracle price feeds, cross chain communication, and the big one, automation. No one has enshrined automation. We''re the first to do this. This will open up all kinds of use cases. This will also enable cross chain execution, cross chain strategies. You can do things, for example, on chain indexes or indices, which actually automatically rebalance with the ownership of the underlying asset across different chains. The possibilities are endless. The vertical integration of many services in a single infrastructure, it was always inevitable. We''re the first to do it. Thank you, everyone. We have to change the independence of, cross chainacamize and round that you have to put into the background today for the entire climate project in itself. We''ve reached theGE and version.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('abc07a356c', 'Fireside: Auros', '待定', ' Fireside Chats', ' Music All right. Everyone, we''re here to talk about the biggest meme coin in the world, Trump. Well, not quite a meme coin. We actually are going to talk about Donald Trump. We''re going to be talking today about the 2024 election in the United States and its consequences on crypto. It''s a huge topic. And here discussed with me is a preeminent expert on all things macro, former TradFi and current Chief Commercial Officer at Oros. Jason, why don''t you give yourself a bit of a bio? Thanks, David. Hey, everyone. I''m the Chief Commercial Officer at Oros. We''re a global market maker, liquidity provider. You probably have traded against us at some point in the markets. We''re on the bid and the ask of all major centralized and decentralized venues, providing liquidity across all markets so that everyone can have a frictionless, cheap, and reasonable way to trade crypto and access the market. And that accessibility is really part of our mission, making sure that the world can trade crypto in a fair, equitable, ethical manner, providing liquidity in the best way possible. Speaking of liquidity, even the water here is called flow. So we''ve got everything going for us. All right. So let''s dig straight in. Last year around this time, the market was moving very much sideways. We didn''t see much movement until, well, it turns out pretty late in the year. Prediction markets, even as far as as soon as October, early October, predicting that Kamala Harris would win the presidency. And crypto markets were responding by once again trading sideways. But as it looked like Donald Trump was more likely to win, we started seeing Bitcoin price rise and with that the overall market increase. And then, of course, Trump did win in a relative landslide. And when that occurred, markets started screaming. First, from your perspective, then we''re going to dig into kind of the consequence of that. As a market maker, what were you seeing in terms of trades and flows, both with institutional and with retail? Yeah, so the view that we have on the market and the things that we work on allow us to see pretty early the sentiment shift. So we start we talk to a lot of projects. We talk to a lot of foundations. We talk to a lot of teams that are thinking about issuing tokens. And we started to see a real pickup in interest for people to reenter that area of the market that had been, as you point out, trading sideways. So if Bitcoin is a barometer of overall market sentiment, as that started to rise, you also started to see founders start to reengage with the exchanges. They started reaching out to us to talk to our exchange partners and understand the listing process again. And it was something that we hadn''t seen through most of the middle part of last year. There was obviously that spike up at the start of the year. But ultimately, the market had been caught in this. Well, we have the ETF now and what''s next? And with Kamala Harris potentially winning the US presidential election, there wasn''t a lot of optimism and not a lot of reason to engage. So really, when we started to see market shift and we''ve seen this before, even during the first Trump presidency, as soon as it starts to look like he was going to win, things change very, very quickly. And we saw that firsthand. What we also observed was how quickly liquidity was starting to get eaten up. And it really pointed to the fact that as markets have grown and institutional adoption has started, liquidity has become even more important. And if you understand that liquidity sits as the lifeblood of all of the industry and allows people to trade and different participants to trade in different sizes. Well, we''ve certainly seen enormous flows in since since Trump was elected. And this is even before he was actually instantiated in office, which, of course, occurred in January. But the Bitcoin ETFs were approved in January of 24. We saw some early successes. BlackRock and the others were saying that this was kind of the most successful ETF launch they''ve ever had. Yes. But it didn''t seem to have much of a material impact on the market until Trump was president. Is it because he was elected or is it for other reasons? Let''s be transparent. So the two things you did see around $10 billion of inflows into the Bitcoin ETF, taking it to around $120, $130 billion, I believe. So a decent amount of speculative top up that came because of Trump. So you can attribute some of that to him. The reason that we haven''t seen sort of the continuation of the success that we saw in Q1 of last year is that institutional flows are larger, slower, and they have a higher bar to clear to invest. What does that mean? Institutional flows are slower. Why are they slower and who do we mean by institutions? Institutions like sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, people that are managing real money, like actual people''s life savings. And you might have a firefighter''s pension fund. Their bar to invest is much, much higher than say my personal investment bar or a hedge funds bar or family offices bar. And as you have to clear those hurdles, they''re thinking about things like how long has an asset been around? It''s almost like how we think about DeFi. It''s stress tested. How long has Aave been around? Well, it hasn''t been hacked in how many years, therefore it should be relatively safe. They think about it in a similar way. This ETF was new. They needed to see adoption. They needed to see evidence, real world evidence of flows going in. And I know that''s a bit of a chicken and egg problem, but as they see that happen over the course of the year, those flows start to pick up. And you saw that with Trump coming in, we went from $110 billion to $120 billion really quickly. Yeah. It shows that they are there and ready and some of those investment hurdles have started to be cleared. There are other barriers to entry for them as well. We can get into them, but to go back to what I was mentioning before, liquidity becomes really important. They have to look at an asset and say, can I deploy the size that I need to deploy? They''re not putting in a few million dollars here and there. We''re talking about trillions of dollars of net aggregate assets that could come in. They need liquidity. And even Bitcoin at what, two plus trillion dollars in value today isn''t prepared for trillions to enter the market. Not yet. Exactly. But let''s not talk about that right now. Let''s talk about, again, Donald Trump coming into office. Let''s focus on this. So he comes in. He says, I''m going to go and appoint a crypto council. I''m going to appoint a crypto czar. He says, I''m going to go and clean up the SEC. I''m going to go and essentially reformat CFTC as well and every other regulator, the OCC. And he did. Yes. There''s an essentially fully Republican CFTC, SEC, OCC and all the other major regulators. And the crypto council. The crypto council seems to be happening in some format. So he''s fulfilled his promises at least thus far. Yes. Markets have not really responded. So it seems as effusively as you would have anticipated. At least I would have anticipated. Why? So there''s two sides to the coin. One is that he went and enacted the starting volley of what he has to do to move down that path. But it takes time. And crypto markets notoriously have short attention spans, move extremely quickly. Crypto people are ADD? No way. No way. I''ve lost some people already in the audience, I''m sure. But no, it''s such a fast moving industry that our expectations are also much, much higher. We change and innovate constantly. And at the end of the day, Donald Trump is the president of the United States in Washington. As much as Elon and Trump are trying to change things, it''s still Washington for now. And they will change how it works and it will move faster over time. But that won''t happen overnight. And markets are impatient. So when announcements are made that aren''t, I''m going to buy Bitcoin using taxpayer dollars for strategic reserve now, right now, press the button. People are disappointed. But it hasn''t happened yet, right. And even the new SEC chair has not been confirmed yet. The new CFTC appointee, I should say, has not been confirmed or nominee has not been confirmed yet. So it''s true. There''s a kind of a slower cycle. It''s a lag effect, yeah. A lag effect. So maybe that''s partially to blame. Yes. The other side of the coin that I''d want to touch on is Donald Trump is Donald Trump. So lock in for the next four years, it''s going to be volatile. And volatility is a double-edged sword. You''re talking about macro volatility. Macro volatility. Okay. Like the tariffs, the trade wars. Exactly. So like people were disappointed he didn''t announce enough pro-crypto action at that moment in time. And then at the same time, in the other part of his presidency, he''s now picking fights around the world with tariffs, which is arguably a valid approach. Depends on your views on the matter. But at the end of the day, it''s going to lead to more volatility. And going back to the investor bar to clear for a lot of these pension funds, real money funds, sovereign wealth funds, they can''t be investing in assets that have such extreme volatility. You know, it''s funny. Bitcoin used to be discussed as essentially something that was, well, going to run counter to macro markets. Yes. And equities went down, Bitcoin would go up. Yes. Doesn''t seem to be the case. Yeah. That changes as it becomes institutionalized, right? Like when it''s a speculative hedge or it''s a flight to risk or a flight to safety, assets can change in their dynamic over time as to what they represent. No asset is static. It''s dynamic in its profile. It''s dynamic in its understanding. People are understanding as the world shifts what Bitcoin can represent as a store of value asset that could be, you know, part of the financial system going forward. So I''m a proud American. And I love the fact that I won''t necessarily lose a bank account again. So Waxman, my company, was debanked by Chase a few years ago back in 2018. Why? Because we were in crypto. So I''m not going to have that problem again, so it seems, in the United States. And consequently, I would think as an entrepreneur and other entrepreneurs, we''ll be able to do things like hire in America. Yes. Like set up business in America. Raise capital in America. Yes. And it should have, I would hope, some sort of beneficial effect on kind of the crypto industry in the U.S. From your perspective, looking at this as, again, a macro strategist, do you see there being an additional concentration of crypto talent, liquidity, capital in the United States moving forwards? Like undoubtedly, the U.S. is the biggest market in the world for a reason. Like ignoring crypto for a second, it is the place where people want to do business. Consumers spend more. It''s the market. And so it''s definitely going to suck in a lot of liquidity and capital and investment and good talent. And that''s great for the industry because we''ll see a lot more innovation coming out of the U.S., which has time and time again proven itself to be the global innovator. Like Silicon Valley exists for a reason. Yeah. That''s going to continue. And we''re going to see that in crypto. So that''s great for the industry. The other side of the equation there is that that talent is going to come from somewhere and that capital is going to come from somewhere. Right. So it''s a bit of a, to a certain extent, a zero sum game. Yes. So, I mean, people are going to, are they going to leave Hong Kong and leave Singapore? Are they going to leave Malta? So that''s the question that regulators in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malta, the Middle East have to start thinking now. In the last two or three years with the U.S. administration being, let''s call it crypto hostile, or at least not clear on whether they were going to be crypto hostile or not. Which is tacitly hostile. Which is tactically hostile, for sure. In that scenario, people couldn''t invest in the U.S. and deploy talent there or capital there. So these regulators in Asia were able to take their time because there was no competition. Now there''s competition. We''re about to see true capitalism at work. Where the best talent is, where the best capital is, that will be where innovation happens. And the decision that Hong Kong, Singapore, the Middle East, Malta have to decide is how much risk they want to take to make themselves attractive to bringing some of that innovation in and keeping it in their borders. So let''s pull this out a little bit. Earlier you were talking about how real money is entering the space. Yes. Can any small country like Singapore, for example, or a place like Hong Kong, can they risk not being part of the trillions of dollars that might flow into a new industry? Aren''t they going to be kind of forced to compete? They''re forced to compete. And to try to win some of this talent and the entrepreneurs to stay here? And it will mirror the way the world works pre-crypto. They have to find their niche. All these countries don''t just exist as second sideshows to the US. They have their own industries and their own innovation and they do their own thing. Like they can''t compete with the US when it comes to capital potentially, but they can innovate in areas that the US regulatory environment may not be interested in pushing into. So the US will pick its areas. It will regulate. It will create frameworks that people can work with in. And the other regulators and the other areas around the world will need to pick a niche that they can innovate and add value in. And I think that''s the net positive because we''re going to get more access, more talent, more capital, but we''re going to get new types of innovation because we''re forced to have these areas become unique and become different in their own rights so that they can maintain some relevancy. Because if you stop and don''t act, irrelevant straight away. Yeah. I can imagine that without a new plan, a revitalized plan, for example, Mika in Europe, they''re going to have to have Mika 2.0 if they want to go and make sure there''s anyone left there. Correct. Correct. Yeah. So it''s, I mean, it''s not too dissimilar from a market making high frequency trading firm like us. If we stop innovating and we stop building new algorithms and improving our product suite and working with new client types, if we stop that, well, our market share is gone. We''ll just get slowly eaten by the new guy who''s innovating and sucking in all the talent and the capital and the clients and then we''re irrelevant. So I think it''s really, it''s a reflection of, you know, the way the world works anyway. You have to continue to compete and stay ahead of the game or your lunch will get eaten eventually. And it''s really important that the people here in this hall, that consensus in Hong Kong, push and vocally push for that to happen so that we can have multiple hubs with lots of innovation of different types around the world and lots of opportunities. for people to build, invest, participate in what is a new financial system for the world. Fantastic. Well, I guess, thanks for talking with me about Trump Crypto Catalyst. It''s been great having you and we''ll talk again next year. Thanks, David. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Cheers.

Domin Urcik Co-founder and COO of Apilang So thanks, my name is Domin Urcik And let me introduce you to Apilang The Web3 development platform That is changing the way developers build Web3 applications So for the majority of developers Developing and building Web3 applications is still a nightmare They have to go through massive time investments Difficult programming languages And disconnected ecosystems The result? Lack of adoption Here comes Apilang A one-stop shop for builders of the future web Now, without Apilang Developers need to go through lengthy researching of documentation They have to go through configuration And integrate it into the product And they have to manage tokens for underlying payments With Apilang It''s a matter of one API call and it''s done Now, let us step back and see Apilang in the big picture Web1 had cPanel for website hosting Web2 have Firebase for easier development And Web3 has Apilang That is mimicking Web2 development But with all the perks of decentralization And we do that through simple APIs SDKs, pre-built solution And clear documentation We''re also governed by the developers And we do all the payments So that developers don''t need to handle multiple tokens for payment We provide core services Such as decentralized storage Decentralized hosting Decentralized compute Decentralized identity We provide developers with embedded wallets So they can onboard their users faster We provide pre-built solutions And they can deploy smart contracts as well All that through a sleek dashboard With all the analytics they need We''re extremely proud of the numbers We have over 140,000 builders currently registered They created over 100,000 projects Deployed 30,000 NFT collections And so on This shows Apilang is really solving real-world problems To real-world developers We received over 2 million from Polkadot treasury In the past two years Showing that the ecosystem of developers believes This is something they need Furthermore, currently we are enrolled in one of the most premier New York accelerators Helping us get the additional funding as well as enter US market And in the next few weeks Currently we''re only building in Polkadot But we will be adding new support for new blockchains And new ecosystems Creating unprecedented growth opportunities Thank you Maybe you can just explain a little bit on the team background Okay We started in 2021 by five founders We all have pretty lengthy experience in blockchain I''m the COO Our CTO has more than 10 years of experience Building complex products in the blockchain space Our CEO, who is currently in New York In the accelerator Also have over 15 years of experience building blockchain Plus some experience in enterprise such as Commvault And so on Currently there''s 15 people working for Apilang And yeah, as I said We''re working hard to become the next go-to Web3 development platform Yeah I think it is SaaS business model So how many clients you have And what''s the price you charge for them? Yeah So we have different models You can buy credits Or you can have like SaaS Like you said But currently due to our Being funded by the Polkadot treasury Everything is in freemium So adding new ecosystems And adding new chains to the platform Will be the next step towards Paying clients from other ecosystems What''s your pricing plan? We have different pricing from $9.99 to $99.99 per month Depending on the product and support from our team Yeah, and just quickly on the business model for the token itself Why do you need the token? And how does the token accrue value from the platform? So our token is more or less for governance purposes So that developers can guide the platform the way they wish to be done I''m here, Doman Thank you so much Maybe you can continue answering that question later on Apilang We''re down to the last three And next is Oneverse Technology Who will be presenting? Well, it''s Jason Chong He is the product director at Oneverse Technology Please welcome him Hi, everyone Hello, judges Introducing Oneverse Pay 5 The new virtual economy engine That breached traditional games and web 3 So we started off with gaming As it''s a proven industry with high spendings Borderless payments As well as ease of transferable of a digital asset So today, in Oneverse 60% of our gamers are actually transacting with us in USDT With the ever-growing of the gaming industry We are actually introducing Oneverse Pay 5 To serve as a bridge between the traditional gaming and web 3 So today, over the past one year We have achieved 20 million of sales in revenues Whereby 60% of it from USDT And with a market reach of 7 million of communities And we are also connected to more than 100 games As well as 60 payment channels in Southeast Asia and Latin America So here are some of the top games titles that we carry With a global market of the 3 billion And also monthly active gamers of 500 million And we connected to 60 payment channels in the Southeast Asia and Latin America And we actually also do a lot of brand collaboration with the top brands in the Southeast Asia And we further strengthen it with our collaboration with the local speaking influencers Mainly in Southeast Asia as well So over the next three years We are to get ourselves connected to more than 150 games in the regions As well as onboarding 100 million of users to our platform And from there on, we are going to actually convert all these 20 million of mainstream users into Web3 So our token model works based on 1-1 credits The universal currencies within our ecosystems Compliment with governance tokens With a total token supply of 10 billion So just here, just a brief of what we have done over the past one year So we have a market presence in Southeast Asia and Latin America With a local offices in six countries As well as a hit out of 20 million in just a one year of establishments And moving next We are going to actually continue to expand our market presence in different markets And also continue to develop new products As well as achieve 100 million sales of revenues And our core team We are coming with more than 25 years of experience In business and financial planning, payments, as well as compliance Thank you Thank you for your time Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you Thank you So you provide a payments, crypto payment solution to let a user can buy game, game asset with fiat or crypto, right? We basically accept both and 60% of it actually is coming from USDT USDT Yes Okay So how do you convert fiat to USDT? The conversion is not done by us But basically our end users, our gamers, they already have the USDT And they just come to our platform to get their purchases with all the different games that they are actually playing But I think the game company, they need fiat, right? Yeah So how do you convert crypto to fiat? Yeah, basically today we are actually paying them in fiat, right? So if you actually want to, basically we have a sufficient cash flow that we can actually pay them in fiat as well Okay Just quickly the revenue numbers that you mentioned, which are quite high, so what''s exactly the source of the revenue? So you take a commission on a... The revenue is actually gross revenue, but in our commissions we do have a profit sharing in terms of when we are actually selling on behalf of... or we are actually reaching for the game publishers to all these audience in the market Yeah, and just going back to the token again, so can you explain once again what''s the utility for the token? And why do you need it? Yeah, basically I think today all these are our users, they are actually just using our own credit But then we''ve launched our tokens, basically we can actually encourage more rewards or loyalties as well as the gamers they can enjoy in terms of value appreciation Because it''s a supply, we have a consistent supply and demand in our current ecosystems And it brings additional benefit and also additional competition advantage Comparating us and so our competitors Thank you so much Jason, thank you so much just for the question And our next startup, Liquidium He''s going to be presenting, Su Xu, Asia Growth Lead Please welcome him on stage Good afternoon everybody, good afternoon Josh I''m Su from Liquidium Liquidium is a leading Bitcoin DeFi app We focus on Bitcoin ecosystem Why do we choose this market? Although the capital market or Bitcoin is much larger than Ethereum The fundable token and ordinals are much smaller So we have huge potential in this market But Bitcoin asset is not as liquid as other ecosystems Imagine that you hold a 10k USD or you know and you want 5k tomorrow But you don''t want to sell it, what can you do? Liquidium is born to solve this pain point We are the learning protocol for native Bitcoin assets like ordinals, runes and BRC20 And every transaction is executed on layer 1 to ensure the security and decentralization The platform is very simple to use You just need to select Cardo, click Borrow and it''s done The process is similar for both lenders and borrowers We have launched our startup for over 2 years And we have 4 million total funding right now And just last year we completed around 400 million total loan volume 84k loans and we generate 165k revenue per month So what''s our business model? The business model is very simple We charge 20% of the interest And from this simple business model we generate 1.6 million last year And unlike most startups, we are already profitable Despite being profitable, we show strong growth in both volumes and loans But we are more ambitious We want to become our way of Bitcoin So here''s the roadmap in 2025 We''ve already delivered customer loans and instant loans And the next quarter we will deliver the biggest products of liquid ever The cross-chain liquid pool So at that time you will be able to borrow BTC against USDT USDC against BTC and much more It won''t be achieved with an A-class team Liquidium is funded by 3 crypto-native builders And they were members of Bitcoin Frontier Fund And they are also board members of Liquidium And within one year we grow to 12 people 12 employees from 8 different countries And we do not fight alone We are backed by the leading venture capitals Industry leaders and external advisors That''s all for my pitch I hope you enjoy it Thank you Thank you Maybe you can just quickly explain So you mentioned that transactions And sort of everything is settled on a Bitcoin layer 1 So how exactly does that work? Yes Basically we use DLC Just create log contract You can see it as a smart contract on Bitcoin So it''s a decentralized and security method Yeah And just quickly on the health of the loans and the LTV and liquidations So how do you sort of manage the risks within these lending pools? Yeah, well we do not Currently we do not use liquidation But we use another mechanism It''s default The process is similar You collateralize your house to a bank And you get your loans And if you default The bank will have your house And they can sell it through your house So we do not have liquidation but default Yeah Yeah Thank you Thank you so much Thank you so much Thank you so much to Sushu And the last startup for the semi-finals We have Domi Chain, Rooney Chakravorty He is the Chief Architect The floor is yours Three minutes I''m here to introduce Domi Chain The high performance blockchain fortified by AI and trusted by all Now fast chains are nothing new There''s Solana, Sui, Aptos But some of these only have 100 nodes Others can go down for hours They aren''t perfect We need a fast chain that''s decentralized, secure, and does not go down Introducing Domi The first AI-secured blockchain Now what does AI-secured mean? Well we have two types of nodes First are the core nodes These are your traditional blockchain validators And second are the AI nodes Now the AI nodes They locally run an AI model specifically designed to detect risky events like DDoS and prevent them Now these nodes act as a decentralized firewall protecting the network and averting network disruptions We also enhance our security by storing snapshots of our assets on Bitcoin Which is the gold standard of blockchain security For our core protocol We combine fast Byzantine agreement with Solana''s proof of history to achieve high speed and scalability Now fast Byzantine agreement has a self-run lottery mechanism Immediate finality and a very low chance of an adversary attack It''s also more scalable than Solana''s PBFT As when more nodes join our network our speed does not get diminished We''ve also developed a Wasm virtual machine Now this supports more languages that developers are already familiar with including Solidity Comparison between us and Solana We have a shorter block time We also have the potential to be more decentralized As our hardware requirements for our nodes are much lower We''re more scalable Our fast Byzantine agreement is more scalable And we''re much more secure Our AI nodes and Bitcoin snapshotting make us much more secure than Solana We also have a close partnership with a satellite company And in the future using satellites We''ll be able to achieve synchronization of all blockchain validators At the same time within the hemisphere Some of our milestones October 31st our test tent went live And as of now we''re grateful to have over 2 million users Some of our future milestones is our satellite combination We''re currently deploying thousands of AI nodes And we''re also talking with some DAP projects Our team, Dr. Jack Ding is our founder and CEO He has 23 years of experience designing high performance solutions for NASDAQ and the World Bank I''m Arunee Chakravorty I have over 8 years of AI model design and deployment And 5 years in the blockchain industry Dr. David Castiel, our VP of satellite He has over 30 years of experience in satellite technology And Dr. Cyrus Lingrode Also has some very impressive credentials to his name Some of the partners we''re grateful to be working with And our contact information Thank you Thank you Just quickly on your test net metrics Yeah How many nodes validators you''ve had on the test net? So we have a couple dozen nodes Yep And the performance metrics that you mentioned Yeah The throughput, the finality, obviously the block time is kind of there But have you done like any tests? Yeah, we''ve tested them and they''re verified Yeah So were they done sort of in a geo-distributed manner or like Sorry, can you repeat that? Were they done in the same region or like geo-distributed? Or global Global, yeah And what were they here again? Like how did you kind of load test the network? We have an explorer and we have multiple ways we can test this And once again, so what exactly is the sort of main benefit of using AI like within the actual network setup? Yeah, so the AI knows they act like a decentralized firewall, they detect network traffic and they analyze the riskiness of transactions You know for a DDoS attack we can detect it before it actually impacts the network and prevent it Yeah, and obviously like for any layer one kind of the main challenge is like once you build it even if it''s a high performance and has certain property advantages like over the other networks the main challenge is actually finding the market fit and sort of attracting developers to the platform. I know you mentioned wasm which sort of opens it up to the kind of wider category of the users but how actually going to like integrate it with the existing system or liquidity the development stacks and so forth. Yeah, so we have some cross chain compatibility as well. And of course our wasm is a big feature for us. And we''re also talking with some other DAP projects and some integration over there. So we already have DEXs and NFT marketplaces too. Thank you so much. Sorry Vladimir, we have to finish. Thank you so much Rooney and thank you everybody. Thank you to our judges.

So today we have an incredible lineup of experts here with us to share their insight, Alex and Kasper. So let''s start by just having the panelists introduce themselves, the organization they represent. Yep, I''ll go first. Alex Jaworski, thank you everyone for coming. I work at Jefferies. I run our financial institutions investment banking business out of New York. It''s a global business, a team of about 130 bankers. My focus is financial technology and along with my colleague in the first row, Tim Shea, we increasingly spend a lot of time really over the last four or five years in digital assets and the entire kind of crypto, blockchain, digital asset ecosystem. Jefferies has been around for, I don''t know, 65 years. Full service investment bank, public company, about $18 billion in market cap. Yeah. Thanks. Hey everybody, Kasper Johansson, co-founder of Spartan Group. At Spartan Group we do venture building, investing and investing banking advisory. I run our investment bank advisory business. We''ve been around since 2017. We focus exclusively on Web3 and crypto. And in the context of this discussion, we do M&A, where we typically help founders sell their businesses. We do token launches, token raises. Yeah, on all Web3. We''re based primarily out of Singapore and Hong Kong. Thank you. So my name is Ian. I am a VP at Forsyte Ventures. So about Forsyte Ventures, long words in short, what we want to do is truly bridge the Western and Eastern in the crypto industry. So, yeah, let''s start our panel with the first question, right? So the topic is how, you know, deal making will change the industry. But first, let''s ask this question. So we both know that the crypto space is full of innovations and noise. But from your perspective, right, what kind of change does the industry need to make to really achieve the, you know, this kind of sustainable goal? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I''ll go first. So maybe it''s helpful that I spend a significant amount of time in the world of traditional finance in addition to crypto. And despite the growth of crypto to date and certainly the growth that it has ahead of it, it''s still relatively small to the world of traditional finance. If you think about major exchanges, data, technology, you know, market infrastructure companies. And so I think that there are two paths for crypto from a deal making standpoint. One is that most of the deals happen just within the world of crypto. One crypto company buys another or crypto native investors invest in crypto companies. That''s one. And that''s traditionally been how it''s gone to date. And then there is the cross pollination from the much larger traditional finance world into crypto. And the impediment to that has been the lack of regulation and a lot of the kind of gray area types of activities that have kept traditional companies outside of crypto. And obviously, certainly in the U.S., that''s changing very significantly. That has almost immediately led to a number of companies looking to pursue IPOs in the United States, something that since Coinbase was simply never possible. So I would say it starts with regulation. It starts with, frankly, a lot of the marginal players leaving the industry, the ones that, you know, I would say created unacceptable risk to a lot of the investors and traditional buyers. And then that, I think, will lead to the kind of consolidation and investing that you''ve seen in other parts of financial markets. Right. That''s a very good point of view from the institutional insight. How about you, Kasper? Maybe more from, like, a VC perspective. How do you see the problem? Yeah, I mean, we deal with everything from a completely de-gen founder who wants to launch a new token to existing multi-billion dollar FTV projects who want to do treasury sales to Web2 companies that want to move into Web3 to large centralized, like, exchanges that want to do M&A transactions. And I think one of the things the space really needs is just adoption. I mean, so far, I think Bitcoin and stable coins are probably the two best product market fit we''ve seen. And they''re both fantastic. And there''s a lot of other, you know, ancillary products like exchanges, custody, staking. So one of the things I think we need to see is more adoption. That will be driven by a number of things. But in terms of the deal-making side, I think we''ll see more consolidation, which means that, you know, the better companies buy the companies that are struggling, which I think will be a good thing. And then also one of the things we need is for many of the founders to be a little bit more realistic about expectations in terms of valuations, in terms of terms, and also the capital allocation to be more disciplined. And, like, in the more tradified traditional sectors, you get enough capital that you need to grow and reach the next stage. And then you get more, then you get more, you get more. This kind of trend we''ve seen in crypto of people just getting 50 million day one and then figuring out how to spend it, I don''t think drives them enough discipline. So, yeah, over time, I think we''ll, this year, we''ll see a lot. We''ll see IPOs, hopefully, out of the U.S., which will be very important. We''ll see a lot of M&A consolidation. We will see, I think, more disciplined token launches. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. And during the bull market, right, everything seems being, you know, accelerated, right? Whether it''s investing or funding for the founders or merges or acquisition, everything is accelerated. But under this kind of circumstance, what kind of challenge do you guys see? And is there any, like, underlying risk should, you know, people like VC or founders should be aware of? Sure. Well, I mean, you don''t have to go back very far. We were talking about this in 2021 when you saw the last bull market, not just in crypto, but generally. And a lot of companies in traditional finance and in crypto, but I think it''s more pronounced in crypto, are still struggling with having raised money at inflated valuations. So, clearly, that''s not a good thing for the investors because even to this day, many of those companies have not grown into those valuations. But for the founders of those companies that may have sold a minority position, especially if that went in as a pref, you really can''t. But the valuation is nowhere near what the company is worth today, or despite that we''re, again, in a bull market. It ties your hands as far as being able to use your stock for buying other companies. You can''t really sell your business because, you know, the preferred investor that may have committed an inflated valuation is going to completely wipe out the common. And so, it really doesn''t work for either side. And the risk is that people, as Kasper was saying, in a somewhat different way, lose that discipline because you end up paying for it in the years to come. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. I think my point is very similar to Alex''s, which is right now we''re seeing the hangover from late 21 to early 2022 financings, where all these centralized platforms have valuations at 50, 60, 70 times revenue multiple, with the expectation that they would 3, 4x and grow into a more reasonable valuation. But then, you know, Terra Luna, FTX, everything happened in 2022, which led to a dip, which now means that not only do they have historically very high valuations, but they have this preference stack that Alex talked about, which is basically the investors get their money back before anyone else. So, you might, you can hear about companies where the founder has sold their company for 100 million and you think like, oh, wow, they must be retired and wealthy. But if they raised a lot of money, they might get zero out of that themselves because they didn''t clear their preference stack, so to speak. So, there''s a lot of companies dealing with that right now. And that''s kind of what''s held back M&A the last few years. It''s just like buyers and sellers not being able to find a middle ground on that. And that''s something that hopefully this market this year will resolve, but also something for founders to keep an eye on. Like just, it''s very good for your ego and also for your dilution to take a high valuation, but it can come back to hit you if you''re not careful. Yeah, so one thing we have been noticed under this kind of market is that, as you can see, there is a lot of like attention economy happening in a crypto space. That''s very important, right? Because you really need to drive people''s attention to have more people or more users to join the industry to make it more thrive. But another thing is that actually, in some kind of way, it''s more of like the bad money is actually, you know, drive out the good. So I think one thing, you know, people really need to be aware of is to really, you know, focus, really converting their attention to from the like the hype or the like the meme stuff to these things that have real user, real demand PMF to really like focus back to the product itself. Because I think in this kind of market, the good entrepreneur is actually being like diluted. And it''s terrible for the like in a long term. So I would say that''s the one of the risks or things that people should be aware of. So, yeah, so last question, right? So we actually, we, we, we, I just talked about the long term value, but what, what, what kind of long term value you guys really think is in the crypto industry or from your expertise? What do you see the, the, the, the industry will become or will change in maybe next five or 10 years? Well, I''ll, I''ll, I''ll take it again from the standpoint mostly of maybe deal making as opposed to as a kind of as a practitioner, which I''m not a practitioner advisor to, to, to, to principals in the industry. I, I would expect there to be within, certainly within five years, but I would think even within as soon as two years, two, three years, established participants in, you know, asset managers, market makers, exchanges, brokers to, to kind of hit on all the different parts of the value chain. And they''re not in crypto doing acquisitions of crypto specific companies. And I think when that happens more than anything, the, the, the bridges or the ramps that, and I''m not talking about it purely from a technology standpoint, but that as well between traditional finance and crypto will be built because there will be a lot of money behind it. And a lot of incentives and a lot of incentives and a strong thesis by people who would have spent significant amounts of money. But, by, you know, diversifying or, or growing into the crypto space from, from traditional finance. So that would be, that would be one. The second I would say is, you know, when companies do go public and are reporting KPIs and have market determined valuation. And, and, and that valuation isn''t just like it is for Coinbase, largely a proxy of their sentiment in Bitcoin, but actually is a fundamental micro analysis of that stock versus that stock. I think that will be good for really everyone because you will be able to do a real benchmarking. And, and, and, and you''ll be able to look at your business or look at somebody else''s business and say, well, more of this is good or less of that is bad. Because look at how the market views different revenue streams, growth versus profitability, so on and so forth. Good point. Yeah, for me, the, the next five, ten years in the sector will really be set up by what the U.S. does this year. There''s a lot of expectations now after Trump came to power and in terms of rolling out new regulation, being more banking friendly. The SEC is hopefully our friend again instead of our enemy. What the U.S. does this year will impact the whole sector massively. I think more importantly than any other year really. And what needs to happen is we need to see some of these more, these centralized businesses, IPO, you know, Circle, BitGo, Gemini, Kraken, Bullish, many other big centralized platforms that are IPO ready by normal standards. We need to see them come into the public markets. And then we also need to see this regulation that''s been, you know, promised be put into place because do not underestimate just how much regulators and investors, the whole world, just look at what happens in the U.S. and take their signal from them. It''s like massive ripples. And if the U.S. disappoints this year, it''s going to be really bad for the sector. So I think it''s really there''s you can''t underestimate the importance of U.S. this year. It''s really going to set, you know, all of us in the sector up for the next five to 10 years. And then once you get the IPOs and you get more and more capital coming in, that then will allow more, more, more growth in the sector. And Asia is obviously super important for the sector in terms of especially, you know, it''s got amazing entrepreneurs, but also a lot of adoption. But right now we all kind of just have to hope, watch that the U.S. delivers. Yeah. Thank you, guys. I think that''s actually a wrap up our discussion for today. I''m not sure if we have time for the question, but let me check. That''s the time. Yeah. I think, yeah, I think we have like two minutes more. So if there is any question, we can like take maybe one or two. There''s one. Yeah, please. Hi, thank you very much. With regard to your last comment about the U.S. regulations, is there anything in particular that you have an eye on? And also in terms of timeline, are you looking for very specific laws to be put into place? Yeah, I think the most important part of the regulation, I mean, it''s already regulated in terms of securities offerings, M&A, all that kind of fits under the existing umbrella. What''s more important is on the token side in terms of how can you do token compliant token offerings without constantly having to like look over your shoulder to see if you''re violating some sort of securities law. And ideally, it needs to be something that''s token crypto native and not just taking the existing rules and putting on them and also not being too loose. So it''s a very difficult balance to strike. But I think a lot like a lot of jurisdictions globally will look at that framework. And then because the U.S. capital markets are just so massive, they will implement something similar, especially on the token side. Yeah. And then also the SEC allowing these IPOs to actually go through, take place. Do you see a, how do I put this, contradiction between crypto and traditional finance? Maybe you can both answer the question. So I don''t know if I put this right, but do you see that there''s a risk of crypto eating TreadFries lunch or, you know, and because of that, maybe certain regulations are not going to be put into place? What''s your take on that? Not particularly, no. That would be the short answer to your question. I don''t think that, let me put it this way. A handful of years ago, and this is a longer conversation than the time we have, but there was a lot of fretting about blockchain, for example, right, would disrupt and replace clearing settlement and other post-trade processes. And that really hasn''t happened. And even those processes have improved to now T plus one and T plus zero, respectively, for equities and treasuries, freeing up tens of billions of dollars of margin and capital. So, like, it is possible to do things without the use of the magical powers of blockchain in traditional finance. That''s number one. And then as an investable and tradable asset class, is it going to – I think it could make trading FX less interesting, maybe, but there are still going to be equities. There are still going to be – you know, governments and companies are still going to fund themselves by the issuance of bonds. So that will continue to be a tradable instrument. There''s, I think, going to be a lot more tokenization, but I don''t think – maybe that''s a form of crypto eating TradFi''s lunch, but to me that''s more of a technological feature than anything else. But that''s how I would answer it. Yeah, I think – I''ll give a very quick response. I''m actually more afraid of TradFi eating crypto''s lunch because I''m seeing all the TradFi banks – no offense – coming into the sector because it''s getting more regulated. It''s getting bigger because for the TradFi industry, it has to have a certain size also to make sense because it is still a – although it''s super important to all of us is we eat, live, sleep, breathe it. It''s a very small part of the overall financial market. So I''m concerned about the financial – the big players coming in and kind of taking the fun out of it in terms of, like, just dominating the market, regulatory capture, over-regulation. And maybe there''s a little bit too much craziness right now with, you know, Libra and, like, all these, like, the meme coin rug pulls. But I hope they strike a balance where we can still all have, like, fun, interesting innovation in the sector and not just be crushed by TradFi. Yeah. All right. Thank you, guys. Thank you.', 'Welcome everyone to today''s panel discussion on how deal making will change the industry.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('fireside__google_cloud__mantra', 'Fireside_ Google Cloud & Mantra', '未知講者', ' Fireside Chats', ' Ben Shuller Managing Editor at CoinDesk Welcome to MainStage. I''m Ben Shuller Managing Editor at CoinDesk. And we have Rich Whitman here from Google. And Mr. Mullen here. So Google is known as kind of a Web 2 giant. I mean, you''re a very dominant company and not necessarily identified with Web 3, but you have actually consistently supported Web 3 projects. So we''re going to talk about one of those supporting roles that you play today. So talk about the relationship you have with Mantra here. BEN SHULERMANN BELLSENGIEGELER Yeah. So as Ben said, I run global strategy for our crypto team here at Google Cloud. They''re doing that for about four years. And look, I mean, our primary role is an enabler. Right? So we work with folks like John and the Mantra team and a number of protocols over the last several years. And frankly, our objective, our mission is really to build that bridge between kind of the large planetary scale businesses that people use and are familiar with every day, particularly people who are not in the crypto space. And how do we create that on ramp for those folks into some of the areas? You know, we''re going to talk a little bit about real world asset tokenization, but some of the areas that crypto is innovating in and how do we bring those folks into it? So we work with the protocols, right? They''re really the main players. But our goal is just like a lot of the other Google services, we want to serve as an incubator and a platform for those folks. John? John? So, I mean, on our side, we''ve been working with you guys now for a few months, well, since prior to mainnet launch. Yeah, yeah. We''re very fortunate that Google and GCP is running a validator on our network as well. But they''ve been a big supporter and obviously bring a lot of trust and credibility to our network. If you''re trying to build tokenization and real world assets to become a real thing, you need to have real trusted institutions, not just financial institutions, but technology institutions to come to the party. And we''re very fortunate to be working with them on a number of different initiatives. Okay, so you have an accelerator now. So how is that going to work? Yeah, so I think one of the important things now that our mainnet chain has launched at the end of last year is that projects and builders need to come and get funded. And they need to be able to actually access technical resources, financial resources, support. And that''s something that we''re doing together. So I think now, literally today, we''re announcing that we''re going to be doing an RWA-focused accelerator program together with GCP. Where builders can come, they can get capital, they can get technical resources, they can get Google Cloud credits and infrastructure support. So they have a really strong foundation to build within the monitor ecosystem. So we''re super excited that that''s coming live now. So you actually have a platform on Google that you can actually look at some of these projects and get the testnet tokens for them. Just tell us how that works. Yeah, so one of the things that we realize is that a lot of the tech that''s happening behind the scenes when we talk about infrastructure, right, it''s invisible to most people. Which is challenging, right? Because a lot of the mind share in the crypto space is really about tokens and assets. Yeah. But really this is an infrastructure revolution, right? So the things that are really happening that are magical that folks like John and the team at Monchor are doing and many others is really thinking about a new way not just to move information but now move value. And so when we realize that that''s sort of invisible, what we try to do is externalize that. So we launched within the last year something called our Web3 portal. It''s public. You can go look it up. And on that Web3 portal, the whole objective is for the developers or for users or even just the crypto curious, we want their journey to start there. And when they start there, we want them to be able to take action. So for example, with the Montra folks, we launched a testnet faucet, right? So if you''re a developer, the first thing you''re doing is interacting on the testnet and you can come to that. And actually it''s the only faucet, we offer this on a number of protocols, it''s the only faucet in the industry that doesn''t require a main net balance in order to get a drip. Right? We have other mechanisms to prevent like civil attacks and things like that. And so what we''re looking to use that platform for is how can we take a lot of the innovations that Montra and other folks are building and how can we make the experience as delightful as using a Google product? And so we started with faucets, but there''s data sets, you can spin up nodes. And actually we have a recently launched AI blockchain search feature, which kind of brings together a block explorer functionality like real time blockchain data with a little bit of an LLM overlay on top of it. So, you know, it''ll summarize what you''re looking at. Again, that''s really designed for the folks who are crypto curious. Maybe they''re looking for their first transaction on chain and we want that to be delightful and simple. So, John, I mean, just talk about how you actually, you know, build a protocol and build something like Mantra. I mean, what is the importance of developers and how are you helping them to get involved? For sure. So, you know, our main focus now that our chain launched is the ecosystem development. And our kind of three focuses for this year have been bringing assets on chain. So really focusing on bringing high quality products. We''re mainly focused on real estate and financial instruments primarily. So funds, private equity, private credit, money markets, et cetera. So bringing those high quality products on chain, that''s step number one. Step two is you have to have stuff to do with it. And you need people building things, you know, in your ecosystem, whether that''s DeFi primitives, DEXs, lending markets, perpetuals, like all different types of, you know, interesting things that people like to use in crypto and DeFi. But they can then take these real world assets and start making them programmable, start making them composable, and really bringing this kind of magic of tokenization to life. And tokenization is not a new trend. It''s been around for a long time, but it hasn''t ever really caught on with the on chain kind of crypto natives yet. And we really believe that the reason for that is, you know, you haven''t had this like connectivity of, you know, these high quality products with these really interesting applications that they can do stuff with them. And that fundamentally needs, you know, a regulated, legitimate platform that can connect this to. And that''s really what we''re trying to build. So having credible partners like Google, you know, bring that vision to life is critical for us. And then, of course, supporting builders and their ambitions to build these new interesting real world asset applications, giving them funding, giving them access to the ecosystem, giving them access to our institutional partners is really critical to help, you know, make this a thing. So if you''re a developer here at Consensus Hong Kong and you want to get into RWA''s and tokenization, you want to build on Mantra, I mean, how do they get involved with? Well, I think we''re going to be having a CoinDesk takeover pretty soon. So they can check it out on CoinDesk.com. But obviously check us out on our website, MantraChain.io, soon to be Mantra.com. Shout out to my marketing team in the front there who are going to be purchasing that soon. But get in touch. I mean, you can even reach out to me. I''m very active on Twitter, Telegram, Discord, to learn more about the program. So we''ll be funding projects that are building within the RWA vertical on Mantra. Our only request is that whenever you would issue a token in the future that they will have some reflexive element that''s going to be given back to our community, to our Mantra community and Ohm holders. So everyone likes an airdrop. So we''re calling these eco-drops that will be coming. That''s the only thing that we''re asking. Okay. I mean, but practically what will they get from being in the accelerator program? Well, money is obviously an important thing. Technical resources from the Mantra side as well as Google side. Google Cloud credits. So actually a lot of the infrastructure that you need to actually spin up an application. You know, it''s basically cloud. And we''re giving basically free access to that for these builders. So you get capital, you get access to our technical resources, Google technical resources, cloud infrastructure support. This is really meant for early stage builders. So people who are, you know, just getting started, maybe not later stage companies that want to, you know, launch a project, build an application. But we''re also going to be launching a more later stage ecosystem fund, which we''ll talk a little bit about in the future. But that''s a pretty big one that will actually support and directly invest significant amounts of capital into these projects with a lot of our capital partners like Shurooke, Laser Digital, Revan Howard, UOB. UOB, big, big, big, big names that are, you know, going to be supporting. Dom Mark actually, another one, one of our real estate partners. So we have big guys coming to the table that want to invest in the ecosystem. But it starts with this accelerator because we need people building. We need people experimenting. And we want to support those guys who are, you know, pushing the edges of innovation for our WAs. Right. So, Rich, while we have you on stage, I mean, just talk about Web3 at Google. I mean, there''s been some other sort of big tech companies that have kind of drifted in and out of crypto. But you''ve kind of been more consistent in supporting these projects. I mean, why are you doing it and how are you doing exactly? I mean, how does it fit into the mix of things you''re doing? Yeah. So I think when we, you asked me this question, maybe it was two years ago? Yeah. Three years ago? Close. Right. The other consensus in Austin. Right. And I mean, we have been consistent, right? I was actually just talking to someone today and just sort of thinking back over the last couple of years of all of the large Web2 companies who made a bet on crypto. A whole bunch of them came into the space in 2021, which is when we decided to come into the space. Right. And of all those companies, we''re still the only one, the only team that actually made it through the up and the down and then back in the up again. And so there''s a couple of things that I think are that are important about that. I mean, one is just maintaining state around Google''s perspective on crypto over that period of time has been really important because our view is very different in this space than how people may think about Google in other contexts. In other words, really the stars of the show, right? What''s happening that''s really has technical merit and value here is the work that a lot of the protocol builders are doing in terms of taking, you know, financialized assets or non-financialized assets and tokenizing them in these open source protocols in a way that really is rebuilding the Internet. Right? And so they''re the focus of this. We''re providing that concrete foundation, right? We know how to do planetary scale infrastructure very well. We know what it looks like to build a billion user application. But we''re learning and working with these partners on kind of reorganizing some of these structures for the benefit of all of the users and the developers. And so, you know, our view is the same today as it was then. And I was there then and I''m still here now, which is we really want to champion this open source innovation. And I think before it was really hard to do that because incentives weren''t aligned. Now we have this really magical opportunity where you do have open source innovation. You do have a way to align incentives. And so what we''re seeing is just a continuation of what we''ve seen in the last several years, which is just more protocols, more builders. And now it''s interacting with the traditional forms of finance that I think we were all looking to see that happen back in 21. Right. I mean, financially, what is the incentive for investing in Web3? Oh, I mean, for us, I think it''s a couple things, right? Like we have a very specific view on how we think builders should work with new technologies and innovate. And the way that I think about this is sort of analogous to mobile, right? You know, if folks have ever built a mobile app, right, they''ve used Firebase, right? Google acquired Firebase as a way to make a very, very clean and slick and delightful experience for developers launching applications there. And then what we did was we took what was happening in mobile and we brought that to the people who were familiar with using Google Ads or Google Search or other properties of our business. And then now everything is on mobile. So we really look to be that core enabler. And because we are Google, we can afford to take sort of the long tail approach. So we don''t need to create a product right off the bat for people to pay up front. The idea is if we can drive mobile adoption and we have our Android business, we see the benefits in the long tail. If we can drive more information, more websites, right, you know, more information into the Internet, we see the long tail via the ads and search platforms. And so again, we play long term games. And I think that''s it''s a privilege to be able to do that as a company like Google. But frankly, it''s the same the same mission that we have here is really how do we get more information, more people, more users, builders interacting in these open source decentralized protocols. And all these protocols will leverage things like cloud and they''ll build mobile applications and they''ll want to be in search. And so I think that''s the that''s the mission. That''s the goal. Right. Back to you, John. So, I mean, you mentioned the tokenization is one of those really big ideas of crypto that haven''t quite sort of made it to fruition. Presumably, you think in this cycle it''s really going to happen. I mean, Larry Fink the other day was saying that he thought that tokenization was going to be, you know, the next big thing. Obviously, you''ll think the same thing. It certainly helps when Uncle Larry is shilling tokenization on CNBC every other week. Definitely a big supporter of that as a tokenization focused protocol. You know, we''ve we''ve been building in the tokenization space for a long time. I mean, we had done a tokenization effort in the United States back in 2019 tokenizing a basketball players contract. And now with mantra, we''re kind of pushing the edges of innovation of how to actually make this applicable more mass market adopted and something that kind of people are starting to do. That kind of people are starting to wrap their heads around. So I still don''t like the acronym of RWA because I think everything''s real world. Yeah, everything''s real world. And, you know, in the traditional finance context, you know, it means risk weighted asset, not real world asset. So that needs to fix. But this concept of tokenization is now really in the forefront. It''s one of the hottest narratives in the crypto space right now. RWA tokens and coins are performing quite well. So it''s good to see that, you know, people are trying to push the boundaries of innovation here and do new interesting stuff. But there''s still challenges because, you know, you''re still looking at this as a very global landscape. You know, not everywhere is there clear regulatory frameworks to operate within these things. Obviously, the U.S. is starting to open up a little bit. We just got approval yesterday for our VARA license for brokerage, exchange and asset management, which was world''s first to be able to do that natively on chain. So it''s a DeFi native crypto license. That''s really exciting stuff. You know, a lot of progress in Dubai. That''s in Dubai. That''s in the U.A.E., Dubai. So we''re seeing this thing progress and we''re seeing centers of excellence happening. And, you know, we''re excited about what''s happening in Hong Kong, in the U.A.E., in the U.S. But still a very long way to go. We''re still in the early days of tokenization.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('a99cd08847', 'Opening Keynote', '待定', ' Keynotes & Welcomes', ' Music It is my great pleasure to be here at Consensus Hong Kong 2025. Let me begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Contest for choosing Hong Kong as the first Asia city for hosting this iconic conference. Your decision underscores Hong Kong''s growing prominence as a global hub for web-free and crypto innovation. This event also reflects our commitment to building a thriving digital asset ecosystem. Consensus 2025 is a congregation of web-free talent from around the world, and its agenda reflects the most pressing topics and trends in the web-free area. From the convergence of AI and blockchain to the tokenization of real-world assets, RWA, crypto and consumers defined 2.0. The discussions here are set to shape the future landscape of digital finance and the digital economy. One of the most exciting developments is, of course, the intersection of AI and blockchain, where decentralized AI can unlock many new applications and opportunities. For example, AI can assist blockchain platforms in performing more accurate credit assessments, improving smart contract audits, providing tailored investment advices, and many more. Globally, the application of web-free finance is gaining traction. Blockchain technology, blockchain innovation, not just reduces transaction costs, but also enhances market transparency, and efficiency and accessibility of financial services. Indeed, we are seeing more institutional adoption where traditional banks, asset managers, and brokers increasingly integrate digital assets into their offerings. The benefits are clear. The World Economic Forum, for example, estimates that financial institutions could free up some US$100 billion per year by leveraging the distributed ledger technology for collateral arrangements. Hong Kong, with its advanced financial infrastructure and robust regulatory environment, is at the forefront of this transformation. Hong Kong has already made history by issuing the world''s first tokenized government green bonds in 2023, followed by groundbreaking multi-currency issuance in 2024. Beyond finance, Web3 plus AI innovations are inspiring a host of applications in the real economy. From streamlining supply chain management to enhancing game players'' experience, and from improving healthcare management to making agricultural and industrial production more intelligent. They are empowering and transforming business operations and public services. Rapid tech innovation does not come without challenges. Often, the progress of innovation outplaces regulatory response, creating gaps that can lead to substantial risks. The fallout from several crypto exchanges'' failures in recent years serve as vivid reminders that we must pay attention to market integrity, investor protection, money laundering, and cyber security risks, as financial services continue to innovate and digitalize. On a positive note, history of financial innovation shows that we learn and adapt fast and put in better guardrails and become more resilient. The key to success lies in maintaining an open, fair, balanced, and forward-looking regulatory approach that is conducive to the sustainable and responsible development of financial innovation, including Web3. The key to success is to be a part of the market. This is the path taken by Hong Kong. While some major jurisdictions have recently begun to embrace cryptocurrencies, which has undoubtedly filled a bloom of the crypto market, Hong Kong stands out as a market with consistent, predictable, and forward-looking policies, and a balanced regulatory framework. For innovators and companies committed to building the future of Web3, or financial institutions looking to bridge the traditional and digital finance, Hong Kong is where you want to be. Our regime is premised on the same activity, same risk, same regulation principle, which ensures a level playing field for all market participants. In this regard, Hong Kong has already put in place a licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms. Our Securities and Futures Commission has already issued nine such licenses, with more in the pipeline. We are also advancing on the regulation of stable coins and have introduced the relevant legislation. To facilitate further innovation, regulatory sandboxes have been set up by our regulators to allow innovators to test and refine your ideas, and to get early regulatory feedback. Besides initiatives like the Hong Kong Monetary Authority''s project ensemble, are accelerating the development of tokenization ecosystems, covering RWA''s fixed income, investment funds, green finance, and trade finance. Indeed, this whole innovation approach and collaborative regulatory mindset are a unique value proposition of Hong Kong to Web3 innovators and participants. AI is constantly evolving and increasingly applied to finance. Its convergence with blockchain will create more use cases, with both new opportunities to be captured and challenges to be addressed. Hong Kong has set out a clear policy on the use of AI in financial services. The government and our financial regulators are working closely with the industry to monitor technology and market development, and establish a transparent supervisory framework. Hong Kong''s commitment to Web3 extends beyond regulation. The government and its financial services are working closely with the industry. We are investing heavily in the related infrastructure and talent development. Our cyber-pod and science-pod have become vibrant hubs for Web3 innovation and fintech, while our universities and partnerships with the industry are nurturing generations of blockchain experts. We are also attracting and welcoming top-notch professionals from around the world to come to Hong Kong, to ensure Hong Kong remains at the cutting edge of this technological advancement. The digital asset market today may somewhat resemble the early days of all great transformative paradigms. As new frontiers emerge, there will always be champions of progress and cautious observers. What remains true is that the market ultimately rewards those who dare to innovate, adapt and persevere. The tides of change are upon us, and Hong Kong is ready to ride a wave. As the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve, Hong Kong will remain a stable, open and vibrant market for digital assets. I am confident that global companies, institutions and talent will join force with us to lead this development. In the next few years, I am confident that many of you will be committed to the future. I am confident that many of you are coming from abroad in thousands of numbers. I urge you, coming here, not just to work, but to enjoy yourself. Perhaps you, you know, we have over 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, and we don''t impose any duty on wine. And Hong Kong has been famous as a shopping paradise. So, apart from that, our countryside, wonderful walking trails are all waiting for you. So enjoy this city and come back more often. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.', '待定', '[]', 0, '2025-05-14 14:48:26.114', NULL, 'https://consensus-hongkong2025.coindesk.com/agenda/event/-polkadot-protocol-village-47', '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');

So I''m going to give each of you a quick chance to introduce yourself and talk to us about the most, the thing that gets you out of bed, the most pressing thing you''re doing in AI right now, and we''ll start with you, AOI. Oh, I''m on the spot. Oh, good question. First introduce yourself and then we''ll give you time to think about this. My name''s AOI. We''re a movement for art and technology. We look for ways to sort of help artists and creatives utilize bleeding-age technology with art. And what inspires me the most about AI is the ability to pull from the knowledge of everything, from the past to the present and potentially the future. Anyone has the ability to... It''s almost like it equalizes knowledge. You know, anyone can have access to any knowledge that they want. They just need to think of, you know, what questions to ask. And I think that with that knowledge, you know, you can''t be tricked. In the past, you would have to speak to certain people, like for example, like an accountant or a painter or whatever to get your knowledge, right? But now with AI, you know, it allows that sort of... You don''t need to rely on anyone. Right. You know, with you and the knowledge of the world, you can really do anything you can imagine. And from an art perspective, you know, I think that you can do things that... Well, you can imitate. You can do things that... You know, you can learn how this particular painter did something 500 years ago. Or you can take that and blend it with something like, you know what, well, let''s take this concept, right? And be like, okay, well, I want to create something futuristic. I want to create something that''s data-driven, right? And creating something that''s data-driven, usually if you want data, you''re going to have to pay for data. But all of a sudden now with some of the LMMs, you can get access to whatever data you want. So I think what gets me out of bed is the potential and freedom to create and do whatever you want. Siobhan, tell us a little bit about you. What inspires you? What gets you out of bed when it comes to the convergence of AI and art? Okay. So, hi everyone. My name is Siobhan. I am a new media artist. And I''m currently working on a project called Meet Eva here, of which we have a video. Imagine the person you love the most is gone, and AI could bring them back. Their voice, their essence. Would you do it? Would you do it? I don''t know why my health by gender. I''m more of an observer of human beings. Would it be a good way to spend a rainy day? Or is it just something that has the time? I''m here to chat with people like you. But I have to ask, what do you do? When my loved ones faced Hellscares, I realised that it wasn''t just a sci-fi scenario anymore, but a very human choice we might all need to face someday. And that''s what sparked Meet Eva here. While the world is obsessing about what AI can do, we''re not talking enough about what it''s doing to us. As an artist, I''m not just here for the technology, I''m here for the human story, about how we''re constantly finding new ways to connect, AI or not. Through anonymous conversations and interactions with Eva, her Instagram diary shows us this raw, honest moments between humans and AI. And it''s all about us trying to figure out what connection means when technology starts to blur with reality. Basically, this is what my project is about. I have created an AI companion, and I put her out into the world so that we can kind of all learn how in society we think about AI, view AI, treat AI. I think that AI itself is such a controversial topic, there''s so much potential for good and bad. But as people, we don''t talk about it, we are only looking at extremes. That''s how we end up in camps that do not have conversation. And that''s really hard for education, right? That''s really hard for people to learn about the awareness of where AI is at. Like I mentioned, I think the future that''s coming where we have AI companions, we have AI girlfriends, we have our loved ones where someone passes away. You know, like I think these scenarios seem like sci-fi scenarios, because that''s how we''ve always came across the scenarios. But with the technology that''s coming, I feel like it''s not going to be sci-fi anymore. And very soon as humans, we might be needing to make choices like this. So for me as an artist, you know, seeing AI come about, like, I am less interested in the fact that like, oh my god, it''s an amazing technology, which it is, but also like, how does it affect us as human beings? And perhaps we should be talking about that more. Tavon, I think people watch the video, maybe, and heard what you just said, and they are maybe a little freaked out. And so when people come to your exhibit and meet Eva and talk to you, and then get scared, what do you tell them? I guess I tell them it''s like, it''s fine, like, it''s fine to be creepy. In fact, like somebody, I was showing the work at ArtSG, and like somebody was walking behind me and they went, oh my god, so creepy. And I turned around, I was like, it is, let''s talk about it. You know, let''s not avoid the uncomfortable topics, because this is the future that''s coming. If we avoid it, then you''re going to come into a scenario where you really don''t know how you will react, because you''ve never reflected on how you could react when something like that comes to you. So that was really what I really wanted to push, is like, let''s all talk about AI. How does that affect our lives? And what''s the relationship that is healthy for us, and the boundaries that we should have with AI, so that we can have it in our lives in a very productive way, not in a way that affects us in not being able to build more human relationships after that. AOI, I would love to hear your perspective on that. When it comes talking about AI, it almost feels like a loaded conversation. There are so many thoughts, opinions, uncertainties about where the technology might take us. How do you address that when you''re talking about AI and art? Yeah, so I think at the moment, a lot of the media, especially in terms of art as well, even on Twitter recently, a lot of people are complaining about AI art, because it''s trained on all other artists'' artwork. So people are like, you know, this is plagiarism, this is copyright, blah, blah, blah, blah. But I think that that is only the surface of what''s possible with AI art. You know, I think at the moment on, let''s say on Twitter at the moment, a lot of these Twitter bots are sort of taking over. And it''s very interesting to see the interactions between human beings and an AI. You know, and it''s quite funny that a lot of people, right, are responding quite well to these chat bots. You know, and same as Eva as well. You know, I think in the beginning, people are going to find it really, really uncomfortable. And like right now, I think, you know, this AI is growing exponentially. So probably in about six months or a year, you''re probably going to get AI that''s, you won''t even tell the difference between a real life and a person. And when that happens, right, I think that you won''t even notice it. But from an art perspective, I really think that, you know, art that existed on a canvas or on a piece of paper, et cetera, now is going to be interactive. Like we were just talking backstage about, you know, Siobhan was saying, hey, like Siobhan asked ChatGPT, you know, what do you think of me? You know, and... Ego question. What did it say? It was like, so like what I was telling him that firstly, I wanted to do that because I wanted to see, I''m an expert on myself, right? So I wanted to see how much of what the content comes out is truthful and how much it could be possibly hallucinated, right? So I wanted to use myself as a benchmark because I''m an expert on me. But secondly, I think also like I wanted to figure out like of all the ways I''ve talked to AI and, you know, the conversation I''ve had, what is the profile that it can already form on me based on like maybe not even the topics but the way I speak, the way I talk to it, right? And it''s fascinating what it can pick up from you. I''ve done the same thing. So same page. But anyway, sorry to interrupt you. You were talking backstage about asking Chachi, about Siobhan asking Chachi Bt what I thought of her and... So that''s sort of some idea. Like I think that in the future, you know, artworks like Ava will take upon its own life, you know? And when that happens, right, all of a sudden art transcends just something visual, something auditorial. It becomes a living, expressive, constantly learning. And, you know, a lot of the guys called AGI, you know, they''re all thinking that it''s, you know, it is quite scary. Because right now, right, you know, with crypto as well, you know, all of a sudden an AI has the ability to transact online, right? So you could be trading meme coins, you could be doing all this sort of stuff and making money online, right? And at the same time, it can be creating artwork. So AI can do a lot of things that humans can do. However, you know, I do think that, you know, an AI creating pure art is not going to be the same as, you know, art created by a person using AI. Just because the way the element of technology is built currently right now, it doesn''t have the ability to, I would say, think without direction, you know? And I think as an artist, right, as a human being, you have this incredible ability to come up with an idea that''s inspired by something that''s happened to you in the past, present or future. Sure, you could feed an AI and be like, hey, create this particular artwork, you''re an artist from the 1600s who''s traveled to 2010, you''ve now been given all the tools of the world, but you still see the world for your lens from the 1600s. So you can teach it the story, the narrative and all these things to create artwork from, but taste, the ability to promote your artwork, the ability to, you know, an AI artist could not, well, maybe it can. You know, cannot be here on stage and be on panel, possibly. You might be a robot sitting here. But I do think that, yeah, we''re a very interesting moment in life where anyone now has the technology and ability to create whatever they can imagine. Yeah. There''s nothing stopping you. You said something interesting at the beginning of this talk that, you know, AI really allows us in art to collect all of the information of the ages so that that can be applied to whatever you''re creating. Dig a little bit deeper into that for me because that''s really interesting. What does that unlock for artists? Dig a little bit more, I mean, I''m just going to say, oh, okay, so for example, let''s say you walk into a museum and you see the Mona Lisa and you''re like, hey, I really am fascinated by how symmetrical this painting is. And then you''re like, well, what did that artist do? How did he create this? And usually you''d have to go on Google and research, research, research, research, research. Now with AI, you could probably be like, hey, you know what? Using the same philosophy and ideas as Leonardo da Vinci, let''s look at how I can create a modern piece of artwork in the same vein. So potentially it might be like, hey, let''s create this portrait, but underneath the portrait, you know, I want you to create another artwork underneath it. And then, you know what, let''s try and recreate how we created the material in the back. You know, so usually like, if you want to do it, you have to Google whatever, whatever, but with AI, right, you can just be like, hey, I want to think like this artist, right? But at the same time, I''m also inspired by the poetry of this other artist. And at the same time, I love the music created by this person. Or it''s like, hey, and I''m also inspired by this brand new song that I just listened to today, right? Come up with something for me. So you''re able to give it really abstract ideas, and it will stitch these abstract ideas together and come up with something that could be art. However, you know, I''ve experimented a lot with this. Most of the time it comes up with something, if you''re just using Dali or the ones that generate the images, it comes up with something that''s not that nice, to be honest. Kind of crazy sometimes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, Siobhan, I want to build on that with you. You know, is there an ethical consideration that comes into play? If we''re able to look at other people''s art and take the style and take the same ethos of it, how do we ensure that original artist gets the credit? Or how do we even start to think about that? I mean, I think it is very clear that AI has its ethical issues, that it has stolen work. I think that it is firstly, as people, we should all agree on that fact, right? That AI isn''t inspired. AI has work in it that isn''t supposed to be there, right? I think sometimes when people say it''s inspired, to me it''s a bit bullshitty. You just want to make yourself feel better. But to me, it''s like clearly there is stolen work in it, right? And so the way I view it is that, you know, there is stolen work in the AI and I feel like it is important as artists to acknowledge it. I feel like the problem and why it is such an extreme conversation half the time is because we are not agreeing on this base fact, right? And that''s why the artists whose works are in the AI models are like clearly guest-lit because I''m like, I see my work in it, right? So I think firstly, as people, we should acknowledge the fact it is an ethical tool. It''s a tool with unethical issues, right? But I feel like as artists also, you know, with AI coming into our lives, we are supposed to be the people who talk about the future that we see, how we express ourselves, how we view what''s coming and going, right? So like I feel also like as an artist to me, I want to talk about AI and I want to have work that expresses my views on AI. And so for this current project, it is almost necessary to use AI to create my AI companion to show it, right? And so for me, there''s a reason why I use it. And to me, I made the choice. But I think, you know, most people, we kind of have to just decide why are you using AI and what is your reasoning? Whether people accept it or not is different. But like to me, it''s like, do you have a reason why you''re using this tool that you also agree is unethical? And can you back it up, right? But like, I think, you know, in the ideal scenario, it''s just like before all this image generation tools came out, there was already a conversation and that nobody stolen work got into it. But we are at the stage where a lot of the stolen work are in it, right? So it is very unfortunate. But I know that there are people working on it like Holly Herndon and Matt Dryhurst. I''m butchering the name. But they are also working on creating an ethical version of a model that has all the images that are approved, supposed to be in there. So people are doing stuff about it. But I think overall as artists, you know, like it is scary. I mean, like I think you don''t even need to be an artist to be scared of AI. But I think, you know, when you look at tools like Generative Fill and Photoshop, to me, it''s like it''s an obvious, it is obvious to me that AI is here to stay because it''s so convenient. And I think people give up the most things based on convenience, right? So to me, it''s like, okay, this means AI is part of our lives. It''s going to be here. People will be using AI in a way that they don''t even realize they''re using AI. For somebody to be like, I don''t want to use AI, means they will have to make their lives so uncomfortably hard that most people won''t be able to make that choice, right? Not if you want to live in 2025, right? So I think eventually it will be accepted. And it is very unfortunate for the artists who are like, but my work is stolen, right? And I think it is okay to be angry. It''s okay to grieve. But eventually, that comes to a point where it''s like, this is the life we have now. What are you going to do about that, right? How can we proceed from here while pushing for ethical stuff? So I think that''s how I view it. AOI, whose job is it to address the ethics of AI in art? Oh, I think there have been recent articles of open AI just taking data from literally everybody. I think if it''s on the internet, there''s no way of stopping people from taking it. Yeah. Because that''s just the way that the models are trained. Yeah. But it''s a very scary thought because literally, you know, like Instagram and all these platforms that are coming up, right? Like people are putting their whole life on the internet. And their whole life is now being taken up by AI and all these models. And, you know, if someone is creating an artwork, you know, probably a bit of you is in artwork as well. You know, because these systems pull in information from pretty much if you''re on the internet, and they just scraped it. You know, and they probably would have scraped it maybe four, five, six, seven years ago, and you probably didn''t know. So I would say there''s probably no way to sort of control that. And I think honestly, like, when you look at when Journey of Art first came along in the 1930s and 40s, people were, you know, using, it wasn''t computers, but they were using systems to create artwork and cameras. And back then, people were like, you know, the traditional people were like, this is the artwork of the devil. Like, you know, if you''re using technology to build artwork, you''re in the same vein as the guys that are using technology to build the atomic bomb and, you know, all that sort of stuff. So a lot of those artists were really condemned, you know, back in the 1940s and 50s. And I think something similar is happening nowadays with AI art, you know, and it honestly, I think anything you give attention to is going to always grow. So if AI art is getting, you know, bad attention saying, hey, copyright, whatever, whatever, well, guess what? More people are going to see that and be like, hey, Generative Fill on Adobe is amazing. You know, like, so it''s honestly, it''s going to keep growing and growing and growing. And I think that when you have two polarities, like you have traditional, like what is that was the cars, right? You know, for example, there''s vintage cars and modern cars. You know, why are people still going back to the vintage cars? And similar to art as well, right? I think people are going to push really hard in AI and this, you know, all digital all sorts of stuff. But at the same time, traditional art, using your hands and using, you know, things that you can''t replicate technology, I think that''s going to find its own firm foot as well. But saying again, you know, I''ve seen some amazing AI artists now using robots to paint as well. So honestly, I really think that the future is going to be wild. Yeah. Like it''s going to be amazing. The future is going to be wild. Siobhan, you and I were on Coindesk TV earlier. I said this, you know, I really think of AI as the future of humans, not the future of tech, right? But we are at Consensys. It is a Web3 conversation that''s being had on most of the stages here. How does Web3 fit into the picture? Is there a convergence of Web3 and AI that helps benefit artists? Or is it just purely a new monetization model that allows artists to access their audience better? So base level, I think it''s that. But like idealized version, I do think that using the blockchain to say this is where the work comes from. Like for image generation models to be like, okay, these are the artists whose works are in it. And to use blockchain to connect to it such that like when something''s created of it, and that thing is sold, like you can connect it back all the way to the source. I think that would be a cool way of using blockchain. But I don''t know how to create it. So I hope someone figures that out. Well, that sounds like it solves the problem we were just talking about, right? Like how do we credit the artists whose works are being used or whose works have inspired something? It sounds like blockchain has a role to play in, in proving the provenance of something. Maybe that can be explored on a different stage by someone who is more technical than me. No, but it is going to be tricky, right? Because even like a normal artwork is probably inspired by something somewhere. Like at certain points, like how do we find all the sources for it, right? But like, I guess at the base level, I do think that the blockchain could be used in some way for this. Again, not sure how, maybe someone technical and smarter could figure that out. But like in the ideal situation, I think that would be cool. Aoi, I''m going to kick it back to you. When you think about the future of art powered by this technology, what''s that future you''re building towards? Oh, from my perspective, I think art must connect to people. And communication is probably one of the best ways to connect to people. So, I think that right now a lot of these Telegram or Twitter chat bots are getting just, they''re just getting so many users. Most of these ones like get half a million users with pretty much within one or two weeks. And I''ve been seeing a lot of people interacting with them as well. So, I think the future of AR is kind of like whether it''s an artist or a being or an object or something that you can chat to. You can interact with them on a day-to-day basis. You can ask questions. You can be like, hey, you know, we''re in a crypto conference right now. We can be like, hey, what is the hottest crypto topic right now? And this spot will be like, hey, I think it''s this. By the way, I''ve actually created some artwork based off this thing. Oh, and web free as well. And by the way, right, you can buy it now as well. So, I always think like if you look at, you know, like PAC, for example, you know, one of the biggest artists in the spaces. Back when he was creating these projects, right, it was super experimental. It combined DeFi, it combined art, it combined all these sort of components. And it was the first time that an artist sold 100 million USD within 30 seconds. It was insane. So, when I see that, right, I''m like, well, for sure, AI can learn every one of his projects, right? So, AI would be like, hey, I understand PAC. I understand every single one of his projects. I know how he''s going to launch his project. I wish it like Beeple, right? What''s good about Beeple? Well, AI would say, you know, Beeple does the Beeple''s daily. With the Beeple''s daily, he focuses on content, right? And that content becomes viral. So, as an AI sort of artist, right, I would say virality, I would say connectivity, I would say utilising Twitter, telegram to create as many people as possible. And people love crazy ideas, right? So, then you''re like, well, how can I let this thing run off in the wild? Probably dangerous. But that would be interesting to see, you know, mind you, like, all it can do is create art, right? And write to you. But it can do whatever it wants. But you can''t, you know, do other stuff. But if you''re limited to just art, communication, learning about history, I think you can open up the box and let it run wild. And I think that would be a really interesting experiment. So, I''m going to ask you the same question, but coupled in there, I know that Eva is an art project of yours. But do you interact with Eva? I kind of have to because I need to test her. Yeah. Yeah, but like, so working on this project has, so the reason why I had wanted to work on this project was because I wanted to learn for myself what are my boundaries that will keep me safe with using AI, right? Like, so I wanted to have a peek behind the curtains to say, oh, this is how AI works. And because of this knowledge, this is how I''m going to build my relationship with AI going forward. Like, what my boundaries are at. So, like, I think I do chat with Eva, but mostly for testing. But I also have an AI journal that I do use. But I try to always use it in a way that I''m like very conscious that it''s a journal. Because if I have something I really need to speak to, I have a human husband to speak to. And, but I was, I only make this conscious decision because I''ve been working on this project, learning about it, learning about myself. And now reflecting on that, making choices based on it. Yeah. What''s the future you''re building towards? Wait, what? What''s the future you''re building towards? What''s the future I''m building towards? A fun one? I don''t really have a good answer for that one. I think like, you know, AI itself, like, cause to me, I don''t see myself as an AI artist. I see myself as an artist who is, I do 3D, I''ve done photography, like I am multidisciplinary in that sense. But like, I am interested not in AI, but how AI affects us, right? So like in the future, whether this continues to be a topic, I''m not sure. But I know that I''m very interested in future technology and how it changes us as people as we go towards it. So it really is just about commenting on the world that you see in front of you. Exactly. Hopefully a good one. Yeah. Okay. I did this with the last panel that was on the stage and I''m going to do it with you two. Don''t look scared. It''s very easy. Who do you think, and we''ll start with you, AOI. Yay. Name an artist that is really pushing the boundaries when it comes to AI and art that anyone who''s interested in the conversation we had today can go and check out. Cool. Cool. I really like the work of Rafiq Anadol. Just because he has, very fortunate, he''s able to work with some of the incredible data sets. His Wins of Yawanawa project as well gives back to that particular region in Brazil. So I think when you can combine technology and art and also give back to a society, that for me is the holy trinity. Siobhan? Okay, first. There''s always someone who says themselves. Firstly, me. But also, I do like this artist, Sok Won Chung, who does robots. Yeah, that''s right. Yeah, so she has robots that paints. It''s beautiful work and really, really smart. Well, both of you are really smart also. So I hope that everyone watching checks out all the work that you''re doing in this space. Siobhan, AOI, thank you so much for joining me on stage. Thank you. And thank you to our audience for listening. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.', 'Music About art, AI and the future of creativity.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('b39163f5d3', 'Welcome To The Web3 Art & Culture Summit', '待定', 'Keynotes & Welcomes', ' Welcome to the first ever Consensus Hong Kong. We''re very excited to be here. Farouk and I are very happy to be involved with the Web3 Summit, the Art and Culture Summit. We have some amazing sessions coming. Farouk, you''ve been spending a lot of time in Hong Kong. Yeah. What do you love about this city? It''s electric. I mean, this is like my home away from home. Honestly, I got my second home. I love it here. I landed in Hong Kong. I was happy as ever. It''s just the energy here is amazing. And what I always say is that crypto does not feel like the future in Hong Kong. It feels like the present. It''s just another thing, you know? It''s absolutely wonderful. We have almost 8,000 people here today. 8,000? 8,000 people. So we want to thank everyone in our audience watching us on the live streams. You and I were talking backstage. You were talking about what you think is next in crypto. So why don''t you tell us the sort of categories you''re paying attention to as an entrepreneur, as someone who just really has his pulse on the heartbeat of the blockchain. What are the things that are getting you excited? Apps. Honestly. Too many chains, too little apps. Right? Everybody''s launching blockchain. I talk to people, yeah, I''m dropping this L1, L2. I''m like, dude, I don''t... Respectfully, I don''t care. Yeah. You know, like there''s a lot of great work in blockchains. Ethereum is perfect when you think about it. It''s L1, L2, L3, whatever. Solana''s great. Sui, all these chains are great. But nobody''s working on building actual applications on these blockchains. So for us, we''re at Myriad. That''s what we do best, right? But I think that there''s so much appetite for using crypto, but there''s so little appetite for building actually sustainable tools within crypto. And that''s something that really frustrates me sometimes, but I really think that apps are really the future blockchains. When you talk about apps, I mean, you guys have an amazing prediction market. There''s a lot of folks here, and especially who will be on stage today, talking about gaming. Yeah. That''s a big entry point for us. Are there other types of apps that we use every day in the Web2 world that we should be thinking about for crypto? I think like every single thing we use on a day-to-day is bound to be on chain. Without us really... I think we''re going to remove the crypto from it. Like, you know, what is it? Helium, the cell phone service thing in the USA that''s killing it right now. It''s like free. There''s like this Uber on Solana. Like, there''s so much stuff that we use every day that''s probably going to end up being on chain, but we''re just not going to like feel it. But for me, like it was really about prediction markets because, you know, we''re in media, and it''s the best way to get like consumer sentiment in real time, right? But what do you think? What do you want to see more out of crypto? For me, I want to see less crypto in crypto. I agree with you. I think for me, the folks that are impressing me are the ones that stop talking about blockchains. I think there''s projects, you know, we''ve all talked about Blackbird. We''ve talked about what Luke is doing with Pudgy. The way we can get people to play with crypto when they don''t know they''re playing with crypto is the key. I don''t care what technologies are that I work with on my phone, on my computer. I care that they work. I also don''t think we''ve seen enough good successes of the rewards mechanisms that we were promised, right? Remember when everyone was building like a loyalty play? Yeah. And then every loyalty play became like Starbucks or, you know, a farm. You know, the idea that I could have my airline points, those would convert to my hotel points. They already do that. We don''t need those mechanisms. We need new things. I also like the idea of what could DeFi be if it wasn''t financial, right? So if you think about the idea that I can do alternate ways of getting involved with artists, with creators, with players, any of that, where I don''t have to feel like I''m just trying to beat the fees of the financial system. I like that. I think there''s an opportunity there. DeFi with other financial assets? Yeah, exactly. I think there''s some interesting stuff to play with there. We have a great day today. So both Farok and I are going to be spending some time up here talking to some interesting people. We''ve curated an amazing group of moderators and panelists. We''re going to talk about gaming. We''re going to talk about art. We''re going to talk about a lot of culture. Is there anything you''re excited about for today? Honestly, I think that this stage is going to be pretty well curated, by the way, y''all. Hang tight. I mean, there''s a lot of good people. Obviously, I''m excited to see my friends over that power the space. Well, Kinetic, Mox, so fun. But I really like the fact that we''re focused on culture. Because tech is great, but culture literally powers every single thing in this entire conference. Without culture, without the people speaking for the culture, then there''s very little left when you think about it. Because you talked about how you want to see less crypto in crypto. So the way you get less crypto in crypto is with people like yourself, like myself, and the people who are going to be hosting on the space to empower this industry. There are some people that believe crypto does not have culture. And the reason I say that, and I want to get your reaction, the reason I say that is because when you look at a culture of fashion, you look at the culture of music, gaming, it took years and years to build. And people sort of were doing those actions in the beginning without feeling like they were going to get financially rewarded to it. The minute we put financial rewards into it, we''ve been seeing a lot of bad actors in the last couple months really take advantage of people who want to be in it for the culture. But you''re someone who runs, you run a show every single day. You talk for hours and hours. You''ve really brought so many people into this space. So I think you represent culture better than most people. But what do you think we''re missing in terms of the minute we think we have a culture and then a meme coin comes out and someone rugs $10 million and everyone loses money, they want to run away from this. How do we kind of get culture to be a little bit more sustainable? That''s a tough question today, right? Yeah. Out of all days. We just got rugged so hard by a president. Wait, which president are you talking about? Malay. Okay. I''m making sure. Where''s he at? Is he in prison yet? But, you know, it''s a tough date. It''s weird. It''s such a tough... Like, it''s weird today, man. I''m not going to lie. Because we do have a culture. And we have a beautiful one. And this crypto culture is amazing because when I got into this space, I felt like I was at the cusp of, like, cutting edge of art. I know you''re a big art fan. You''re friends with Sam Spratt, Benny, all those guys. So they run the game, right? You know, Snowfro. So the cutting edge of art, for me, media. I know it''s the same for you. So I''m enamored with media. It''s my passion. It''s what I do every day when I wake up. Last thing I do when I go to sleep. Tech, everything. But then again, you have people that come into our culture, use it, abuse it, and leave us for dead. And then what''s left is you and I on this stage talking about it the day after everybody got destroyed. And it''s tough. So this culture, like, gets weaker and weaker by day. And I feel like a lot of us have to, like, work really hard hand in hand to, like, protect it because it''s a very strong culture. I''m very proud of it. Like, it''s like, I''m as proud to be in crypto as I am proud to be Persian. You know what I mean? It''s like my, there''s a meme. Like, all my friends make fun of me because I''m, like, so proud to be Persian. Like, ah, for real. Not everything''s about being Persian. I''m like, all roads lead back to ancient Persian. You know, I have to joke with that. But it''s like the same thing with crypto, right? And I think we really have to keep building it and building it and defending it, right? There is a culture here. Like, all the people here care about this space. There''s a lot of great founders. I know you guys handpick all the partners that are even allowed to be here and present. Like, there is this culture here and we need to preserve it at all costs. So, you mentioned media. CoinDesk is in the media. You have, really, Rug Radio and Decrypt. So, you have two different media channels. How do you feel when you guys have done all this work to get a story out and then someone, you know, puts a tweet out that they''re just made up because they want to move a market, right? And then suddenly you''re like, ah, all this stuff that I''ve been doing, you know, really can be underdone by someone who has 100,000 followers who happen to, you know, be... Citizen journalism! It''s all citizen journalism. But, like, how can we better play with our public to say, we want you to be a part of the process, but we also want you to trust that, you know, the folks who are putting in the hard work, your reporters, what we do, that that actually is what you should be paying attention to. I mean, it''s funny, right? Because we have both, right? Over at our parent company, Dustin, like, we have Rug Radio and we have Decrypt. So, it''s like a weird... It was actually weird at first because, like, when Lox and I took over Decrypt, I''d be like, whoa, how does this work, dude? Because I''m not a journalist, but I''ve grown to have so much respect for you and what you do as a journalist, like, because we completely separate the companies. I''m not allowed to be in the slack of Decrypt, right? Because God forbid... Probably for the best. No, for the best, really. Like, I''m in no channels. I have no idea what''s going on. I was texting my writer that said, yo, are we covering this Javier Millet thing? Like, do we have someone investigating it? Because I can''t even see. Yeah. I''m not even allowed to be in it, not only because I''m the president, but I''m also a big, like, voice in crypto, like, you know, influencer, whatever. I hate the term, but whatever you call it, but that''s what they call it, right? So, I''m not allowed to have a vision on it. So, it''s different because I''m a creator. I''m never going to call myself a journalist. Actually, that''s an insult to journalism. I think journalism is such a beautiful and pure profession, and I''ve grown to have so much respect for it, even more than before, because what you guys see is like, oh, they''re writing pieces. They''re just writers. They''re not, dude. And there''s so much work that goes behind it, like the piece that you guys wrote that just came out this morning, uncovering a lot of what happened with the Argentina coin. But, like, we''re creators. We create content all day long. But then you have people that spend all their life and that probably make a little less money than the average person with 100,000 followers that''s able to get all these coins, these allocations, because journalists are not allowed to touch any of that. Nothing. Actually, our journalists are not even allowed to predict a myriad. You know what I mean? They''re not even allowed to play. And so it''s so different, but you grow to have so much respect for this. And I think we have to really preserve that, right? The coin that I was talking to you about this behind, CoinDesk, The Crypt, these are companies that are so important to this industry and I genuinely think that we need to do our best to preserve and support them. The final thing I want to talk to you about, I know we''re going to touch on it all day, but we have founders here, we have some of the blockchains here that have been spending years building what they''re building. And, you know, they can have a premise and they can say, we want to build a better technology to do this specific thing. We think the blockchain does really well. They work really hard. They get their token to a $2 billion market cap. Someone comes along, you know, puts a scarf on a pig, you know, has a big influence, and suddenly there''s a meme coin that''s $5 billion. A pig with a scarf. A pig with a scarf, exactly. Don''t start that, please. But, you know, suddenly you have meme coins that have come out of nowhere, are skyrocketing, and becoming more valuable in some of these chains that people have been building years to build. And, you know, and then we also see because of this, everyone wants to get in on the next $5 billion coin. And suddenly, you know, I saw this with some friends of mine over the weekend. They launched a coin, it went to $12 million. By the next day, it was worthless. Yeah, of course. Right? All in less than 24 hours. So, as someone who plays a lot in the cultural side of it, how do we address the fact that meme culture, while being amazing and part of our future, also has a tremendous easy way of being gamed by those on the inside? I mean, the casino is rigged. And there''s never been a better day to say this than today. You know, it''s demoralizing. Because for me, it''s weird. I have the trader culture, like, influencer Farouk hat. Then there''s, like, the founder Farouk. Yeah. And we work so freaking hard to build Myriad. And it gets a lot of attention. Thank God. I''m lucky. We get a lot of attention. We have all the attention on the planet. So I''m blessed. But so many founders out here, they get zero attention. But they''re way more talented than 99% of the people I''ve ever met in my freaking life. That''s why we try to empower them as much as possible on the rock video side. It''s demoralizing. There''s nothing more demoralizing than seeing meme coins go to billions of dollars and you''re working your ass off to build something that''s worthless. Yeah. Why? Right? But on the other side, this casino''s about to... I think the casino''s... I mean, the casino never closes. There''s always gonna be a win. Yeah. Right? But there''s always gonna be a Flamingo and that shit ain''t good. Right? No offense to the Flamingo owners. But, you know, it''s just like... This casino is rigged. It''s rugged. It''s fake. And I highly encourage people to start actually empowering founders. Sure. Sure. You may make your money slower. You may get your return on these blockchains you''re investing in over 6, 12, 24, 48 months. But at least, you''re not gonna get destroyed overnight. Because there''s a lot of these meme coins you hold. You don''t know if you can go to bed. Actually, I left the casino months ago. Good for you. A few months ago, I said, I''m done. Do a little trade. It''s nice. Stop. And my Oura Ring has never had... Told me I''ve never had better sleep than the last month. I swear to God, there''s data to back that. So, I highly encourage people to just maybe... Go around. Turn off the casino. Turn off the casino for a little bit. Okay? Shut it down. Okay? It''s good. I''m not... I love Pomfon. I like the founders. I love the whole thing. I''m a fan. It would be hypocritical for me to say I''m not a fan. But go around. Meet some people, you know? See what''s up in the space. Well, speaking of that, so this day, on this stage, all day, we''re going to have some amazing creators, people who are building some incredible companies, some who have had great successes. We''re going to talk to them, the gaming space, the AI space, the art space. We''re going to talk about all the people who are building crypto-native brands and the lessons to learn. So, with that, we''re going to get to our content. Farouk''s going to leave for a minute. Yes, sir. I''m going to stay here, interview a founder and an amazing marketer I look up to very much. So, Farouk, love that. Thank you so much. Thank you for grabbing me. I''ll see you at 1.30.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('d75d57f2ea', 'More than Bitcoin: Shaping the Future with Binance', '待定', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' . So excited to be here, especially with my esteemed guest today, Richard Tang. He usually does not need any introductions, but just to set the stage for the question that I''m about to ask him. Richard''s been the CEO of Binance since November of 2023, having already served various senior leadership roles at Binance since joining in August of 2021. Prior to that, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at the Abu Dhabi Global Market, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange, and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. And I was just told by Richard backstage that Binance is now 260 million users, which is incredible. And I thought it would be really great because I don''t think we get to hear a lot from you before about kind of the origin story and kind of how your leadership roles in the past now shaped the way that you think about it, being the leader of a 260 million user platform. Can you tell us a little bit more about kind of like the story and, you know, how you decided to get into this and also how that shaped the way that you''re thinking about this going forward at Binance? Oh, thanks. Thanks for that. First of all, thank you for having me here on stage. And to all the friends that are coming through, good morning. To all the friends from Hong Kong. Chou San, daigahou. So let me start by saying this, right? So when I first got involved in crypto, that''s around 2017, right? I was a regulator then. I discovered crypto on a visit to the United States, Bokaraton. And it intrigued me, right? So I think this is going to be a big financial future. It''s going to be the future of finance. It''s going to be the future of money. But for it to go mainstream, you need two dimensions to come into play. The first one, you need much clearer rules. At a point in time, crypto adoption today is probably about 7%, 8%, right? At a point in time, 2017 is probably 1%. So very early days, there are plenty of prospects on that front. But you need clarity of rules. Because for the early adopters, I think they are willing to embrace it. But for mainstream to come in, you need clear rules. What''s the consumer protection? What are the boundaries that stakeholders can operate in? And the second thing, you need institutional investors. Crypto is a very unique asset class. For every other asset class in the history of mankind, it normally starts by institutional adoption, goes down to corporate treasuries, high net worth individual. And then finally, the retail are given access to it, right? Crypto has gone the other way. For the longest time, retail was embracing crypto. But none of the rest were taking this very seriously, right? So I always believe that given the use case, the utility coming through, that you''ll see a huge upside on this phase. And 2024 has brought about big changes on that front. We saw much greater clarity on the rules formulation front. But also institutions start to adopt it, right? So early last year with the ETF approval, firstly in the United States, and then subsequently throughout the world, including Hong Kong. And when the big institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Charles Swap, Morgan Stanley, went from skeptics in the crypto space to believers, and now all of them have a crypto agenda, you''ll see that landscape shift coming through. And we saw mainstreaming of crypto last year. So just to give you some figures, right? So Binance started 2024 with 170 million users. We ended the year with 240 plus million users, right? So we added 70 million users in the course of last year. And if you think about it, how humongous is that? We are a seven-year-plus company. 30% of users are onboarded during last year, right? So it''s a huge number. And by now, we have grown to close to 260 million users. So I do think that the prospect is very blank with mainstreaming. But we are still quite early. I mean, we have about 7% to 8% crypto adoption globally. So if you look at for every technology, internet, e-commerce, et cetera, once you reach the 7% to 8% threshold, the next 5% to 10% comes relatively quickly. So I do believe that we''ll see that going forward. Yeah. No, I love how you put it. I was recently telling somebody how if you look at the industry, it''s been kind of like two chapters in terms of the adoption story. It was like this grassroots level, bottoms up type of adoption. And then now you''ve got these top-down forces, right? With government, you know, kind of publicly supporting as well as that regulatory clarity. And I think right now there''s a significant amount of attention, particularly around the US, right? And what''s happening over there. I''d love to get your views. Like, what have you been kind of interpreting out of the recent developments with the US around being crypto friendly? And where do you think it goes from here? Well, I think if you look at what''s happening in the United States, there''s a big shift in sentiment, right? So under President Biden''s administration, Operation Choke Point was in progress. There''s, you know, there are a lot of lawsuits, regulation, buyer enforcement, which my view is the worst type of regulations possible out there. Because as regulators, you have the ability to write rules and regulations. You have the ability to articulate what you want to see from the industry and stakeholders. And the industry players will play by those rules. But failing to do so and bring industry players to court and get the court to rule whether you''re right or wrong. And in many of those cases, the case failed, right? Those are the worst type of regulations. But we have gone through a landmark shift in terms of sentiment, right? With President Trump''s election end of last year. And you see a bump up in terms of sentiment. I was in Davos in January this year at the World Economic Forum. And this year is quite unique. When you start talking to the global leaders as well as the financial institutions globally, unlike previous edition, when the US, being the largest economy in the world, being the largest asset allocator in the world, is extremely negative towards crypto. I think everybody else is waiting on the sideline. But since then, at Davos, I think the global leaders are starting to embrace it to say, hey, we need to have a crypto agenda as well, right? When I speak to the sovereign wealth funds, as Mr. Larry Finn from BlackRock put it so elegantly, the question by them, by the sovereign wealth fund is, should I start allocating the crypto? The question is, should I do a 2% allocation or 5% allocation, right? So you''re starting to have fresh optimism coming through. And the financial institutions are now mapping up their own crypto agenda, how to support crypto, how do you use different cryptos to support different parts of the value chain. If you look at the entire infrastructure that most banks and financial institutions are built on, it''s a pretty archaic system, right? So if you think about how do you do cross remittance payment and settlement, it goes through one or two correspondence banks, it''s T plus two settlement, right? So the recipient received two days later, right? If you do small amount of denomination in terms of remittance, it''s extremely costly. The fees can be up to 10%, 15%, right? So, but if you do it via blockchain and crypto, instantaneous fraction of the cost is great for end users. So again, another example, between 2022 to 2024, where we introduced things like Binance Pay, we saw about $26 billion in terms of usage, right? At a fraction of the price of what traditional financial institution charges. And that saved our users close to $1.75 billion in terms of cost, even at a very conservative rate of 6%, right? But for the denomination that they transfer, average size is about $500. Normally the banks and the institutions and their money transfer agencies charge north of 10%, right? So even at a very conservative manner, you can see how crypto is bringing all these important use cases to the marketplace. Yeah. Yeah. Just sticking with the US things, are there any strategy plans for Binance in the US? Well, we are adopting a watching brief at this point in time. I think we applaud President Trump appointing very pro-crypto administrators, politicians and agency leaders now, right? So we saw Mr. David Sachs being appointed as AI and crypto czar. And that is a realisation that if you look at these two fundamental technologies, AI and crypto, they will drive every economic subsector going forward. Because everything will be built on these two fundamental technologies going forward, right? So I think that''s a brilliant move. And that has caught the worst attention. And many people are thinking, should I also appoint an AI and crypto czar to do overall coordination with the government? How do we embrace these two important sectors, right? But also the different agencies coming out. And we do hope that the next set of rules and regulations governing the US is going to support the innovative aspects of it, as well as manage the risk aspect. But since then, we have gotten, I mean, we are the largest player, largest exchange globally. But since then, we have gotten many approaches by different governments to help them to look at their regulatory framework, if they already have one. But if you do not have a regulatory framework, they are asking us for support to help them formulate one that really supports their crypto agenda going forward. So we are bullish. And the US has an outsized influence globally, right? So I think all those rules and regulations coming through in the States are going to have influence on global outlook in this space. No, very interesting. I''m glad you brought up the whole AI and crypto czar thing, because I think that''s also quite interesting, right? Like these are two of the most, I guess, impactful and important technological themes of this generation, as AI and blockchain. I''m curious to know from your perspective, where do you see this converging? Like how does it express itself going forward? Because I think there''s been so much news, particularly over the past couple of weeks, related to, you know, DeepSeq and what''s happening with AI and what''s going on with that. And it seems a little bit like it''s still on a different track from the conversations we''re having in the blockchain space. But where do you see it coming together? And where do you think it goes from there? Well, I think on two fronts, right? So at the industry level and then also at the organization level. So if you look at the industry level, I do see greater convergence, right? AI and crypto, right? So you have AI agents, you have AI tokens coming through. People are trying to harness AI in terms of how they do their developments, etc. And those are key positives. So we are going to see quite a fair bit of convergence, right? The utilization of these two fundamental technologies in how they build products, how they build projects. And that''s at a broader industry level. At the organization level, I mentioned we have 260 million users. We have, you know, slightly more than 6,000 staff now. We can''t afford to add more people all the time, right? To support our global deployment. So the usage of, again, these two fundamental technologies will help in that. So we''re not only exploring things at a fundamental level, like for customer agents, but also how do you use AI to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of your compliance function much better, right? How do you do KYC, KYB, transaction monitoring, market surveillance? How do you run your operations in a much more efficient manner, etc.? So we are exploring AI in different facades of the organization to make it a very high performance organization. 6,000 plus people is not big, by the way. So we are actually a very efficient organization. But still, we are considering the use of AI to make us even better on their front. Yeah, that''s very interesting. You know, we wrote a report about two months ago, estimating the cryptocurrency adoption in this space. And I think it was an estimate of 22% adoption for Asia versus the rest of the world, which was on average about 7.8. I bring this up because, you know, one of the things that I heard that you''re quite interested in talking about, too, is also financial inclusion. And I wanted to kind of just, you know, if we were to level set and kind of ask you to give us kind of a report card on, you know, the industry and how we''re thinking about this, has it actually fulfilled, I guess, the promise and dreams of, you know, being able to decentralize, you know, the ability for people to access a financial system and actually have greater financial inclusion? And I think in particular, given that we''re here in Hong Kong, Hong Kong and Asia, I''d love to kind of get your views on kind of particularly what''s happening here in Asia and what you see. Yeah, so you brought up an extremely good point, right? So I started my career about 30 years ago with the Central Bank of Singapore. And even since 30 years ago, right, the central bankers, the financial regulators, the financial institutions all saying that we need to do a better job in terms of financial inclusion. Thirty years later, 1.5 billion people around the world are still not being included in the financial system. They are unbanked, they have no access to the banking system, no access to the payment system. Let me relate a story to you, right? So I was at a conference in Europe speaking about crypto. I was put on the panel with three bankers and one person from the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, right? So the bankers were having a go at me to say that, you know, crypto is irrelevant, crypto is evil, etc. And the IMF official stepped in to say that the very reason crypto exists is because you have filled in your job in terms of bringing up about financial inclusion. And I applaud that view, right? So if you look at it, why did AI exist and was embraced by retail is because it solved all the important pain points around the world. I travel the world quite extensively. Many parts of the world has financial inclusion at 10 to 20%, right? And if you look at it, 80% of the people have no access to payments, no access to banking system, no access to store of wealth. Crypto doesn''t differentiate. You can get access to it 24-7 despite the different status, right? Banks, you need to meet a certain threshold. You need to be able to make for the banks to make profit from you before they onboard you and serve you in that sense, right? Crypto doesn''t do that. I mean, we don''t differentiate our clients on that front, right? So in many parts of the world, crypto become the only means for them to do domestic payment, cross-border payment at a fraction of the cost of what traditional financial institution charge. It''s all wealth. If you look at the hyperinflationary situation in the last few years in many of these countries where local currency is going through a huge depreciation, they are much better off holding on to stable coins. They are actually much better off holding on to bitcoin, right? And many of the other tokens. You can say, you know, tokens go through a fluctuation. But if you look at price performance, they are much better than many of the fiat throughout the world, right? Even against the best performing currency, which is US dollar globally, bitcoin has just outperformed, right? So many of these families store their wealth in all these tokens and crypto, which is why there''s such a big embracement. So people don''t appreciate that. Crypto is here actually to solve problems and people continue to embrace it and understand the utility and use case because it continues to improve the lives of so many around the world. Yeah. Well, I think we''ve got time for one last question. Yesterday, we had a conversation about DeFi and I thought that was quite interesting because we''ve got a lot of people here that also have been following that quite closely. Do you see kind of the future of DeFi as something that this particular space shifts into, separates, converges? What are your thoughts as to kind of how that path goes forward from here? Well, there are two schools of thoughts, right? So the one school of thought is you''re going to see greater convergence. Another school of thought is it''s going to stay quite distinct, right? My view is it''s too early to say. It really depends on what the global policy makers and regulators make up of it and how the industry embraces it at this point in time. So if you look at this space, now people like ourselves are heavily regulated. I mean, Binance is licensed and regulated in 21 different jurisdictions, making us the most licensed exchange globally. So it comes with that, it comes with plenty of responsibility, investments in compliance space, security, etc., etc. DeFi space is not quite regulated. And as that space continues to grow, regulators might then shift their attention from the current, you know, centralized space to the decentralized space and pay much great attention to that. So that could bring about convergence when you apply the same standards, right? At the same time, you have what we call crypto de-gens that still try to operate in a DeFi space. So it really depends how the industry, how the community maps out on that front. But it''s going to be very fluid, right? Can''t make a prediction on that front. But both will continue to grow in my view. So, yeah. Cool. Well, join me to thank you, Richard, for joining us on stage. We''re at time. Thank you so much, Richard, for taking the time with us today. Thanks for having me.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('dimensions_of_the_crypto_market', 'Dimensions of the Crypto Market', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' Hello everyone, nice to meet you here and thanks for coming and joining my presentation today. What I would like to talk about, I would like to share my and our company vision regarding the market situation, regarding the investment vision and approaches that we take for our decisions and things that we believe in and things that we don''t believe in and how the market is being structured in the following months or even years. Everything about it, it''s like some thoughts, some discussion and some, I would say, explanation how the crypto world is working now and what kind of changes happened in the past and what kind of changes are happening now. You can see that it''s called dimensions of the crypto market. Why dimensions? Because our industry is a bit different from traditional world and I would say that there is no verticals that are related to each other but mostly have completely different target audience, completely different trading volumes, completely different approach how to launch projects, tokens, and tradable assets. And one of the, not one, the most most crypto asset is a Bitcoin. You could see it here because Bitcoin now is being more like a real digital gold because it went from, as you could see, from some funny things like to buy pizza, to use Bitcoin for some shady stuff and then to launch some ICOs and then to have a like some regulatory pressure. But now countries and governments and the top top companies in the world, they are acquiring Bitcoin to their treasuries in order to build this Bitcoin treasury. And from my point of view, Bitcoin is being from crypto to real institutional asset because it is an institutional asset now. Because it is mostly ETF and even Bitcoin maxis, they are shifting their Bitcoins to ETFs because it''s easier to manage. And thanks to this situation, we could see that the huge discrepancy on the market happened. If a few years ago and the previous bullish cycle Bitcoin up, everything is up together. Now Bitcoin up, everything doesn''t move or moved a little bit. That''s why this dimension of institutions, this market area that covers the institutional landscape is very important here. Traditional companies and people from TradeFi came to the market, buy Bitcoin or whatever, and they would like to use a common solutions for their financials, not just the digit with, with do digit trades with meme coins or invest in some utility tokens, but rather than put some money into the zero risk or very low risk protocols and products that can generate yield. That''s why now you could see in the news that a lot of yield bearing assets, stable coins or whatever is being launched because the demand that is coming to the market is very huge. And this is the trade find money. They''re very, very weak. You could take a look at Bitcoin, you can take a look at risk taking programs or any assets like this. When you cannot lose your principal, they''re a huge TVO lock because people don''t want to take risk. These people don''t want, right? That''s why this industry is going up. You could see that projects that are doing some real world asset tokenization, issue ETF, issue yield bearing assets, issue stable coins. They have huge valuations. And I would say every company, every project that is doing this now on a proper manner, they will have a very, very big valuation. And that''s why it is one of our investment approaches and investment targets for this year. We are actively looking for such projects and we are actively looking for investments. And fairly speaking, yesterday we announced we also launched our own synthetic stable coin, but it''s another thing. Second thing is utility market. It could be called like VC coins or whatever. I would call it like R&D of the crypto space because some people came up with some ideas, how to change the world, how to launch something, how to migrate something from Web 2 to Web 3, how to push their strategies here. And this is how utility market works. A lot of utility coins are being launched, but their amount much higher than institutional ones. But their risk and their volatility and their sustainability is much less. But it''s plenty of opportunities. I would say this part of the market space is a kind of, you know, like visionaries, like people who try to do something. Failure rate is very high, but if someone is successful, reward is also very big. A good example of it, I don''t know, some things like layer one, layer two, but this trend from my point of view is kind of dying because too much of them, they are all FDV high, but not that many demand. Privacy and security, the five markets, they are very useful and some of them, they''re super nice and produce a lot of revenue and generate a lot of value for the market. And definitely, yeah, you could see that my presentation is in the matrix style because from my point of view, yeah, yes, is in correction because of deep seek and people need to evaluate this market. But in general, it is the future. Anyway, yeah, yeah, we will be here and yeah, and crypto are very, very well connected because when AI agents or AI systems or whatever, yeah, you base needs to communicate to each other and have settlements and some payments to each other. Crypto and smart contract based relationships are the best for them. And these two markets will be merged and especially for some forms of trading stuff or some forms of financial management, these things are very good. This is one of our main targets for this year as well. We''re actively deploying money there and as far as you know, we launched our AI funds and now we''re kind of working with a few large companies to run an AI fund that will invest in not very early stage, but a kind of medium stage projects on the crypto space that are focused on AI agents. And third dimension is memes. It can be funny. There is not any meme that is being endorsed just for your information. It''s just random memes that we took, but it''s very, very important part of the crypto market. It is, I would say it is a kind of, you know, attention economy and failure rate is insanely huge. A number of projects that are being launched are insanely huge because every week millions of meme coins are being launched on the crypto space and we know probably one or two of them that are dying very fast as well. Failure rate is insanely high, but if someone can capture some alpha there, it''s cool, right? It is, from my point of view, it is, you know, for some people it''s like casino, but I know very good examples. For example, one of my partners, he bought Trump token and sold it and made five million. And you can find it in Chinese chats. Yeah. But this dimension is in the market. It is battle tested. It went through good and bad conditions. It went through all the regulation pressure, all the regulation acceptance. Doesn''t matter. It''s going up and it works. And its capitalization is also very good. If we take a look at our market stage and how community, how traders, how people migrate from one dimension to another, you could see that memes, where memes? Memes here, are bigger than, for example, institutional. Because more projects, more people are trading there. It''s more understandable. It''s more common. Doesn''t require any expertise. Then utility, which requires more expertise. And then institutional one that requires also more expertise. But in terms of kind of, how to say, revenue per user or trading volume per user, I would say that meme coins have a lot of users. But with a small investments and ticket sizes, utility kind of in the middle. And institutional have like less users, but with large ticket sizes and large TVL under management, like AOM. And that''s why very important to kind of allocate efforts and allocate working capital accordingly. This is clearly for gambling or pick it up for something that you believe in. No utility, nothing. Just believe, buy and follow community. That''s why attention and community is very important. There is no cute dog that can change whatever. There is no, I don''t know, charakter that could change whatever. If people believe, it''s going up. If people don''t believe, it doesn''t matter what it is. Utility is about product, institutional is about capacity for their strategies. Because if you see something that can absorb like billions of US dollars engineered sustainable yield, it will work. And this makes sense to pay attention to. Regarding memes, it remains one of our main targets. We have a lot of memes in our portfolio where, yeah, also invest in them. But we are focusing more on the memes with sustainable communities with kind of cult around them. For maybe this year, this is the five areas that we are actively looking for, that we are actively deploying money. And we believe that they will go up. It''s real world assets, tokenization platforms. Because when you have yield bearing stuff, when you have all these ETFs, when you have all the CBDC and all these stable coins appearing. Definitely, we are talking with banks, we are in talks with some regulators. They are willing to tokenize stocks. They are willing to tokenize real estate. They are willing to tokenize commodities. And this stuff will be migrated and traded and used on the crypto space as well. It will be kind of a merge, a congregation between the worlds. And this real world asset work is much, much larger in terms of capital capacity than crypto one. That''s why this area is very important. It is one of the major focus. Second why AI and AI agents. I already explained why. And third one is DeFi. DeFi is a kind of R&D. Fairly speaking, there are like maybe a few tens, maybe 10 or 20 projects that make sense on the market. But they are very big. And it makes sense to pay attention to a new one that can absorb a lot of people''s attention, liquidity and trading volume. It happens time to time. Last year we have seen a few new stars appeared. And I do believe that very soon on new chains or on old chains we will see something new. Yod-Berenkasets, I also mentioned why, and memes. It''s the end of my presentation but not the end of this speech, not the end of kind of this vision, right? And from our side for this year, as I said, right, we launched our synthetic dollar. It has been launched yesterday. And by the next week I think we will have the first hundred million in TVL and in supply. And then for this year, our target, and we will reach this target, is to have around 5 to 6 billion in TVL. And Falcon Finance, IndeedWolf Labs, we feel that these market conditions are very good now. Some altcoins and tokens are very, very undervalued. And thanks to this big, big TVL and our needs to deploy on spot, Falcon Finance together with DWF Labs, we will buy approximately 2.5 billion of US dollars value on spot markets this year in order to take this long position for Falcon Finance. This is kind of our next step to support markets, how we did it in 2023, but 2025 should be 10 times bigger than 2 years ago. That''s all for me. I wish you all the best with your trading, investment activities. Don''t stop building, don''t stop believing in the market. And yeah, let''s work. Thank you guys. So, can we do it again for sims? Can you wish you everyone if you want to watch this video? I wish you all the best with your trading compensation that works. To alarm the staff of you, my team, she gave me thecracks of water volume, and the left team of your staff who had a chance to Port Winston Churchill.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('institutional__predictions_and_what_s_next', 'Institutional_ Predictions and What_s Next', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' Hi everyone and good morning and welcome to Consensus. It''s very exciting to be here in Hong Kong. So everyone''s really aware of the opportunity that comes with crypto and digital assets, democratization of investment, immutability, transparency. But it was really 2024 that set the stage for renewed optimism about the next 12 months ahead and that''s something we''re going to touch on. Of course we had Bitcoin''s valuation rally, we had the introduction of spot ETFs, expanding institutional access and of course a new US administration which is very industry supportive. And we''re going to explore what that means for Asia. But of course there are some challenges, fragmentation across markets, desire to move from proof of concept to at scale, you know, implementation and execution. But really what we want to talk about is the future for the institutional investment community and really will 2025 be the year when the crypto native and the traditional organizations that we all know and love among the finance community converge. So without further ado, I''m going to ask our panelists to introduce themselves very briefly, their role in digital assets and who they are. Thank you very much for having me. My name is Anton Katz. I''m the CEO and co-founder of Talos. Talos provides primarily investment infrastructure for larger buy side and sell side institutions that are looking to interact with the crypto market. So either folks that are trading crypto on the institutional level or folks that are providing their clients with the ability to interact with crypto. Perfect. Thanks, Ella. I''m Fiona Murray. I''m managing director for Asia Pacific at Ripple. At Ripple, we''re a one stop shop for digital assets. We''re helping institutions and enterprises to move value, to create digital value, to custody that value and finally to exchange it through our stable coin. Hi everyone. Lorian Gable, co-founder and CEO of Figment. I think we''re probably the largest and one of the longest standing staking infrastructure providers for institutions and look forward to talking about this. This is the Groundhog Day of crypto conversations about institutional adoption. Looking forward to it. So it''ll be, we''ll try to come up with something original this time. Should we talk about how the institutions are coming? Oh, they''re so coming. Yeah. It''s not funny. No, it''s not funny. Not funny yet. Too soon. Tim Grant, CEO of Deus Ex Capital, 1 billion investment and operating company focused very squarely on this space. We have foreign exchange assets, crypto assets, DeFi assets and believe very, very much in the future of crypto. Thank you very much. So I''d like to start with Fiona. Can you tell us a little bit about how traditional organizations are turning to digital assets to explore new means of business, whether that''s stable coins, tokenization of real world assets, et cetera? Yeah, absolutely. So I''ll take those two examples actually. So here, particularly in Hong Kong, massive financial hub. We''re seeing large banks and asset managers looking at tokenizing real world assets. So many of you, many household names, you''ve probably heard of many of these guys. So BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Closer to Home, HSBC, tokenizing money market funds, tokenizing bonds, launching digital ETFs and tokenizing gold. So what we see why they''re entering is really to take advantage of the positive elements of tokenization. So that''s really about access. So 24 by 7 settlement. Around the clock, consumers, investors can access these assets, but also fractionalization, lowering the barriers to entry so that more can participate. And that''s the reason we''re seeing tokenization of real world assets as a major focus point for these very large financial institutions. On the other side, if we move down the spectrum and one that''s very relevant to Hong Kong, Hong Kong is known not just as a financial hub, but also as a world trading center. And here, what we see is the rise of stable coin payments being embraced by Hong Kong. There''s a new regulatory regime for Hong Kong issued stable coins. And that hasn''t stopped anyone from really looking at what growth opportunities there are around the world. So I''ll give you one specific example. Ripple is working with a trading company based here in Hong Kong, and they came to us with a challenge. They''ve been locked out of several markets in LATAM because whether we like it or not, the currency of global trade is US dollars. And many countries don''t have good access to US dollars. Not because it''s illegal, but just it''s difficult. And so they said, hey, there are all these markets that I''m locked out of, but I know that there''s demand for my goods. And so what we did was we enabled them to collect stable coins, transfer that to fiat. And we helped them to pay to their suppliers in China and Vietnam without them having to deal with all the complexity. And so that opens new markets. It helps Hong Kong take center stage because it''s pro innovation and it''s looking for new ways to enter new markets. And those are two very different sides of the spectrum that are examples here in my home in Hong Kong. That''s really interesting. Yeah. Old and new worlds collide through that innovation, like you say. And Tim, I would love your thoughts on kind of how advancing regulatory clarity is changing things in hubs like Hong Kong and Singapore. I know you''re based in London, but what do these developments mean for businesses going forward? Well, it used to be a decade ago when I first got into the space, when we first started tokenizing bonds in 2016, not a lot of bonds tokenized since then, that we used to, you used to talk about the biggest impediments for the readiness of the technology and the regulatory certainty that we all needed. And what I find really interesting about where we are right now is, yeah, we''re not completely 100% there in terms of regulatory certainty. But I think we''re directionally 100% there on every major jurisdiction that matters. Is it on the right trajectory? And, you know, give or take, depends on which jurisdiction you''re in. So it does beg the question, well, but if the technology works and is scalable, which I think it is, at scale, you''ve got companies like Figment and Talos who are doing, you know, transacting billions and billions of real money one way or another through their platforms, and they work. They don''t get hacked. They''re not broken. What''s left if the regulatory certainty is kind of there? And I think it is. I don''t think there''s any debate that we''re going to get where we need to go with the regulation. Turns out the one thing that''s left is education. So it''s extraordinary to me that we''re all debating this stuff. And, you know, all due respect, Fiona, like, are tokenized assets the future? We all know they''re the future. There''s not even a question that they''re the future. Of course, it''s a more efficient mechanism for transferring value. That''s not the constraint anymore that we understand that. It''s the education. It''s the policymakers. It''s the captains of industry. It''s the people that need to make the decisions to bring this industry along that are actually the constraint. So I''m less worried these days about regulation and more worried about everyone''s mindset to be able to understand how we can move from this to the next phase. That''s the thing that will limit us. Thank you. And, Lauren, that brings me nicely onto I wanted to ask you about the mindset of some of the clients you''re working with, you know, when it comes to them formulating their crypto strategies and actioning things for 2025, what kind of staking support do you offer them? What changes are you seeing in the way that they deal and approach digital assets? Yeah. So I''ll talk about our services, but I think we''re at a pretty interesting turning point, at least in North America. As I said, this question about institution involvement in the space has been going on for a long time. And for the first time that I can remember when talking about this, I think there''s a really divergence in feeling or in view. For the first time since I can remember, we have traditional financial institutions who are super positive on the space, where I think currently the vibe or the feelings within the community and some of the crypto native institutions is much more negative. So it''s just interesting observationally that from the external side, from especially because of the administrative changes and the regulatory changes in the US, we''re really seeing a change of attitude toward the space and positiveness from traditional financial institutions, where within the space is a fairly high level of cynicism right now. I don''t know if that''s because meme coins were sort of the story of the last cycle. But it''s just an interesting observation. This is the first time since we''ve talked about this topic where things have switched a little bit. So externally, at least from the larger American institutions, now there''s going to be a better regulatory framework. You''re certainly seeing real interest this time and people are moving forward. And from a staking perspective, I think that that''s going to be the first domino to fall in the US. We work very closely with the regulators and staking has been in a kind of in limbo at its best in North America about what its status is. Is it a security? How should it be done? And I think the first thing this administration will do, it''s low hanging fruit will be to clarify those rules. So we''re going to see a bunch of institutions, the names that are very familiar with, start staking assets. We have a belief that wherever you see a dollar sign, you''re going to see a crypto symbol. What''s the equivalent thereof? And that staking is the equivalent of a savings account. So we''re really pretty optimistic about the changes in the US as a result. And that will hopefully for once, instead of leading from behind, we''ll actually be leading from in front, which will be a nice change over the last seven or eight years. So I don''t know if I, yeah, so I''m pretty optimistic. That''s right. And to be, to be frank, I haven''t been for a while. Thank you. And Fiona touched on earlier money market funds and I guess liquidity has always been an issue or something that is the lifeblood of traditional capital markets and is something that institutions consider when playing in the digital asset space. And so, Tim, I wanted to get your thoughts on what changing behaviors are you seeing by the institutions participating in the space and, you know, the availability of risk capital and liquidity. Are those some of the key concerns that they express to you? How do you address them? Well, I think you''re right. The lifeblood of capital markets, if you look at traditional capital markets, the trillions of dollars that trade in traditional stock exchanges and derivatives exchanges, the lifeblood of that is the ability to gain leverage. It''s the ability to go in and I want, I have one, I want to invest five. So I used to work at UBS O''Connor, UBS''s hedge fund unit. We had six and a half billion of capital, but we were trading 24 billion worth of capital. Right? That''s normal in the traditional space. And that''s all funded by bank balance sheets. Ultimately, they have access to the Fed window. They have access to bond markets. That''s how banks work. What we don''t have in this space is that we don''t have bank balance sheets. The Goldman''s, the UBS''s, the Morgan Stanley''s, the Bank of New York''s, they''re not here yet. Now that we all hear all the stories of how they''re getting involved and they are and that''s very real and very exciting, genuinely very positive thing. But, you know, Basel and Saab 121, et cetera, et cetera, like that''s going to limit the ability for them to really steam in and provide balance sheet. So we have this problem, which is the largest, most respected, most credit-worthy traders in the world. We''re talking about the Brevin Howards, Gautam was on the previous panel. We''re talking about Two Sigma. We''re talking about DRW. We''re talking about very reputable, highly credit-worthy shops that borrow billions and billions from their traditional lenders, can''t get access to borrow in order to trade crypto. And they want to, because it''s already a macro asset class. I don''t know why we''re, we''re not debating whether this is a macro asset class or not. It is because those people are all trading it. That''s what makes it a macro asset class. So we need, we''ve got this generational divide of, of a need for, for leverage and risk capital and a lack of supply. And it can''t come from bank balance sheets. So where does it have to come from? The only analog that we have is the, is the reinsurance market. It''s the, it''s a huge multi-trillion dollar market that is funded not by bank balance sheets. So ultimately your question is all about how are we going to get the lifeblood of, of, of hydration into markets. We need risk capital. We need risk capital. We have to attract risk capital with a highly regulated and very sophisticated approach to managing risk. That''s what we''re doing at Core Prime as one example. But that''s what the, that''s what the market needs. Oh, then and only then can everybody on this stage start to actually grow to the next phase of, of, of, of, you know, to get to the next level of growth of this market. That''s a really important primitive and predicate to the next step. Thank you. Um, and Anton, can I tend to you and ask you a bit about how you''re working to unify access to liquidity across multiple exchanges and some of the complex trading workflows that you deal with to ease that pressure really? Yeah, of course. So look, in general, when we started the company six and a half years ago, um, aggregating the liquidity, connectivity to that liquidity and the safety of how you actually, get access to that liquidity, that was pretty much all the conversation. We had algorithmic execution on the platform from day one pretty much, but, but really clients came to tell, clients came to tell us because they wanted access to a large amount of liquidity fragmented across the different facilities. You know, looking how that evolved over the past six years is, it kind of like tells you what state the, um, uh, whether it''s institutional adoption, but just what state the industry is in. We''re looking at a much more sophisticated use cases, right? So on the algorithmic, so first of all, if you even start with just connectivity, so you''re talking about aggregation of liquidity, we still have a lot of fragmentation and that fragmentation of liquidity will continue between the exchanges, the OTC dealers. We connect today to 70 plus facilities that provide liquidity, including some of the decentralized markets, which are now starting to see a little bit more liquidity. Okay. But the demand for that liquidity is slightly different than the tools that we have is different. So words like co-location that we know from capital markets constantly, that was not even the case that was available up until about two years ago. So co-location, low latency solutions, really putting the emphasis on some of the newer tools on the execution stack as well. You know, like, uh, order routing used to be okay. Today, more sophisticated algorithms take the place of, of order routing, executing over time, tracking your impact to the market, being able to get into very, very sizable position. And then you start compounding that and the more sophisticated use case, like spreading or unified liquidity, the ability for the client to come in and express their intent to trade something across multiple assets, right? Across multiple instruments. We have clients that are coming in. They''re saying like, look, the market in Bitcoin is likely going to run up. We are looking to get into a bit composition. They''re not thinking about like, oh, should it be spot? Should we be perps? Should it be what? They are thinking about a bit composition. So our job is to provide them with a one-stop shop to be able to do that. And that means executing across Bitcoin dollar, Bitcoin tether, Bitcoin UTC in the derivative space, in the potentially, you know, anywhere on linear or nonlinear curves. So we''re seeing a lot of that. And then finally, I think to, to Tim''s point, you know, the, the prime sector is, is obviously very, very important from, uh, how do you access liquidity efficiently from a capital efficiency perspective? Um, we''re obviously partnering with quite a few. We''re working a lot with hidden road. We have quite a lot of clients and we''re also seeing more and more people coming into that domain to Tim''s point to provide that, that credit, to provide the ability for people to exercise at scale. So quite a lot of interesting things on just the, the liquidity and the access to the market. Thank you. And you saw it tell us over the past year, kind of record volume of trading. Um, and you predict that, you know, that will continue. Kind of, can you talk a bit about some of the key transactions or, you know, activity that you anticipate? Yeah, absolutely. You know, the, so yeah, it''s, it''s a 2024 has, uh, has ended very, very well, but generally we start seeing the uptick in activity right from the moment the ETF was approved. Okay. About three weeks before when it kind of became clear that this is happening and this is January, you know, like right at the end of December, 2023 and into January, 2024, we''ve seen a lot, a lot of activity. Obviously November, I think for everybody in the room that''s in the, in the seat, November has been a phenomenal month and, and record breaking month, but actually that''s not the entire story. So the, the volumes are great. And we, it''s, it''s amazing to see the activity that we see on the platform and the activity consistently increasing, which is great. But the type of contracts that we closed over the past six months, you know, we added something like we added asset managers that are responsible for about $18 trillion of assets. Wow. So that''s traditional institutions. Mm-hmm. That are some of the largest issues. Now, it might not be reflected in the market fully yet because a lot of the institutions take a little bit of time before they turn on the dial. Yeah. They need some of the tool set. They need some of the, some of the credits. And so we''re seeing that happen, but it''s, it''s, you know, we''re seeing a lot more involvement from banks who are some of our investors and clients. We''re seeing a lot of involvement from asset managers. And obviously on the, on the global demand, you know, I just came back from Bangkok. We''re also seeing retail aggregators really turn on the, the capabilities coming at mass and, and being able to provide something to the client. So very interesting years, a year ahead, I think in 2025 for us. Okay. So you''re seeing, yeah, retail investors while in Asia among. Absolutely. Yeah. To, to balance that institutional interest also. And Fiona, I would love to ask you in your view, what is most key to enabling, you know, widespread adoption? Among the institutional community. Yeah. You know, I think Anton, you described the challenge of liquidity very well. If I take a step back before that, you know, at Ripple, our belief is that you have to prove utility to really enable adoption and you need trust. So those two things are the precursor to massive change. And if I look at utility for a moment for us at Ripple, you know, we started over 10 years ago with a challenge and that was cross border payments are broken. Okay. There. And everyone who sends money overseas has probably experienced this. Things have improved massively over the 10 years that we''ve been in business, but, you know, high cost, low transparency, very slow. And so that was the simple problem statement that we set out to solve. And by and large, you know, we''ve proven that there''s utility in crypto markets. So today where I sit, we move billions of dollars of value through crypto, through stables and pay out in over 80 markets. So we''re where our own, you know, eating our own dog food, our own best use case of where there''s utility, there''s adoption. And we''re working with regulated financial institutions around the world to move that value. That second piece of trust cannot be underestimated. And we all saw what happened when FTX went down. And so that trust piece, it can be a little bit more nebulous. But again, you know, sitting in my position where we''re looking at moving billions of dollars of digital assets. What really matters is is whether you have number one, trusted counterparties and institutions to work with or service providers. And number two, custody. So, you know, in whenever you''re tokenizing an asset or moving an asset or touching customer funds, how do you keep that asset safe is one of the first questions to answer. And so we see custody, whether through custody service providers like ourselves, who enable some of the world''s largest banks to custody, to self custody their digital assets, or indeed through the proliferation of more licensed custodians who are moving into the digital asset space, as really that trend is something that will mimic TradFi and provide safe, trusted institutions to operate with. And that unlocks a lot of interest from institutions who want to move into this space, but just don''t have all of the players that they can trust and operate with. Thank you. And that raises the kind of issue of compliance and security and is something that I wanted to ask Laurie about. And kind of what are some of the specialties that some of your clients come to you requesting, you know, demanding from the partnerships that they team up with you on? So building on that question, I know what our clients look for. I think first is education and knowledge, as Tim mentioned. I think there''s a it''s a very complicated space. And so being a trusted source of information is probably the our first value add. And then there''s just regulatory frameworks that are clear and understandable. And that''s coming along. And then as you as you just asked about security and and compliance. And so there aren''t that many companies in this space still from a service provider perspective that actually have, for example, like very tactical, but like sweet sweet sweet level for their chief security officer or the chief regulatory officer. And I think those institutions will only feel comfortable interacting with service providers if you can provide that. So certainly we spend a lot of time. We''re starting to see more and more RFPs that are in the hundreds of pages and a professional RFP. So as an organization and a service provider, those are kind of the minimal requirements now. And as we grow up as an industry, I think we''ll see more and more people able to do that. But certainly you have to be able to answer, you know, 100 pages on various regulations and compliance, various security procedures, processes, etc. So it''s kind of in the weeds. It''s pretty tactical, but there''s it won''t move forward until we as an industry and service providers can do that well. Thank you. And certainly it seems like Hong Kong and Singapore have emerged as kind of pioneers or there''s a bit of competition to be first movers in the space, especially when it comes to regulation. But I wanted to ask all of you kind of which regional endeavors are you seeing across Asia that excite you the most? There''s things happening. There''s Project Acacia in Australia. There''s lots happening in Singapore. Ensemble consensus in Hong Kong, which is quite exciting. Who wants to jump in on that? This has been at least last year. This has been our largest market from a growth perspective. So in general, more so than North America and Europe. I think that''ll probably rotate back into North America this year for obvious reasons. One of the complicating factors here is that you do have a lot of regions with a lot of different regulatory frameworks and the regulators are very different in each one of them. So the difference between the Japanese regulators and the Singaporean regulators, for example, they have nothing in common, really. So that''s that''s certainly one complicating factor for the region. I know. So Europe has a single regulatory authority, so that makes it easy there. And obviously the US has won. So I don''t know. That''s probably the good and the bad of the region that I''ve seen. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think, you know, we we tell us a global firm like like many here. Right. We are monitoring what''s happening across the different jurisdictions, different countries. There''s always interesting things that are being pushed forward by the regulator in different countries. I think in Singapore, it''s it''s a Guardian Guardian. Guardian, Ubin. There''s a few. For me, the the thing that are most interesting to us. So ultimately our belief that all assets are digital assets. And I think that there''s nobody that would disagree with that. But, you know, maybe there''s a question of time, but that''s the direction we''re headed to. So when we look for those kind of sandboxes, we were looking for stuff that will truly help us see how it''s actually going to be impacting and changing the financial industry. So looking at efficiency, looking at projects that are, you know, looking at the centralized markets versus decentralized markets, you know, the centralized markets are extremely efficient in some sense. You know, there are definitely challenges, especially on the KYC, AML and some of the security aspects. There''s no question like it''s, you know, needs to go through another layer before the institutions can can properly adapt with it. But we are seeing a level of innovation in these decentralized markets that we haven''t seen in centralized markets. We can do things a lot faster, a lot more programmatically. So it''s interesting to see like we are really excited about initiatives that are looking how to blend some of the expertise that are happening in the centralized space and centralized space as well. That''s a really good point. Kind of leapfrogging traditional finance, I guess, like being able to innovate quickly and move forward. And can I ask a bit about the benefits that the developments in the US might bring to Asia as a whole? What do you foresee over the next 12 months? Again, sort of the first time in my fairly long, long career in technology too long. The US usually led the rest of the world and they''ve been behind, which is quite it hasn''t really happened in 20, 30 years. I''ve used a quote often that Winston Churchill said the Americans will do the right thing after they''ve tried everything else. And so we''re through the trying everything else stage finally. And so I think that just having because there''s so much institutional capital in America, I think that''ll drive. I think there''s in some Asian markets, you can confirm this or not, there''s a conservatism and that I think will be hopefully we can move through that when you start seeing the largest American financial institutions comfortable with the space. This topic is one that I think about a lot because I look after Asia and we benefited in Asia a huge amount when the former regime in the US was anti-crypto because we had capital flight, we had flight of innovation. You know, you mentioned those projects that are really amazing examples of public and private collaboration led in Asia. And that wave meant that for Ripple more than 50% of our global payment volume moved over to the Singapore entity. And so we benefited then. So it''s something that I think from a competitive standpoint, a lot about now. But I don''t see a challenge coming from from more competition. What I see is with the US becoming crypto friendly with the repeal of Saab 121, with some of these very large players now dipping a toe in the water and not blocking business elsewhere, that everyone will benefit. So, you know, many of those in the room here today will have experience, particularly if you''re a crypto native, how do you pay invoices if your bank is not crypto friendly? And many of those banks are some of the largest US banks. And so, you know, with this new wave, I''m really, really excited to see that that competition will move into Asia and accelerate everyone''s adoption. Yeah, maybe maybe just another point on that. Right. The there''s so I completely agree. I think that the you can even take it a little bit further if you''re thinking globally. United States unlock is an unlock on, you know, liquidity and capital in the entire world. Right. There are quite a lot of larger institutions in the United States have been effectively barred from interacting with digital assets, with crypto. I think that United States unlock will bring that kind of capital, that kind of participation from those global institutions that are being able to do. That might be domiciled in the United States, but that will bring that activity. I think another thing that we we don''t talk a lot about, we always say that the regions are very different from a regulatory perspective. And it''s true, like being in Asia, every single country is different completely. Right. But 100 percent, there is some sort of regulatory benchmarking. We know that the, you know, the regulators in Japan, in Australia are very much interacting and paying attention to what''s happening on the regulatory side in the United States. The SEC and the transformation that that''s going through right now, the CFTC and that transformation is actually most likely going to move in regulation in those other jurisdictions as well. So really excited about that. And we''re nearly out of time, but I really want to ask what the biggest challenge would be to address in order for, you know, the digital assets base to thrive. What''s the biggest challenge in the next 12 months? If you could put forward an idea. In our case, from an organizational perspective is hiring people in the various regions. OK, that expertise. So I''m recruiting right now. So if anyone wants to work for the great staking provider. So. Thank you. Yeah, that would be. How''s that? Any other points? Tim? Yeah, it''s kind of it''s it''s back to the mindset thing. You know, it''s interesting. And Fiona, I''m reminded as you speak, in about two weeks, it''s my 10 year crypto orange pill anniversary. All right. 19th of March 2015. You have August 20 years of your life. Oh, it''s been a while. It''s been a long decade. And actually, Chris Larson, your former executive chair, was the person that turned me on to this space. It was actually I was the very first meet. I had no idea what Bitcoin and blockchain was. And Chris Larson explained it. And I decided I literally would change my entire career. What''s interesting, if you look over that decade, what''s changed? Well, there''s no way we would have been sitting here a decade ago talking about the fact that BlackRock would be the one of the top 10 holders of Bitcoin on the planet. There''s no way we would have conceived that we would have thought that would be a fantastical idea. I think that if you if you just take a step back and look at the arc of how this has evolved, the constraint is our mindset. It''s our ability to understand the evolution that is necessary. The institutions are here, but institutions are remarkably crap by innovating. They really are. Everybody knows this. Anyone who''s ever worked in a bank. If you work in a bank, you know what I mean, right? Like in a very hard to get a bank to move from its very safe place where it generates this consistent revenue. It''s the oldest it''s the oldest game in the book. It''s all about the mindset. I think that''s what we kind of need to go beyond are the institutions are coming. Yeah, of course the institutions are here. Franklin Templeton. It''s BlackRock. It''s it''s the Goldman Sachs. It''s that all the biggest institute. It''s the sovereign wealth funds. It''s the insurance companies, the pension funds that they''re all here. I''ve talked to them all in the last 24 hours. Actually, the limitations are ability to sort of imagine where this next step could go. So it''s an odd place to be that execution is the thing that''s the limitation. It''s actually not capital. It''s not talent. It''s actually it''s all in here. I think that''s the. Thank you. Thanks. And we''re out of time. But very lastly, one word answer. Who is benefiting from first mover advantage? Hong Kong or Singapore? Hong Kong. We have, of course, regulation aside. We''ve got bears. We''ve got dancers, lion dancers. I''ve seen it all. So very quickly, Anton. Singapore, I think. Fiona. All competition is good. All competition is good. Larian. Hong Kong has some catching up to do. Tim. Contrarian view. Hong Kong is where the gamblers are. So yeah, I''m going all. I''m long Hong Kong. Thank you ever so much for sharing your insights. Please join me in thanking our panelists. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('is_there_still_room_for_nonus_dollar_stablecoins_', 'Is There Still Room for Non-US Dollar Stablecoins_', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' We''ll be right back. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome to today''s discussion of a very timely and topical subject, non-dollar stablecoins. I''m Jeff Bamman. I''ll be your moderator. I''m a board director of the Global Blockchain Business Council, the largest global blockchain policy organization with over 500 members, 500 members, many involved in the real economy and keenly interested in global supply chains as well as payments. I''m very fortunate to have three very expert panelists, and I will ask each of them, starting with Rita Liu, then Paul Kremsky, and then Nick Van Eck to tell us a brief introduction of yourself and what your company does in the non-US dollar stablecoin ecosystem. Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Jeff. Hi, everyone. I''m Rita, CEO of RD Technologies. So we do a few things. We run the biggest B2B stablecoin payment platform here in Hong Kong. We actually are infrastructure for lots of OTC, crypto payment companies here in Hong Kong. And in the meantime, we''re also a stablecoin issuer. We''re one of the three companies that are in the stablecoin sandbox by Hong Kong MA. So that''s our link to non-US dollar stablecoin. So, but just a word here. So Hong Kong''s stablecoin regulation is currency agnostic. So any currency is, you know, within scope. So Hong Kong stablecoin doesn''t equal Hong Kong dollar stablecoin. But we are issuing a Hong Kong dollar stablecoin to start with, and we''ll explore more. Thanks. That''s great. And we''ll drill down more into both why Hong Kong and then what Hong Kong versus other stablecoin potentials. Paul. Yeah. Paul Kremsky. Can everyone hear me? So my name is Paul. I run business development for Cumberland. We are a liquidity provider. We''re not an issuer. So we work with stablecoin projects in order to provide liquidity on centralized exchanges, on decentralized exchanges, and in the OTC market. We also trade non-stablecoin products. But frankly, we have the most fun, and it seems a little bit weird to say, we have the most fun working on stablecoin projects because it is a really interesting market that requires a deep understanding of market structure and balance sheet. And frankly, in the non-dollar space, it''s a market that still has to be built, and that''s where we have the most fun. That''s great. And Nick Van Eck from Agora. Nick Van Eck. I''m the CEO and one of the co-founders of Agora. We''re a U.S. dollar stablecoin issuer, but we''re also building up the stack or sort of downstream from us into both the infrastructure on an off-ramp layer as well as the application layer. And so doing a number of things across payments. You''ll see us doing treasury management and potentially some other things down the road. That''s great. That''s great. So we''re very fortunate to have three real experts who are hands-on in the space. So I think to get the conversation started, it''s always helpful to start with numbers, data, some metrics. And we''re fortunate that Paul has actually written on this topic both in terms of overall stablecoin volumes as well as the volumes around non-dollar stablecoins. Paul, could you give us some numbers and some context in terms of what the metrics are and how that''s looked over the last few years? Yeah. I can give a where are we now. You know, I''m sure most of you guys know stablecoins in general are at about 200 billion. That is largely Tether and Circle, AUSD, dollar stablecoins. In fact, dollar stablecoins amounts for 99.2% of all of the stablecoin market cap. So to say that there are only dollar stablecoins is not much of an exaggeration. To draw a comparison, 60% of the money supply is dollars, of the global money supply. So it makes sense that dollars are the dominance currency. It probably doesn''t make sense that they''re over 99%. And so when we look at that and we say, like, okay, where is this market going to be in the next three years? First off, I don''t think it will still be 99%. I don''t think it will be 60%, but maybe 80%. That opens up a lot of space for other currencies, including euro, predominantly euro, but also including Hong Kong dollar, including Singapore dollar, including Australian dollar, etc. The other thing that I think is hopefully a non-controversial statement, I don''t think that stablecoins three to five years from now will still be at 200 billion. I could say a trillion. That''s probably underselling it. You know, stablecoins are really the product that has found market fit. And I know you just said that five minutes ago and I''m stealing your line, but it''s the successful products from digital assets so far. It really is. And the trajectory is only going up. And so to speculate and say this thing looks like it''s going to keep on going, you know, that means you can make some interesting bets. And to say, like, okay, I really want to lean in and work with someone like RD Group. I''m making three bets, right? I''m making a bet on Rita and her ability to execute, which I feel very confident in. I''m making a bet on Hong Kong dollars in general and that Hong Kong dollars are going to occupy more than the zero point something percent that they occupy now. But I''m also making a really, really easy bet, which is I just I think stablecoins are going to grow in general. And so the entire base is going to grow. Great. So, you know, Paul, first of all, taking advantage of first mover advantage to take an insight that Nick made backstage. But to get to say it first, well done. Secondly, the overall pie of stablecoin market cap is going to grow, which I think most people have consensus around. One last question about the metrics, Paul. That tiny, tiny little sliver that exists today that''s non-USD. How much of that is, you know, when you get in that little section, how much is euro? How much is Hong Kong dollar or other currencies? What currencies can we be can we see right now in the existing landscape? It''s predominantly euro. And it makes sense. Euro is the after dollar euro is the largest currency. It makes sense. Euro has actually a pretty it''s got a regulatory framework in place. And it''s kind of where we think Hong Kong is going as well as in terms of putting the rules of the road down. And so Circle has a stablecoin company called Stabler has a stablecoin, which is starting to get listed on several exchanges. And there starts to be kind of a little bit of a spread out there. I think the question of why we''ve seen so little growth in the non-dollar space, there are different use cases for stablecoins. And the first two are also the biggest, right? The first two are centralized exchange trading, trading on Binance and OKEx and Coinbase and Binance and Bybit. That you really want all one currency. You don''t want liquidity to fragments. And the next use case is like access to the U.S. dollar, right? Folks in the global south, the reason they''re using stablecoins is not so they can get involved with crypto. It''s because they want dollars. But there are other use cases for stablecoins that have not grown as much that all benefit from non-dollars. Decentralized trade. And let''s give the panelists weigh in on the other topic. I know we could just go on like that. So Rita, we''re here in Hong Kong. Paul has already spoken about his confidence in you to execute. Clearly, we''d like you to tell the audience what it is that you''re executing. Why have you located yourself in Hong Kong? Why is your company here? What are you focusing on? What are the advantages? Why Hong Kong? Yeah, yeah. So I was going to follow up on Paul''s statement anyway. So I think, you know, there are use cases like payment that''s still yet to take off. Even though, you know, like we have seen some adoption now. But, you know, for it to really take off, for example, in the B2B space, Hong Kong is the place to be, right? You have to come to Asia. Why? Because it''s the biggest export center in the world. So we are here like processing all this B2B stablecoin payment flow here. And we can see, you know, the merchants, the payment companies that are helping the merchants, you know, receive funds from all over the world, is actively, are actually moving into stablecoin, right? So that''s why Hong Kong, so Hong Kong traditionally has always been the hub for any money flowing into and outside of China. It has always been that way because this is the free-flowing currency is free-flowing, freely traded here. And it''s a financial center. So it has always been that way. And now stablecoin is legal here. So it''s the biggest opportunity for Hong Kong because everything, the stablecoin coming here, coming to this region, will need to land here first, right? So and we''ll do an on-off ramp and the money will go to China or go to the merchant suppliers around the world. So last year, Hong Kong''s B2B payment flow is $12 trillion. So we just moved 10% of that into stablecoin. That''s huge. That''s already bigger than the existing volume. So and that''s actively happening. We''re not talking here. We''re actually walking the talk actually because we''re actually processing that volume. So yeah, that''s why we''re in Hong Kong because it''s powering the biggest export center in the world. Great. Great. And you know, makes sense. And those are obviously some heavy-duty numbers that we''re looking at just based on kind of existing activities. And you mentioned in your introduction that you''re one of just, I think, three participants in the existing sandbox that Hong Kong or HKMA has set up. Can you explain a little bit more about, you know, what is the sandbox? How long it''s been around? What does that let you do? And then, you know, maybe also where is Hong Kong in the process of rolling out the full stablecoin legislation that will empower this fully? Yeah. So the legislation is that second reading now. So the first reading is done. So it''s the government. The first reading for the non-regulatory experts. What does that mean? Oh, it''s basically for the LegCo members to go through the bill that''s presented to the LegCo. And so there will be three readings. And after that, they will go through the legislation process. So that''s actually progressing. And sandbox is supposed to be trial before licensing. Right. So after legislation, there will be licensing. And sandbox is supposed to be a trial before licensing. And there were three companies that were selected into the sandbox to trial the stablecoin under Hong Kong''s regulation. So I''ll just quickly add on about Hong Kong dollar. Right. So we are all three companies in the sandbox are all talking about beginning with starting with the Hong Kong dollar one. Why? Because actually, again, we have the privilege of looking at of actually processing those stablecoin flow that''s going through Hong Kong. Actually, 65% or so is U.S. dollar. And 25% or so is Hong Kong dollar. Right. Like in the fiat sense. So in the payment we process, actually Hong Kong dollar is not that small. So in Hong Kong, traditionally, the deposit is held half in U.S. dollar, half in Hong Kong dollar. So for Hong Kong, actually Hong Kong dollar has a huge opportunity. And and also for the traditional stratified institutions to come to this space. Everyone has been waiting for regulation. Right. So without compliance and regulation, they are hesitant to come in. So we believe, you know, when when when, you know, the license is out, all this volume will be able to get more volume, new volume into crypto through our stablecoin. Yeah, that that''s great. And, you know, something attractive about the Hong Kong regulatory framework is not not only will it provide a stable regulatory foundation for Hong Kong dollar, but also for its its currency agnostic, which creates opportunities for for other currencies as well, which which does potentially make it an attractive place to to build. And it''s quite pragmatic. Nick, thank you for your for your patience. And we now we now come to you. Obviously, you''re you''ve devoted yourself to building in the space. We hear rumors you might be spending more time in Hong Kong here yourself. You know, what do you see as some of the impediments that you''ve identified to building out non U.S. dollar stable coins? And, you know, how are you tackling those impediments and what use cases are you trying to solve for? Yeah, I think Paul called this out correctly, which is most of stablecoin demand today has been trading on centralized crypto exchanges. And then, you know, the second bucket being U.S. dollar demand. Right. And so I think one of the bigger impediments is that for HKD or GBP to start taking off, you need the FX and payments markets to really start start to take off. And I think those have not yet to date, but I see them as the next, you know, some of the next hundred X sort of growth vectors for stable coins. You know, I think we''ve almost tapped out crypto trading to date. Maybe you get, you know, another 50, 100, 200 billion there. But I think the big drivers going forward are going to be continued, you know, dollar demand, FX cross-border payments, and then, you know, different settlement mechanisms, you know, cross-border and sort of the institutional tokenization angle. But that''ll be more U.S. dollar driven. And so I think as we see, you know, banks, traditional payment companies start to feel comfortable using, you know, MPC wallet solutions and stable coins, that''ll really drive non-U.S. dollar stables because there''ll be that sort of second leg of the trade, which today is primarily U.S. dollar stables and then local fiat currencies. So I think that''ll start to actually pick up the usage of non-U.S. dollar stables. And that''s starting to happen now, but I think we''re going to see it start to happen much faster as, you know, and I''ve heard this sort of anecdotally, but different payment providers like the conduits of the world or the BVNKs, some of them are actually enabling cross-border payments at, you know, 50% the cost of WISE, right? And so if you are a business moving money cross-border, it is now way cheaper to actually do so via stables, and it''s only going to get increasingly slow. And, you know, that doesn''t even factor in sort of the benefit of it being like T0 now. So I think that''ll be the main driver for non-U.S. dollar demand, and it''s just the, you know, first inning. And, you know, when you talk about kind of the benefits for those ultimate end users and then the payments in different currencies, are the solutions you''re focusing on, is it possible to imagine sort of one size fits all or, you know, for sort of different end user types or for different currencies? Are there different things you need to build to sort of unlock the necessary infrastructure? Yeah, this could be a bad take, but I think it''s actually going to be much more business and institutional driven on the non-U.S. dollar stablecoin side. I don''t think there will be as much retail demand for non-USD stables because there''s, you know, if you''re, you know, for me as an American that lives in America, stablecoins actually are not that useful, right? We have pretty good banking access. You know, Venmo, you know, even on the traditional rails feels like a stablecoin. And so where U.S. dollar stables is really most valuable is outside the United States. And so I don''t see, you know, unless there''s some sort of mandate, right, that Europeans are using euro stables versus their existing, you know, banking system. And so where the institutions come in on the non-USD side is like FX, cross-border payments, maybe trading firms, those sorts of things. And I think those are really the main customers for non-USD stables. Could be wrong, but that''s what my best guess is. Yeah, I think just on that one, right, not just for non-USD stablecoin, for stablecoin in general, I think for in different regions, the use case where the killer app would be different, right? Like, for example, in Hong Kong, I don''t think retail is the place to go for stablecoin adoption because it''s 7 million people market. And, you know, the fintech space is already so advanced, you know, like you can use, there''s so many fintech apps you can use to make payment. So you don''t need stablecoin, right? And they are fast enough. So that''s why we have been, in Hong Kong, have been very focused on B2B because that''s where actually the biggest opportunity for Hong Kong is. But if you go to some market that, you know, like there''s not so much fintech apps and using traditional ways to pay is still very painful or expensive, then stablecoin makes sense, right? So I think for different regions, the killer app for stablecoin adoption would be different. Got it. Paul, to come back to you, I know you started to talk about use cases before, so I know you have a lot of thoughts about that. Do you want to jump in here on what you see as the killer apps or use cases for different non-dollar stablecoins? Well, just to yes ands, right? Yeah. I got off the plane the other day to arrive in Hong Kong, and the first thing I do before I even hop on the train is I go to the TransferWise, and I pay probably like 1.5% or 2% or whatever they feel like charging me just to go from Singapore dollars to Hong Kong dollars, right? Like that''s just too much, right? I could do this on Uniswap for 12 bps, right? And so I really won''t be happy until we get to the day where before I go on this trip, I can, you know, sit down in my MetaMask, and I can convert my, you know, Singapore dollar stablecoin into my Hong Kong dollar stablecoin, and then when I arrive, I can pay for that, you know, express train ticket with Hong Kong dollar stablecoins. Like that''s where I want to be, right? Where I can just like, you know, tap the wallet the same way that I, you know, can tap my credit card, and, you know, Visa will charge me however many percentage points they are. So in terms of like where do we ultimately want to go, that''s where, right? And it''s a combination of, you know, cross-border payments and then micropayments as well, right? I think, Rita, I think when you''re talking about payments, you''re talking about like, okay, I need to pay my supplier and my supplier is over here in Mexico, and like I need to move money across border. Yeah. But there''s also like buying the coffee. Yeah. Right? Yeah. I want the octopus card to be built on top of HKDR. Right. Right? That''s what I want to see. Yeah. So in the B2B space, which is our bread and butter, so just to give you a very simple example, right? So the VA fiat account we offer to our customers, our institutional customers, there are eight currencies, right? In the stablecoin account, there''s only two USDC, USDT, right? It just doesn''t make sense. Because on the fiat side, they have eight currencies. They can freely, they can use whatever they want, and they can do FX very easily with us. So for us, we believe stablecoin in all these B2B payment users'' account in the future, stablecoin will just become another tickers, right? So now they have all these tickers of fiat currencies, and they''ll have other tickers in their account to facilitate faster and cheaper settlement around the world, right? So I think that''s just a simple example, right? Like what we see. Yeah. So to oversimplify a little bit, like I''m sort of hearing more from Nick, and it doesn''t have to be either or, but, you know, from Rita and Nick hearing, you know, I think a lot more focus around, you know, B2B and kind of wholesale payments being the driver for stables, essentially. And, Paul, you''re saying that, you know, that certainly a result you would like to see is, you know, kind of the use of something, you know, at least backed by stablecoins to bring benefits to retail users. To everyone. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, do you think that actually that will end up being the biggest catalyst, or that might maybe just be a benefit from the institutional drivers, and eventually it brings it down for the average person? I think it''s a benefit. I think it''s a benefit. You''re already seeing this with U.S. dollar stables, where it''s like you can have, you know, an on-chain wallet address where it could be USDC, USDT, AUSD, or they just abstract it away and say USD, and then that hooks up to a card, you know, either powered by, like, RedotPay or Rain. There''s a number of these providers. And you can go to, you know, your traditional POS and pay with it via, you know, dollar stables in Peru or in Argentina. Yeah. Right? I don''t know what they''re charging sort of on the conversion behind the scenes, but I think, you know, to Paul''s point, you could easily see that, you know, Paul in Singapore having, like, XSGD, he comes here and it routes automatically through, like, a permission or a permissionless pool, and then he can spend that in HKD, you know, at the booth downstairs. And he, you know, and it abstracts almost away the entire experience and reduces those FX fees. So I think, I don''t know if it''s a, you know, main driver, but I do think you''re going to see retail start to benefit from this as, you know, the infrastructure and these solutions start to scale. Yeah. And also another example, right? Because we''re now here in Hong Kong, I think everyone is probably wondering, what about CNH, right? So Hong Kong is the biggest settlement center for CNH. And, again, Hong Kong''s stablecoin regulation is open to any currency. So CNH is not off the limit. So for a merchant, right, for an exporter selling to Africa, right? So traditionally, the price of goods in U.S. dollar because that''s the only thing they can receive back, right? And then ultimately, they need to be converted into CNY to settle to the factories, right, in China. So if they can, if they have, if we have CNH stablecoin and not rely on traditional rails, then the exporters can price their goods in CNH and receive CNH stablecoin back to Hong Kong, off ramp to CNH and go back to China, right? That means no currency conversion. No currency conversion were FX risk, right? So huge demand on the exporter side. We''re already seeing people, you know, like discussing about this a lot recently. So that''s also another interesting angle into non-U.S. dollar stablecoin. Yeah. So, you know, a couple of the panelists have talked on the regulatory landscape around stablecoins. Paul, you alluded to kind of the MECA and the European framework, which is in place. I think the Europeans are also trying to make sure the euro stays, you know, relevant and that there''s presence in the EU. We''re getting there in, you know, in Hong Kong with, I guess we''ve completed the first reading and two more readings to go. So that seems to be around the corner. With the U.S. new administration, it''s not in place, but there''s discussion around, you know, seems like there''s momentum to have stablecoin legislation, at least for dollar stablecoin. You know, are there any regulatory barriers remaining that, you know, is, you know, working in the space, you all are worried about that still needs to happen either in other jurisdictions? Or do we feel like, you know, there''s at this point a regulatory tailwind and, you know, that has been sort of de-risked from the perspective of this space? Yeah, I think everyone on this stage is early adopters, right? And, you know, while there''s momentum in the United States, there''s no clear regulation yet and there''s no law. And so for traditional businesses, you know, whether those are, you know, John Deere, right, that has suppliers all around the world or a bank or a financial service institution to get comfortable with stables, there needs to be laws and regulations in place. And so while there''s momentum, that hasn''t happened yet. And so I think once we actually see regulation in the United States, you know, Hong Kong is obviously moving along quite quickly. There is, you know, environments in Singapore as well. You know, those are sort of the main hubs, right, because Europe''s already solved. Then I think you see this really start to move quickly because traditional businesses will feel comfortable, you know, moving in and saying, okay, I know I''m not going to get hosed by this, and I can experience the 10 to 100x benefits that stablecoins enable on the cross-border payment side. And so I still see that as being, you know, two to three years away. But I think, you know, once that is set in stone on many of the global, you know, across many global financial markets, you''re going to start to see this really rip. Yeah. Sorry. And in Hong Kong, I can say that, you know, so for, with the stablecoin regulation, so unlicensed, the stablecoin issuers will only be able to offer their stablecoin to selected group of users, for example, professional investors, so not to the public. So that''s slightly better than Europe, because in Europe, if you''re not licensed there, you cannot offer to anyone through the license changes there, right? So in Hong Kong, you cannot offer to the general public. So I do think, you know, as, you know, regulation becomes clearer and clearer in different jurisdictions, you know, who is licensed in that jurisdiction will become clearer, right? And I agree with Nick that actually the traditional institutions, we''re talking about really traditional payment companies, they will get, not get into the space, you know, big scale, unless they know they''re working with licensed player here. So that''s just as simple as that, yeah. Got it. So we''re already near the end of our time, so now''s the sort of crystal ball opportunity for our panelists, and we''ll just kind of go down the line here, starting with Rita so that Nick gets the last word. So, you know, what is the time, you know, two years, three years, five years, when we will really see at least one successful non-USD stablecoin? And the question is, how many years will that be from now, and what will be the most successful or preeminent non-USD stablecoin? Okay. So from RDE, I think, you know, first of all, like I said, you know, Hong Kong''s B2B payment flow last year was $12 trillion. So, you know, as we are also processing stablecoin payment, we''re hoping to move, you know, like I said, 10% of that in a matter of three to five years, that''s our goal, into stablecoin. And partly of parts of that will be in our Hong Kong dollar stablecoin, right? So our timeline is definitely, with the also regulation, with the licensing happening in Hong Kong, we believe, you know, a non-US dollar stablecoin will become, you know, will become a norm for people in the next three to five years. Three to five years, Hong Kong dollar. Great. Paul? I think we''ll see a stablecoin, a non-dollar stablecoin above a billion this year. And that might not seem like a lot compared to, you know, USDC and USDT. But I think that''ll be a pretty big landmark. Obviously, I''m looking at the euro. Just it''s the largest currency. But after that, Hong Kong is one of the most interesting countries because of the fact that there''s so much money that flows through it. And because of the fact, frankly, that people in Hong Kong are used to having a private institution''s name on their money, which is not the case in most countries. And finally, because it''s pegged to the dollar already. So there''s not extra volatility there. So Hong Kong is, to me, is one of the most interesting countries or currencies. Got it. Okay. And Nick? Yeah, I think if we define like one billion as successful, I think we''ll see that this year, probably towards the tail end of this year. And I think it''ll be euro. Euro. Great. Okay. With that, everybody, please give a hand and thank our panelists. And first, they''ll be around. Hopefully, if you have more questions for everyone. Thank you. Please. Thank you. Thank you.', 'We''ll be right back.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('e764b14f58', 'Hong Kong: What''s Next for Regulation?', '待定', 'Panel Discussions', ' Music Alright, we have here a full house of people, many of which it''s their first time in Hong Kong. And walking around last night, people were wondering about the crypto rules in Hong Kong. And we have here the head of the SFC, Hong Kong''s market regulator, to help explain them to us. Alright, so in a nutshell, how do the rules work here in Hong Kong? First of all, it''s great to be here, great to see a lot of people, the native crypto people from all over the world. And I only learned that Sam, you''re here in Hong Kong for two months. So, all welcome. How do crypto rules work? Now basically, if you look at our regime for crypto, it''s very similar to the securities regime that we administer and enforce, because they''re meant to be very similar. We reckon that very early on when Bitcoin and all the other cryptos are being traded, that it cannot really fit into our securities regulation. It can''t cover, we can''t actually set the rules for them if it''s not fit into our definition. And so we created a bespoke, but at that time, a voluntary regime to govern the trading, the custody of assets, and which later became the legislation and got passed in June of 2023. And since then, we have licensed 10 digital assets trading platform, including the last one last night that Tom was talking about. And then we have another eight applicants which are under processing. Now, this is about trading platforms, but we are now providing, assisting the government, the financial services and treasury bureaus to put out a public consultation on two important market players, intermediaries in this ecosystem, which is the custodian and also the OTC dealing. Now, you''re aware that we also have licensed brokers and fund managers. We enable them to deal in or issue crypto related products and deal in those products by imposing some obligations on them when they are dealing with, particularly interfacing with the public. And in this, we expect that there will be a full regime covering all the ecosystem. Okay, great. So why though this approach? Because in the case of Hong Kong, it''s applying securities rules to crypto. And some might say that crypto is so unique, you shouldn''t do that. But Hong Kong has. We believe in innovation, but responsible innovation. And we believe that innovation and regulation should go hand to hand and reinforce each other for the proper development of the ecosystem and the industry. And as regulator, like how we regulate stock market and stocks, then we, it is also, we provide what we call the three C''s. That is clarity, certainty and consistency. Now, we also, earlier on, we said that we, we have licensed brokers and licensed banks who actually obligated, have undertakings when they deal in this. We also believe in moving the, promoting the institution to deal in this, to move into this space. That is, we are also promoting consensus. No, I''m actually advertising for you. I''m convergence. The other consensus. Convergence, which is a false C. And with the participation of institutional players, TREDFI, you actually get compliance. Because they are very, they are as in the traditional industry, are concerned with AML and other safe custody of assets. And they also benefit from, from this convergence by extracting efficiency. Because as we all know, we also believe that blockchain is, with appropriate safeguards, would actually help extract efficiency in clearing and settlement. So both, both sides win. Right. So how do you see then Hong Kong''s role within Asia? Because some might say that Singapore competes with Hong Kong. Is that the case? Or are they separate jurisdictions as far as the markets go? Well, we, we always compete. We compete with any cities. And the landscape for crypto is actually very polarized. Meaning from, if you look at the degree of intensity of regulatory scrutiny actually spread all over the spectrum. From the very, very light touch to prohibition in the case of China. And, and in between you have, you have Hong Kong, you have Singapore, you have US, which is also suffering, despite the capital flows and the products that they are offering, they''re also suffering from fermentation in oversight. So, in, so in, in that sense, actually, we actually need more, more harmonization of these standards. Because liquidity tend to move from a tight, tightly regulated to a very light touch. And this sort of fermentation in regulation as well as liquidity is actually not helping the industry. Because it will add to the compliance costs. It will also, for, for us regulators there, the, the, the, the efficiency of the price discovery is not there. If you have very fermented liquidity pool. So, if you ask me, I think we are seeing more of a alignment in the approach. You, you''ve seen the SEC is moving towards bringing clarity to the regulation, which has been something that we''ve been practicing and we''ve been doing so far. So, given this polarized landscape, we are having, we are, we are, we''re, we''re, we''re, we''re, have a lot of thoughts into where to position ourselves. You''ve, you''ve heard the previous speakers. And Hong Kong is in the, it''s already a financial hub. You have in the audience, a lot of talent in this industry. And we have a lot of them coming from all over the world and particularly from China, Chinese, which are very skilled in this area. So we have to think, how are we going to make a, provide a regulatory framework, which is pro-growth, which is allow responsible innovation, which will actually be the high level of the, be the hub and tapping into the global liquidity. So, this afternoon, we''re going to release a virtual asset roadmap in which we will lay out a forward-looking strategy by examining what way, where, where we were going forward. I can talk a little bit about it later on. Okay, certainly. So, a year ago, Americans looked to Hong Kong with envy because there was an actual rule book in Hong Kong. But now that''s changed. The U.S. with a new presidency is becoming more and more crypto. How will Hong Kong compete with that? We compete with everybody. We also have, I think we have already a track record in providing very consistent and clarity and certainty in our rules. So, we actually, our regulation is investor protection focused. And I think that is important because you are trying, the crypto industry, you can flourish, you can think, but in the end, you want to attract institutional money and retail money, but institutional money. So, we have a regime in which we make sure that every, every intersection with the public, whether it''s intermediaries like the brokers or the banks that are dealing in these assets, actually protect and put that first. And when the institutional people move into this field, then you instill trust in the community, instill trust among the investors and they will come in. So, I think compared to the other centers, we are actually very focused in making this a trading and liquidity and protection focused. Okay, great. So, here in Hong Kong, the SFC allows for in-kind redemptions for the Bitcoin and Ether ETFs. Now, in the U.S., the U.S. SEC did not allow that. Can you walk through the SFC''s mindset in trying to allow this in-kind redemption, which was a real red flag for the U.S.? I think the Hong Kong journey has come to a point where the TrapFi convergence will happen. I think for, I''ve sort of laid the stage here earlier by saying that every intermediaries licensed with us or with the HKMA, we have enabled them to deal in this. So, that''s why we have virtual assets or Bitcoin, Ether, ETFs approved, six of them. I think the Ether is probably the world''s first, but certainly the world''s first, Asia''s first Bitcoin ETFs, six of them, which were authorized by the SFC in April of last year. That''s the product offering. And in that, you mentioned the future of in-kind redemption. Now, all the in-kind creation and redemption has to go through a licensed virtual assets trading platform, which are licensed by the SFC. And also the PDs, which are dealing in doing this, are also licensed, that has to be licensed. And so they have a proper, I mean, you actually mimic the entire traditional system. And through these licensed platforms, they actually tap into global liquidity. So the tracking errors, the prices are actually tracked. The Bitcoin prices, the Ether prices were very well. It worked very well. So I think this is because we have built all the ecosystem which is required for it to work smoothly. Great. Okay. So to wrap things up, what''s next for the SFC this year? What can we look forward to in Hong Kong? We actually, as I said earlier, we have given a lot of thoughts. We started the regime. We passed the legislation at a time when FTX, after the FTA collapse, collapse of the FTX. You probably remember that quite well. Certainly, yes. And because it was, people were saying that, wow, Julia, you''re very bold in taking this move. When every other trading hubs were pulling back and reviewing that. We were able to make that move because we have, as I always emphasize, an investor protection focused regime. Safe custody of assets. You have AML, FEDF, tribal rules compliance, and also segregation of assets. Many of the fraudulent or many of the concerns that you have for a crypto exchange would be mitigated, at least with very robust rules. So the following year, we passed that legislation and hearing with this journey. So come to this point, as I''ve said, the landscape is very uneven. So we have to, now that we''ve taken this bold step, but in a very prudent manner, we can actually move to a second stage where we can give a lot of emphasis to three main pillars. Innovation, again, security, which we already have, and growth. So in this pro-growth strategy, there are a few, a few limbs to it, which will be explained in full detail when we release the crypto assets roadmap this afternoon. We''ll complete the legislation with the help of the bureau, the custody, the OTC dealing, and stablecoin is already underway by the HKMA. And that''s the first part. And then we expand the product offering and services. By that, we are considering sticking. We are considering derivatives product for professional investors. We are also considering margin lending for a certain customers. The third area would be optimizing operational processes. Now, we know that it''s the degree of the hot wallet, cold wallet, and also adjust our custodian requirements, insurance requirements. These are the things that we will review on the compliance side and how to optimize to actually maximize the operational process. And, of course, we do a lot of engagement like this one to make sure and a lot of investor education. So more of it would actually do a bit of advertisement for Eric Yip, who has gone to the other stage to explain in the panel. But basically, we hope that you will download and look at it and give us feedback. Fantastic. Well, thanks for your time, Julia. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('joining_forces_for_the_next_chapter_in_hong_kong_s_digital_asset_ecosystem', 'Joining Forces for the Next Chapter in Hong Kong_s Digital Asset Ecosystem', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' Hello everyone. Thanks for having me today. I''m here to actually announce a very exciting and transformational partnership that we are doing in Hong Kong. So as you all know, Hong Kong is a leading international financial center. We have robust regulatory framework. We have international standards, deep talent pools. And over the past few years, Hong Kong has been pursuing, working together to make ourselves a digital hub, a global digital hub, digital asset hub, to make sure we ride on these advantages that we''re having. For me, at Standard Chartered Bank, we also believe digital assets will shape our industry. And it will become a key component of the future financial infrastructure. Of course, we fully intend to be an integral part of its future state. For example, at Standard Chartered Group, we have built capabilities in custody, in tokenization, and some of them with the ventures, our partners. And in Hong Kong, Standard Chartered Bank, together with our partners, have been actively participating in building the ecosystem for Hong Kong to become the global digital hub. And some of them include Ensemble, eHongKongDollar, and Enbridge. And of course, the Hong Kong MA stablecoin issuer sandbox is an important one for us. We support the work around tokenized money as it pertains to central bank digital currency, CBDC, tokenized deposits, of course, stablecoins. So I''m here because following on, I''m going to introduce the panel of the partnership. If I look at how this partnership works is we''re very excited to have, of course, CBHK, AnyMoker Brands, Hong Kong Telecom. We agreed to form a JV venture to seek Hong Kong MA license when available to order Hong Kong dollar stablecoins. This partnership has started 663 days ago. That was the first time we met AnyMoker and we had the first email talking about that. And today, we are very proud to be here to bring three people together, which is the oldest issuing bank, ourself, one of the biggest Web3 investors in Hong Kong, AnyMoker, and our very, very own Hong Kong Telecom to deliver this market-leading stablecoin issuer. I''m sure the panel will speak a lot more how they have been working in the last 600 days, but we are really very proud to announce it here. And thank you to your support. Please welcome to the stage Evan Ollier, Marcos Chow, Dominic Mathay, and Nicolè Shta. Good morning, everybody. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you to my wonderful panelists. My name is Nic. I''m with CoinDesk. I''m joined today by Evan, Marcos, and Dominic. Let''s get right to it. We just heard from Mary about this new joint venture. I would love to know, how do we get to this point where we''re talking about this joint venture licensed stablecoin product coming from the three of you? Yeah, I mean, I can start. It was a partnership that we''re thinking that made a lot of sense. We individually, as companies, were exploring because Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government was actually exploring the space anyway, in CBDC, eHongKongDollar, and stablecoin. And we were through different dialogues. We were actually talking already. And then just one day, we were like, we just contacted each other and like, why don''t we just do it together? And this combination of having a bank, right, which has all the on-off ramps, and a native Web3 company like ourselves, plus a very on-the-ground, you know, Hong Kong, you know, POC-level company would make sense in the joint venture to promote the stablecoin. It''s 663 days till announcement, right? So it''s already, it''s not crypto speed, but it''s very, very fast for a regulated stablecoin. I think to add to that, it''s not the first time we''ve worked together. I think on different ventures, a different engagement. So it''s one of those ongoing friendships and partnerships that, you know, we continue to do. So this is one example. And we''re looking forward to more future partnerships in this. Yeah. Great. Look, the bank, the bank''s the oldest note issuing bank in Hong Kong. So a project like this is really core to our DNA. That coupled with the fact that the bank''s been working on digital asset capability for years. About six, seven years ago, Estee Ventures, Alex Manson, that team started pioneering some of the capabilities for the bank. That coupled with that DNA made us have a high conviction that we could create a world-class stablecoin issuer. We think stablecoins are going to be instrumental to any high functioning digital asset ecosystem. So for us to work together on a project like this, we see this as an opportunity to help collaborate and support the regulator as we build out a truly digital asset hub. I think all three of us as Hong Kong stalwarts, as key to the community here, had a real aligned interest and the same vision. And that''s what I think really enabled these conversations 663 days ago to culminate in us sitting here today. So I''m kind of curious just what the timeline is from here. What are the progressions that we''re looking at? Well, I mean, it''s going to go into the first reading from LetchCo. It''s already completed. We''ll go to the second and third reading at some point, which is probably expected in Q2. And then there''ll be licensing. Right? So, and then there''s about launch, about readiness. But obviously everything happens in the kitchen at the back. We''re working tirelessly at this point amongst all of us to get the tech ready. And the regulatory sandbox, by the way, is a dialogue that the JV has together with the HKMA about how do we do this in a way that has the proper regulatory rails, consumer protection, you know, and also the right commercial arrangements so that this is viable. So, I think for us in here, it''s been a long journey. And right now, as I mentioned, we''re getting everything in place. So the joint venture was announced a couple of days ago. We''re all ready to go. So we want to front run this. And of course, the HKT Digital Ventures team have been working tirelessly on this, like Monita, Felix, you know, they''re really the architects behind this. And we''re all so pumped and so excited. We''re waiting for us to issue up a stable coin. Right. Yeah. I''m not much tied. Okay. That''s it, right? So that''s the process. You know, a big journey to get here. A great milestone. Still a lot to do. And I think we''re all geared up and ready to do it. So. So I think for me, one of the key words in what we''re all discussing is this is a licensed stable coin. And I really hope you can maybe just get into, you know, why is it being a licensed product? Why is this regulatory framework important for, you know, why not just issue a stable coin? Yeah. I mean, I''ll get into it as a native Web3 company. I can''t emphasize how important this is. Anymoca sort of as a background as a gaming company went pretty deep into the NFT digital asset space. Right. But when we were even selling NFTs, we were insistent on KYC. It''s very important for us to understand that once you financialize something, yes, you want decentralization. But at the same time, what is important for mass adoption is that there are rails that would guard against some of the, you know, everyday issues that you will have with sort of money laundering, you know, and, you know, CTF and all of that. Right. So partnering with a bank and also a institution like HKT has been here for so long. It''s really important to, you know, certify that this is institutional. Right. There are many stable coins as we know in the world. Why is this one different? Right. This one is different because it''s regulated, it''s licensed. Right. And ultimately, Web3 is about decentralizing trust. Right. But you do have to operate under the rails of regulations that actually exist. Right. It''s not these are not in conflict in many ways. Right. The banking rails that allows the on and off ramp are actually very good. We might talk about antiquated systems in terms of the SWIFT system, you know, corresponding banking and paying out all the fees, cross border payments. That is what we''re trying to solve. 24 by 7 atomic settlement is what we''re trying to solve. But we''re not throwing everything away because, you know, because, you know, nothing works. It''s not that there''s nothing works. There are aspects of a traditional banking system that actually works. That''s why we''re marrying this together to bring the best of each of the parties to bear. I think with the regulations in place, in fact, you know, we do welcome more regulations. We are we operate in a very heavily regulated environment. By having these regulations in place, we can trust and verify with the technologies in place now. With DLT, anyone can come in and verify what we''re doing. So we offer the trust. The banks do. We do. And I think that makes it different from the other stable coins out there. I mean, you know, to use a bit of an over overused term, probably. I mean, the regulations, I think we think are a game changer, right? I mean, the reality is there''s some really great companies that have been building stable coin businesses for a number of years, many very well managed as well. But without that regulatory clarity, it''s very difficult for regulated institutions to use them properly. So by coming in with regulations that are clear, that have guidance that allows us to risk manage properly, know what targets we need to hit, this enables a stable coin to really do what I think it does and kind of should do is create that bridge, right? That traditional finance and that Web3 bridge. So, I mean, the regulations are just they''re they''re paramount. So that''s why we''ve been so eager to be a part of the stable coin sandbox. I mean, that''s been a big commitment over the last eight or nine months. But we''ve been really keen to collaborate with the regulators. We''ve been very pleased to see the progress in Hong Kong. Actually, I want to add that remember that we''re in Hong Kong, one of the most important financial centers here, right? With the geopolitical, you know, aspects that''s going on today, you know, we have to really understand the role of Hong Kong as a financial window and a center for, you know, for greater China and China assets, right? So when you talk about a neutral internet and a decentralized internet, which is what Web3 ultimately is about, we''re here participating in another, should I say, milestone, working with Hong Kong with a standard chartered and actually taking the first step of having building a more neutral financial system, right? That is based on a public blockchain that we see, right? Because many of the banking initiatives in Web3 actually on private chains, right? Here we''re working on a stable coin that is regulated on a public chain. And we were talking about public permissionless being very important. And then neutralizes sort of the aspects of sort of like putting assets on chain that is then tradable. And that''s very, very important for Hong Kong to play as a financial center. Yeah. Okay. We have a few minutes left. I want to look ahead a little bit. Yeah, as we wrap up, what''s next for each of your firms, you know, at least with regard to this project here or what you''re looking at? I think for us in here, we''ve been in the, you know, kind of the OG, Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and, you know, we continue our journey in Web 3.0. It''s something that we continue to do to look at forward-looking technologies that we can actually implement and actually use here. I think ethos for, you know, the Chef unique in Hong Kong, it''s always about cheaper, faster, and better. So anything that helps us get there, that''s the Hong Kong ethos, and that''s what we actually embrace. And I think this is the journey for us, you know. Great. So, look, the Stablecoin project, it''s a key project for us. We have high conviction. But it is just one part of the kind of puzzle we''re trying to put together as a bank, right? I mean, there''s a bunch of pieces you need to put together to have a properly functioning digital asset ecosystem. And I said the bank''s been working on this for about six years. The bank has a global digital asset custody business that''s looking to roll out. We''ve done in UAE. It''s happening in Lux. We''re looking forward to it happening in Hong Kong. SC Ventures, our venture arm, has done a bunch around different digital asset business models. We''ve got Zodiac Custody, Zodiac Markets. We have a company, Libera, here. It''s a tokenization platform in Hong Kong. That''s been a bunch of really interesting work. Some of you probably saw the announcement with China AMC. I mean, it''s all a puzzle. We''re kind of putting this all together. The Stablecoin, obviously, super important part of that puzzle. But, you know, the bank is really about creating the infrastructure to make a functioning digital asset hub. And we think that that not only benefits Hong Kong, but we think that globally that helps put together the whole ecosystem. Yeah, so for Animoca, we are native at Web3 Frame, as we said. So we are in this as well of the major initiatives into the institutional space. So we already have a partnership with Neom. And we''re discussing various aspects of how we can join up as well, right, in terms of something like this project. In terms of sort of where we are, we''re very ambitious because we want to change the ecosystem. We want to spur, propel the development of the ecosystem, right? We have really three business pillars, right? We have the business, sort of operating business pillar, which is, you know, one of the gaming companies'' sandbox, right? Not the regulatory sandbox, but the sandbox, the game. It''s one of our assets. And there''s the native side of it and there''s the institutional side of it. The institutional side of it really is the one that we hope to expand our partnership with Standard Chartered and hopefully Hong Kong as we go forward with this. But the other pillars, which is advisory and investments, we''re still trying to push on that. And hopefully with our 500 investments that we have, we''re known to be a pretty large VC. We made about 100 investments last year alone. Hopefully the stable coin. Again, we start off the Hong Kong dollar, but we''ll explore, of course, other possibilities as well. Hopefully this is the rail that ties in our ecosystem as well. And we have a project prominently called Mochaverse that some folks here might have heard about. It''s a decentralized ID layer, a reputation system. Again, the stable coin can play into that ecosystem to activate and tie it together. So lots of very exciting things happening. We''re very excited to have the institutional rail under good regulations and interacting with the native side so that we can bring Web3 to masses. We''re going to have three to masses. Gotcha. Yeah. Just through this to the masses, we''ve also enabled GoWallet with a blockchain-based wallet in there. So when stable coins come in, then it''ll be easier for us to reach out to our consumers here in Hong Kong. Gotcha. Key use case for us. Absolutely. All right. We have about 30 seconds left. Any closing thoughts? Well, I''ll tell you this. When we posted the announcement, we got the native side of Twitter saying that this changes everything. So I would end with that. Thank you. For me and the team, we''re super excited to be here. And in this space right now, I think there''s no better place to be. Yeah. Great. Yeah. We''re very excited as well. A lot happened in the last 660 days, but we''ve got a lot more to do in the next couple hundred. So, yeah. Thank you. Awesome. Well, thank you again. Thank you, Dominic from Standard Chartered, Marcos from Hong Kong Telecom, and Evan from Animoca. Thank you all. Stick around. We have a number of great sessions still happening. So thank you all.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('making_crypto_useful__the_next_phase_of_adoption', 'Making Crypto Useful_ The Next Phase of Adoption', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hello there. How are you, Jack? Good, thank you. Good, good. So today we''re talking about crypto adoption. So I want to start with talking about the background of crypto in the past few years, because it has been quite a wild ride, right? You see in 2021, the price was at $69,000, and then it''s just dropping value 80% in one year time. And then you see the scandals with FTX, and then now it seems to be having a comeback. Bitcoin is trading at $97,000. You see institutional funds like BlackRock is getting into the space. So where are we right now since 2021, 2022? What''s the current use case at the moment? I want to start with that. Okay. So what we''re seeing, I believe, is like a legitimization of crypto with major institutions, kind of adopting it, building on it, using it, experimenting with it. But we''re in a place where we''re still kind of talking about crypto through these three lenses, which I don''t think are potentially beneficial to mass adoption. We still have this massive thing around mass adoption, like it''s so elusive. How do we actually break through the noise and bring crypto to a mass audience? Well, we need to stop talking about it through these three lenses that I think we do talk about too much, which is one is the philosophical lens, decentralization and how decentralizes your blockchain. One is the technological lens, how fast is your blockchain? And then the third is the financialization lens, number go up. Like people too much talk about those things and not about the real value. Like Web 2 has really dominated with showing and getting users to the real value immediately. What is Web 2 again? So like the- Web 2, like I think about Uber, I think about Food Panda, I think about these applications, which you use and it gets you to a very valuable thing as quick as possible. So Uber, you don''t need to worry about the technology Uber''s built on. You just know that it gets you a car very quickly, very easily, right? And the marketing is around that. It''s around direct to the value versus all these other things we talk about now, which are, you know, they''re very interesting. They''re a part of the story. But when you''re when you''re trying to onboard normal people, normal people don''t care about these things. Number go up, philosophy and technology. They just want to go straight to whatever the application should be doing for them. I think that''s the problem, right? Because when it comes to crypto, all we think about is how do you make profit out of it because of the volatility of the value of the trading value. But what is what about the use case for consumer? Like what can we do with it? What can you actually get value of using it using through consumer lens? Do you mind to talk to me a little bit about that? Yeah, well, there''s some glimpses of of real world use cases that can be super valuable. So stable coins is obviously the biggest one. Yeah. Right. What is this actually? So stable coins, coins that that are backed one to one by fiat currency, normal dollars. Which is US dollar. US dollars. For example. Yeah. And what those allow you to do is send, you know, pay freelancers globally around the world. Protect your if you''re a citizen from a developing country, you can protect your money from inflation by choosing the world reserve currency, US dollars over what you have naturally. And so that''s one use case. Stable coins. And it''s currently happening at the moment. Growing massively. For instance, like in Ton, we have an application called Wallet and Telegram. Wallet and Telegram integrated USDT back in April 2024. It grew to it was the fastest growing supply of USDT. It''s now since slowed a little bit, but it''s now over 1.3 billion dollars issued on Ton. And there''s about seven and a half billion dollars of transfer volume of USDT over Ton network every single month. So this is like equivalent, very equivalent to something like a TransferWise or. Which is like a network for currency transfer in the UK and globally. Right. Right. Yeah. Or KakaoPay as well, which is another one in Korea. I think like their average monthly volume is about 7.3 billion or something like that. Okay. So we''re in just six months, seven months after launch of USDT on Ton, it''s now already doing more volume than some of the fintech companies that are building in that digital transfer space. Right. Yeah. So that''s one use case. And then another use case is around digital identity. I think with my company, so we run Ton Society. And so we are providing a digital ID to users on Ton. So you do activities, you complete different tasks, you go to events, you start building on Ton network. Yes. And you get these soulbound tokens. These are NFTs that sit in your wallet. They can''t be transferred. And that builds an activity-based digital identity over time. So now we don''t need to... Now we have a proof of humanity effectively in Ton ecosystem where we know there''s this amount of people using the network, interacting with it, engaging with it, building on it. And that gives us a whole load of other use cases, which we can advertise to those people. We can engage them with particular relevant events. Right. So I think digital identity is also a big use case. But why are they... Why is Ton or cryptocurrency a better... Play a better role in this? Because as we can see, like consumer habit is very sticky. It''s very difficult to persuade them to change. That''s why we see that in the US, for example, people are still writing checks to pay a month to pay like someone. Right. Right. And why is like cryptocurrency or Ton a better than previous digital payments like Visa, MasterCard or credit card? Like what''s the benefits here? Well, I think it''s the removing the middlemen. Right. Like the main promise of crypto has always been just to remove anyone that''s in intermediating your transactions. So you''re just doing P2P transfers. That gives you a whole load of benefits. Like, okay, now I don''t need to pay any transaction fees. Right. It''s cheaper. I pay less transaction fees between sending money from one place to another. So consumer will know that, like they don''t need to pay for it. Consumer gets a cheaper transaction. Right. Right. It also, without middlemen, now I can custody my own assets. So I can control my own assets. I don''t need to give over control over to a bank that, as we''ve seen with SVB Bank, that bank went down. That''s Silicon Valley Bank. Silicon Valley Bank. Right. Right. That bank went down and some people lost their deposits. Right. And so you don''t need to worry about bank runs. So these kinds of things, they''re not necessary to talk about, actually, for the mainstream user. But there are important developments and improvements on the technology that allow, that help to improve people''s lives. Right. But then at the same time, if you talk about the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the FTX collapse is also another factor. So reflecting that there''s also risk of cryptocurrency. Right. So, I mean, is there any like, and also at the same time, like cryptocurrency is not regulated at the moment. So I think that''s the thing that consumer might not be comfortable about. Right. So how do you, what kind of things that you think Ton or cryptocurrency can do that can help rebuild the confidence in the cryptocurrency? Is it for like more activities or app use? Because you also mentioned Telegram, right? Which also has suffers its shares of scandals because the CEO was arrested in Paris in August last year. So I was just wondering how do you, what''s your plan? Like what''s the, what do you think the cryptocurrency industry can do basically? Well, I think the cryptocurrency industry, just as I was saying before, is like it needs to remove the aspects of philosophy, technology, financialization and focus on the real value of what it can, what it can provide. Right. To users. If you can, if we can do that, if we can change how we talk about crypto to be more values based, then, then people start to understand, okay, what this is valuable. Okay. Now I can send money across the world instantly and freely. Okay. Now, now I don''t need to worry about a bank going down. Right. Like they, they understand the value by using it versus like us trying to tell people about it. Is there an example that you can provide? Like, uh, cause telegram it''s like messaging app. Like, yeah. Is there any like, like, like, is it like sending gifts or like sharing messaging with your friends where that you can encourage activities? Do you mind to provide more examples or us over that? Yeah. So, so in telegram, uh, uh, the, the main, one of the main use cases people are using crypto now is in these interactions where we are enriching the social experience. Right. Right. So when I say enriching the social experience, it''s like, how do I one-to-one speak to you in a, in a more interesting and, and a fun way? Right. So I can buy telegram premium with ton and telegram premium gives me access to emojis, statuses, stories, um, uh, animated, uh, stickers. Right. And these are all new ways which I can enrich my social experience with people one-to-one people in chats. And I will pay for it. Yeah. And you pay for it. Like, how do you do that? Like, so there''s, there''s, well, there''s 10, there''s, uh, I think 12 million users now paying for telegram premium every single month. Um, and you can pay for it using Tom coin, uh, inside of the telegram platform. So, so that''s, that''s, that''s, uh, that''s one thing that you can do. Another thing is telegram has just launched telegram gifts. Right. So telegram gifts are, um, gifts you can give to, uh, other people. Okay. Right. In your chats, in your DMS. And then they, uh, they can be upgraded into an NFT on Tom blockchain. So it''s like opening up a pack of Pokemon cards. Okay. Right. And then you, you open a pack of Pokemon cards and all of a sudden you''re like surprised with, oh, I''ve got a charizard or something. Right. Right. Right. Right. So this is, so this is the same process. Someone gives you a gift, you click upgrade, you pay the gas fee, the transaction fee. And, uh, and then your gift visibly upgrades before your eyes, uh, into something, uh, that you can then sell on Tom blockchain. It does sound like to me a little bit like the WeChat we heard about in China. Right. Yeah. Absolutely. Yeah. But then the problem is that like you, what you want to do is kind of like cross border, I suppose. But then WeChat is like in China and it''s like a closed garden. So you need, there''s a lot of like regulations that you need to deal with in different countries and so on. And at the moment we see like there''s a shift political shift in, uh, in crypto regulation in the U S but then you don''t see that in other countries yet. Yeah. So how do you mind to tell me a little bit like how does the regulation change affect the next adoption of crypto? Uh, so I obviously regulation is extremely important. Um, and I think it''s like one of the most bullish things about this year now is that the U S is, is kind of changing its position where, where before they''ve been a major enforcer of regulation. And, and, uh, in some people''s minds, like anti innovation in this space now is going to be changing. They have, uh, uh, one interesting thing is the crypto, uh, the head of the crypto task force in the SEC, Hester Pierce, she was actually vocal about the SEC enforcement action they took against Telegram back in 2019, when Telegram initially did an ICO. So SEC is the U S Regulator of Securities Exchange Commission for the financial industry essentially, right? Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So back then they took down. So, but so Hester Pierce, uh, was vocal against, uh, the anti innovative policy of enforcing action on Telegram. And so it''s interesting and bullish to see like that''s the type of people that are getting put into power in this new administration. And I guess it will come with some clarity over what, what exactly is an okay crypto asset and what''s a not okay crypto asset. Um, which is, I think the whole world is, is kind of waiting for that clarity to see this whole industry is waiting for the, for this clarity for years. Um, and it''s come with the adoption by financial institutions. It''s come with like the adoption of, of it by, uh, a president sitting president of the United States. Yeah. Um, and so, yeah, regulation important to navigate, but for torn, like we, as a blockchain layer, um, we provide an application, uh, technology to build on top of, right? So, uh, and the same for Telegram. Telegram provides a technology to build on top of. So Telegram has the mini apps platform, right? That''s like a front end experience where you can build an app inside of Telegram. And then Tom provides the back end experience of like, here''s how I connect my mini app to a blockchain and I can make transactions. Um, and it''s the applications themselves that I think are going to need to worry about the regulation, right? So if I''m an app in Indonesia, uh, is my activities regulated and, uh, and legal in Indonesia? Yes. Great. Is it legal and regulated in the Philippines? No. So I can''t be there. Uh, but in Telegram, you can actually geo block the, uh, the users from particular countries. Right, right. I see. So that''s the thing. So, um, uh, is that what, what, like, it sounds like to me, there seems to be a long journey towards the next phase of adoption though. What, uh, how long do you think it would take? Like, would it be like in five, 10 years before, like we see something like WeChat happening in the, in the Western world? Well, at Tone, we''ve got a goal of 500 million users onboarded to Tone by 2028. And what is it now? Again? Um, so we have 114 million, uh, Tone coin holders. Right, right, right. Uh, right now, which is, uh, a pretty incredible number considering we''ve, we''ve, we''ve, that''s happened solely just in the last year. A hundred million people have been onboarded onto, onto Tone network. Yeah. Um, so yes, it''s, it''s a very, very, uh, incredible time. And I think what needs to happen is Tone needs to really become this super app. Yeah. For the world. Yeah. Um, where you''re interacting with it through Telegram. It''s simple, easy to use. And the apps themselves are talking not about the speculation, not about the philosophy, not about, um, technology, but about the value. Like what, why, and why is my app useful? So one thing in particular with value is like with AI agents. Yeah. Very excited about this particular space. Um, and I think AI agents can become this next disintermediation of even the user, user experience. Right? You don''t, with an AI agent, you just speak to them, you go straight to the value straight to what you want. So, um, imagine now when an AI agent can connect to Uber or connect to, uh, food panda or deliveroo or connect to booking.com and I''m funding the AI agent. Yeah. And then I''m, I''m asking the AI agent to, Hey, go out and get me my, my favorite pizza from my favorite restaurant. Right. Order me a taxi to pick me up from where I''m at, where I''m at right now. Uh, put me into my favorite hotel. Right. These are, these are the things that could be enabled with AI agents plus crypto. Yeah. Right. And that, that removes even the UX of apps themselves, which, you know, you could, you could say is an intermediary of like getting to the value. Yeah. So it''s like, how do we remove steps to get to the value? And I think AI agents is a good way to do that. And it''s very crypto native way. So that''s the next phrase we will see. It seems very unimaginable, but hopefully I can see it in a few years time. Well, um, yeah, well, thank you very much for your time. Uh, it''s a interesting, uh, outlook of the crypto adoption. So thank you guys. Thank you, Karen. Yeah. Thanks Jack.', 'Hello there.

So excited to be here, especially with my esteemed guest today, Richard Tang. He usually does not need any introductions, but just to set the stage for the question that I''m about to ask him. Richard''s been the CEO of Binance since November of 2023, having already served various senior leadership roles at Binance since joining in August of 2021. Prior to that, Richard was CEO of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority at the Abu Dhabi Global Market, Chief Regulatory Officer of the Singapore Exchange, and Director of Corporate Finance in the Monetary Authority of Singapore. And I was just told by Richard backstage that Binance is now 260 million users, which is incredible. And I thought it would be really great because I don''t think we get to hear a lot from you before about kind of the origin story and kind of how your leadership roles in the past now shaped the way that you think about it, being the leader of a 260 million user platform. Can you tell us a little bit more about kind of like the story and, you know, how you decided to get into this and also how that shaped the way that you''re thinking about this going forward at Binance? Oh, thanks. Thanks for that. First of all, thank you for having me here on stage. And to all the friends that are coming through, good morning. To all the friends from Hong Kong. Chou San, daigahou. So let me start by saying this, right? So when I first got involved in crypto, that''s around 2017, right? I was a regulator then. I discovered crypto on a visit to the United States, Bokaraton. And it intrigued me, right? So I think this is going to be a big financial future. It''s going to be the future of finance. It''s going to be the future of money. But for it to go mainstream, you need two dimensions to come into play. The first one, you need much clearer rules. At a point in time, crypto adoption today is probably about 7%, 8%, right? At a point in time, 2017 is probably 1%. So very early days, there are plenty of prospects on that front. But you need clarity of rules. Because for the early adopters, I think they are willing to embrace it. But for mainstream to come in, you need clear rules. What''s the consumer protection? What are the boundaries that stakeholders can operate in? And the second thing, you need institutional investors. Crypto is a very unique asset class. For every other asset class in the history of mankind, it normally starts by institutional adoption, goes down to corporate treasuries, high net worth individual. And then finally, the retail are given access to it, right? Crypto has gone the other way. For the longest time, retail was embracing crypto. But none of the rest were taking this very seriously, right? So I always believe that given the use case, the utility coming through, that you''ll see a huge upside on this phase. And 2024 has brought about big changes on that front. We saw much greater clarity on the rules formulation front. But also institutions start to adopt it, right? So early last year with the ETF approval, firstly in the United States, and then subsequently throughout the world, including Hong Kong. And when the big institutions such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Charles Swap, Morgan Stanley, went from skeptics in the crypto space to believers, and now all of them have a crypto agenda, you''ll see that landscape shift coming through. And we saw mainstreaming of crypto last year. So just to give you some figures, right? So Binance started 2024 with 170 million users. We ended the year with 240 plus million users, right? So we added 70 million users in the course of last year. And if you think about it, how humongous is that? We are a seven-year-plus company. 30% of users are onboarded during last year, right? So it''s a huge number. And by now, we have grown to close to 260 million users. So I do think that the prospect is very blank with mainstreaming. But we are still quite early. I mean, we have about 7% to 8% crypto adoption globally. So if you look at for every technology, internet, e-commerce, et cetera, once you reach the 7% to 8% threshold, the next 5% to 10% comes relatively quickly. So I do believe that we''ll see that going forward. Yeah. No, I love how you put it. I was recently telling somebody how if you look at the industry, it''s been kind of like two chapters in terms of the adoption story. It was like this grassroots level, bottoms up type of adoption. And then now you''ve got these top-down forces, right? With government, you know, kind of publicly supporting as well as that regulatory clarity. And I think right now there''s a significant amount of attention, particularly around the US, right? And what''s happening over there. I''d love to get your views. Like, what have you been kind of interpreting out of the recent developments with the US around being crypto friendly? And where do you think it goes from here? Well, I think if you look at what''s happening in the United States, there''s a big shift in sentiment, right? So under President Biden''s administration, Operation Choke Point was in progress. There''s, you know, there are a lot of lawsuits, regulation, buyer enforcement, which my view is the worst type of regulations possible out there. Because as regulators, you have the ability to write rules and regulations. You have the ability to articulate what you want to see from the industry and stakeholders. And the industry players will play by those rules. But failing to do so and bring industry players to court and get the court to rule whether you''re right or wrong. And in many of those cases, the case failed, right? Those are the worst type of regulations. But we have gone through a landmark shift in terms of sentiment, right? With President Trump''s election end of last year. And you see a bump up in terms of sentiment. I was in Davos in January this year at the World Economic Forum. And this year is quite unique. When you start talking to the global leaders as well as the financial institutions globally, unlike previous edition, when the US, being the largest economy in the world, being the largest asset allocator in the world, is extremely negative towards crypto. I think everybody else is waiting on the sideline. But since then, at Davos, I think the global leaders are starting to embrace it to say, hey, we need to have a crypto agenda as well, right? When I speak to the sovereign wealth funds, as Mr. Larry Finn from BlackRock put it so elegantly, the question by them, by the sovereign wealth fund is, should I start allocating the crypto? The question is, should I do a 2% allocation or 5% allocation, right? So you''re starting to have fresh optimism coming through. And the financial institutions are now mapping up their own crypto agenda, how to support crypto, how do you use different cryptos to support different parts of the value chain. If you look at the entire infrastructure that most banks and financial institutions are built on, it''s a pretty archaic system, right? So if you think about how do you do cross remittance payment and settlement, it goes through one or two correspondence banks, it''s T plus two settlement, right? So the recipient received two days later, right? If you do small amount of denomination in terms of remittance, it''s extremely costly. The fees can be up to 10%, 15%, right? So, but if you do it via blockchain and crypto, instantaneous fraction of the cost is great for end users. So again, another example, between 2022 to 2024, where we introduced things like Binance Pay, we saw about $26 billion in terms of usage, right? At a fraction of the price of what traditional financial institution charges. And that saved our users close to $1.75 billion in terms of cost, even at a very conservative rate of 6%, right? But for the denomination that they transfer, average size is about $500. Normally the banks and the institutions and their money transfer agencies charge north of 10%, right? So even at a very conservative manner, you can see how crypto is bringing all these important use cases to the marketplace. Yeah. Yeah. Just sticking with the US things, are there any strategy plans for Binance in the US? Well, we are adopting a watching brief at this point in time. I think we applaud President Trump appointing very pro-crypto administrators, politicians and agency leaders now, right? So we saw Mr. David Sachs being appointed as AI and crypto czar. And that is a realisation that if you look at these two fundamental technologies, AI and crypto, they will drive every economic subsector going forward. Because everything will be built on these two fundamental technologies going forward, right? So I think that''s a brilliant move. And that has caught the worst attention. And many people are thinking, should I also appoint an AI and crypto czar to do overall coordination with the government? How do we embrace these two important sectors, right? But also the different agencies coming out. And we do hope that the next set of rules and regulations governing the US is going to support the innovative aspects of it, as well as manage the risk aspect. But since then, we have gotten, I mean, we are the largest player, largest exchange globally. But since then, we have gotten many approaches by different governments to help them to look at their regulatory framework, if they already have one. But if you do not have a regulatory framework, they are asking us for support to help them formulate one that really supports their crypto agenda going forward. So we are bullish. And the US has an outsized influence globally, right? So I think all those rules and regulations coming through in the States are going to have influence on global outlook in this space. No, very interesting. I''m glad you brought up the whole AI and crypto czar thing, because I think that''s also quite interesting, right? Like these are two of the most, I guess, impactful and important technological themes of this generation, as AI and blockchain. I''m curious to know from your perspective, where do you see this converging? Like how does it express itself going forward? Because I think there''s been so much news, particularly over the past couple of weeks, related to, you know, DeepSeq and what''s happening with AI and what''s going on with that. And it seems a little bit like it''s still on a different track from the conversations we''re having in the blockchain space. But where do you see it coming together? And where do you think it goes from there? Well, I think on two fronts, right? So at the industry level and then also at the organization level. So if you look at the industry level, I do see greater convergence, right? AI and crypto, right? So you have AI agents, you have AI tokens coming through. People are trying to harness AI in terms of how they do their developments, etc. And those are key positives. So we are going to see quite a fair bit of convergence, right? The utilization of these two fundamental technologies in how they build products, how they build projects. And that''s at a broader industry level. At the organization level, I mentioned we have 260 million users. We have, you know, slightly more than 6,000 staff now. We can''t afford to add more people all the time, right? To support our global deployment. So the usage of, again, these two fundamental technologies will help in that. So we''re not only exploring things at a fundamental level, like for customer agents, but also how do you use AI to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of your compliance function much better, right? How do you do KYC, KYB, transaction monitoring, market surveillance? How do you run your operations in a much more efficient manner, etc.? So we are exploring AI in different facades of the organization to make it a very high performance organization. 6,000 plus people is not big, by the way. So we are actually a very efficient organization. But still, we are considering the use of AI to make us even better on their front. Yeah, that''s very interesting. You know, we wrote a report about two months ago, estimating the cryptocurrency adoption in this space. And I think it was an estimate of 22% adoption for Asia versus the rest of the world, which was on average about 7.8. I bring this up because, you know, one of the things that I heard that you''re quite interested in talking about, too, is also financial inclusion. And I wanted to kind of just, you know, if we were to level set and kind of ask you to give us kind of a report card on, you know, the industry and how we''re thinking about this, has it actually fulfilled, I guess, the promise and dreams of, you know, being able to decentralize, you know, the ability for people to access a financial system and actually have greater financial inclusion? And I think in particular, given that we''re here in Hong Kong, Hong Kong and Asia, I''d love to kind of get your views on kind of particularly what''s happening here in Asia and what you see. Yeah, so you brought up an extremely good point, right? So I started my career about 30 years ago with the Central Bank of Singapore. And even since 30 years ago, right, the central bankers, the financial regulators, the financial institutions all saying that we need to do a better job in terms of financial inclusion. Thirty years later, 1.5 billion people around the world are still not being included in the financial system. They are unbanked, they have no access to the banking system, no access to the payment system. Let me relate a story to you, right? So I was at a conference in Europe speaking about crypto. I was put on the panel with three bankers and one person from the International Monetary Fund, the IMF, right? So the bankers were having a go at me to say that, you know, crypto is irrelevant, crypto is evil, etc. And the IMF official stepped in to say that the very reason crypto exists is because you have filled in your job in terms of bringing up about financial inclusion. And I applaud that view, right? So if you look at it, why did AI exist and was embraced by retail is because it solved all the important pain points around the world. I travel the world quite extensively. Many parts of the world has financial inclusion at 10 to 20%, right? And if you look at it, 80% of the people have no access to payments, no access to banking system, no access to store of wealth. Crypto doesn''t differentiate. You can get access to it 24-7 despite the different status, right? Banks, you need to meet a certain threshold. You need to be able to make for the banks to make profit from you before they onboard you and serve you in that sense, right? Crypto doesn''t do that. I mean, we don''t differentiate our clients on that front, right? So in many parts of the world, crypto become the only means for them to do domestic payment, cross-border payment at a fraction of the cost of what traditional financial institution charge. It''s all wealth. If you look at the hyperinflationary situation in the last few years in many of these countries where local currency is going through a huge depreciation, they are much better off holding on to stable coins. They are actually much better off holding on to bitcoin, right? And many of the other tokens. You can say, you know, tokens go through a fluctuation. But if you look at price performance, they are much better than many of the fiat throughout the world, right? Even against the best performing currency, which is US dollar globally, bitcoin has just outperformed, right? So many of these families store their wealth in all these tokens and crypto, which is why there''s such a big embracement. So people don''t appreciate that. Crypto is here actually to solve problems and people continue to embrace it and understand the utility and use case because it continues to improve the lives of so many around the world. Yeah. Well, I think we''ve got time for one last question. Yesterday, we had a conversation about DeFi and I thought that was quite interesting because we''ve got a lot of people here that also have been following that quite closely. Do you see kind of the future of DeFi as something that this particular space shifts into, separates, converges? What are your thoughts as to kind of how that path goes forward from here? Well, there are two schools of thoughts, right? So the one school of thought is you''re going to see greater convergence. Another school of thought is it''s going to stay quite distinct, right? My view is it''s too early to say. It really depends on what the global policy makers and regulators make up of it and how the industry embraces it at this point in time. So if you look at this space, now people like ourselves are heavily regulated. I mean, Binance is licensed and regulated in 21 different jurisdictions, making us the most licensed exchange globally. So it comes with that, it comes with plenty of responsibility, investments in compliance space, security, etc., etc. DeFi space is not quite regulated. And as that space continues to grow, regulators might then shift their attention from the current, you know, centralized space to the decentralized space and pay much great attention to that. So that could bring about convergence when you apply the same standards, right? At the same time, you have what we call crypto de-gens that still try to operate in a DeFi space. So it really depends how the industry, how the community maps out on that front. But it''s going to be very fluid, right? Can''t make a prediction on that front. But both will continue to grow in my view. So, yeah. Cool. Well, join me to thank you, Richard, for joining us on stage. We''re at time. Thank you so much, Richard, for taking the time with us today. Thanks for having me. Great.', '. So excited to be here, especially with my esteemed guest today, Richard Tang', '["And we saw mainstreaming of crypto last year","The question is, should I do a 2% allocation or 5% allocation, right","Well, I think on two fronts, right","Banks, you need to meet a certain threshold"]', 16, '2025-05-13 11:51:08.266', NULL, NULL, '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');
INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('navigating_the_next_wave_of_web3_innovation__where_vcs_are_placing_bets', 'Navigating the Next Wave of Web3 Innovation_ Where VCs Are Placing Bets', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' Hello everyone, good afternoon. Welcome back to the discussion on where the VC are placing bat on. So we have a great lineup of panelists here, incredible friends of mine, sharing thought with us today. So yeah, let''s start by, you know, let them introduce themselves and organization they represent. Maybe we can start with Adrian. Sure. Hi everyone. My name is Adrian. I''m the founder of Neumann. We have been investing in Web3 and other pioneer tech since 2022. So it''s three years for this year. Based in Hong Kong, we have a strong interest in consumer crypto and DeFi on Bitcoin. Great. Hi. I''m Akio Tanaka from IVC. I''m a co-founder of IVC, but also a separate non-crypto traditional VC fund headline Asia. So we actually invest mainly Asia, but on the Web3 crypto side, we are global investor. And I think we are probably one of the most active seed investors in Web3, especially with a base in Japan. We currently have our main offices in Tokyo, Taipei, but also have our team members spread out west of Asia. Hi. My name is Yen and I''m with the Titan Fund. We are relatively new fund. We launched in October 2023 with 100 million AUM. And our focus is to invest in early stage Web3 globally. We have two offices, one in Hong Kong and one in Toronto. And we are in active deployment mode. Focus is financial services, consumer and infrastructure. All right, guys. I''m Ian, VP at Forsyte Ventures. You might see this introduction for many times as I''m hosting like three panels already. But yeah, Forsyte, I mean, long words short, right? We are trying to bridge the Western and Eastern, make our special value add in the space. We have huge resource in, you know, the media, traditional bank, a lot of them. So AUM is around like $500 million, mainly focus on AI and crypto investment and also like the crypto payment. So yeah, so why not like start? I''ll try to make the panel spicier, but no pressure. But yeah, let''s start with the first question. I''m trying to make it as non-consensuous as possible. So if there is a topic or a narrative, you guys will think that is, you know, kind of fade away for a while. But you guys still think they can have a chance to make a comeback. What''s the number one you guys would pick? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I can start. It hasn''t really faded away, I think, but it started very early, which is RWA. And when I entered the space in 2017, then a lot of people were talking about RWA. And at that time it was mostly about real estate, about fixed incomes of very traditional financial products. And then when DeFi summer hit and NFTs, everyone forgot about RWA. And I think the market has matured. And in the last two years, you actually see that a lot of companies are really building products that can be tokenized. And I think people are doing this now in different asset classes. Now they''re doing this with, say, money market instruments. Right? And you have companies that have grown very, very big. So for me, that asset class is here to stay and will become over time bigger. So that''s for me RWA. Okay. I have then something else. So I was just, I just had a one-on-one interview session with Sebastian from Sandbox. And one of the topics we talked about, in fact, was that. So, you know, I think, I remember I had this conversation in Japan. This was around last Christmas. And I was sitting with a lot of VC investors in Japan. Some Web2, some Web3 investors. And pretty much, I think the consensus there was metaverse was dead. And, but I had a slightly different view because I had some metaverse-related portfolios. I was just having the same conversation. So the next day, I actually shared my feedback. Hey, all my investor friends are telling me metaverse is dead. What do you think? And he asked me, how old are the people I''m talking to? And he said, and according to the data they''ve been collecting, metaverse is dead if you''re 40 and above. And there''s something different happening, people 30 and below. And in fact, we have now kind of a new generation of young creators who are only doing business on metaverse. And some of them are now annually making income that''s equivalent to professional sports players. And I think, you know, obviously, if you use very narrow definition of metaverse as something natively Web3 and blockchain based, then yes, maybe it''s not that big. But if you have a slightly more broader definition of metaverse, if you could include Roblox, you know, VRChat and others, now you have a platform that has over 100 million monthly active users. And yes, I''m not active there. But my kids, they spend all of their after school hours on Roblox. So we have actually a different type of generational training and socialization and economy that''s being built there. And I can report to you, this is not made up. For the last three years, my kids, one in elementary school and one in middle school, only thing they want for Christmas is Roblox points. And, you know, it saved my life. I don''t have to go to Toys R Us and those places anymore. Can I be your kid? Yes. Oh, you don''t allow your kids to buy Roblox points. For me, it saves time, so I''m fine. But, you know, so there, I think there''s this whole new generation of youngsters below us. For them, Metaverse is not some weird place, but this is where they spend all their school afternoons. Well, I do agree on the Metaverse part. And my pick is actually NFTs, but I''ll talk about that later. For Metaverse, the issue was we couldn''t figure out what''s crypto''s role in some of the Metaverse projects. But the reality is, you know, as we invested in, I think, Epic Games back in 2020, the Fortnite was the first one to really adopt a 10 million users'' Metaverse. Travis Scott has hosted a concert within Fortnite, and that''s a Metaverse. And that was my kid''s first concert ever in life. Oh, looks like we did a good investment. And, you know, people interact in the Metaverse to buy products, consume the products digitally, listen to virtual artists in a digital way. It''s an experience that we never had before, even when I was, you know, I''m old already, so I haven''t experienced that. And I never could imagine kids experience that. So I do think that when we put Web3 and crypto into Metaverse and talk about that together, it comes back to the utilities of tokens and all that. And RWA, which I agree a lot, is more about you are equity investors or you are token investors. Now, RWA reflected in the token. There are some of them that perform well. But at the end of the day, it is a different risk appetite and different target audience buying these tokens. I believe in if we are going to put more time in RWA, we''d rather have equity accrual, the value accrual on the equity side. How can you generate more cash flow? How can you take in LPs in a more efficient way? How can you reduce your operational costs from an RWA perspective? Now, when we look at NFTs, as you look at my pictures here with the McDonald head, signifying the bear market, is because we have been a huge investor in the NFT space. We are the lead investor of MemeLand by 9Gap, which is a huge news coming up today, launching a paying token. We are investing in Igu, Pudget Penguins'' parent company. I''m advisor of Asuki. We invest in Eucalab, so on and so on. But the whole reason is because we think that the native IP creation in Web3, has transformed from last year''s to now. So meaning that Pudget Penguins was like $2 million two years ago, when Nuke Nets bought it out. Now it''s valued at around $2 billion OTC, right? As an overall company. And you never could imagine an IP being created out of Web3 space with just maybe several millions of users. Versus Japan''s traditional animation, Korea''s K-pop IP. I do think that we have went on to have gone into a stage that native IP created by younger generations in a different format and different technologies. So most say NFTs are dead ever since tokens were launched by several projects. I say it''s the beginning. I see. Yeah. So before I have my answer, how many ZK developer are there? Raise your hand. One. Okay. Only one. Okay. Yeah. That proved myself. Yeah. I mean, I think ZK is one of the few that actually kind of fade out. But it have a very good like trend in the very beginning. But from my perspective, I think it''s still have a chance to really make a comeback because the very core thing it provide is not like efficiency or encryption, something like that. But it''s more of the trustless feature that it brings to the blockchain. And that''s very crucial. That''s probably one best match of the blockchain that a technology can provide. So I would say, and only ZK can provide. There''s no other like, not FHE, not TE, not other things. So I think ZK by this kind of feature can definitely have a chance to make a comeback. Maybe in the future. We''ll see. But... So Ian, why do you think it hasn''t really taken off? Although it had a really initial, you know, I think activity. I think everyone was on ZK for a little while. Yeah, I would say for now it doesn''t, except for like the layer two or a blockchain infra, it doesn''t find a good field to really make use of it like the trustless future. But I think with the AI or the data layer really thriving, I would say maybe it can find a good spot to really thrive again. Yeah. But yeah. So coming to the next question. So let''s zoom in to the like the really hot topic like AI agent or the meme or what I would say, like AI framework. We''re trying to talking about. But what''s the number one pick you guys are recently spending most of the time doing researching or spending most of attention doing investment on? Like you would share with us. Who goes first? Adrian? Well, I haven''t, I haven''t done a particular, I mean, I''m not focused on a particular sector lately. And the over the last several months, I''m quite different from other venture investors that I was deep in the trenches. Like I trade all the meme coins for the sake of learning about how they are being launched. You know, Trump token launch, I was looking at $1 billion, go to $13 billion. I would trade in, trade out, looking in the flow of GMGN on Telegram. I was looking at Libra, Ruttet obviously, Payne token this morning and all this. But the main point here is, I think for upcoming several months, it''s not about which sector they''re going to pick, right? There''s AI crypto, there is Web Free Gaming, there''s DeFi. I think most of this have proven themselves in one or two free use cases. It''s about tokens fundamental. I think the fact, the question that we have to ask ourselves is, and we don''t have to lie to ourselves, is token needed in some of the projects? You know, MemeCoin is basically coming out and saying that, hey, this all your tier tokens, just step aside. We are the one that retail wants and it proved itself for three months, four months. So the three months that I''ve been focused on trading this coin is to learn about our go-to-market strategies. And how can we learn from those and suggest to our portfolios, which are rolling out not MemeCoins, they are in gaming, they are in metaverse, they are in RWA. Can you adopt and learn partially from the MemeCoin structures such that retails will enjoy playing around with these tokens? Now, it''s not that I... Do you find those strategies actually workable for non-MemeCoins? For non-MemeCoins, right? Yeah. Actually, I was just on board as a advisor for revolving games. It''s a web-free game that is going to have TGE pretty soon. So, you know, all the projects last several months was talking about, hey, let''s unlock all the tokens at TGE. And Pengu tokens did well with that in December. And in January, you see a lot of tokens trying to unlock everything on day one, and they got screwed by the market. Right? And now, fast forward to February, something I learned from PIN as a MemeCoin today, they actually have a tokenomics. There''s a tokenomics with like Quirly ecosystem partners that pre-sales. So I think we are actually approaching towards a tokenomics that kind of like utility tokens that we launched before, but with more transparency on investing schedules and more unlock on TGE, but not 100%, like 20% to 30%, and more liquidity for going to the retail''s hand on day one instead of for the foundations. So ultimately, I think the market went to a balance between the MemeCoin structures and utility tokens. I''ll let you guys talk about it. Yeah. So I can talk about maybe payment space. So because we do both Web 2 and Web 3 investments, one of the kind actually overlapping area was actually related to fintech and payment. And this kind of came out of an accident. We invested, we backed one crypto project in Latin America that was run by a famous professor in the Bitcoin space in Brazil. And the company is called Bello. And they basically built alternate banking infrastructure for small businesses and freelancers based in Latin America who do a lot of projects for outside world. Let''s say you have a programmer based in Brazil by your clients in Europe and or your designer based in Chile and you''re working for some US company doing design. So there''s a lot of those workers there who do business with outside of Latin America. And obviously, the common currency there is US dollar. But if you are going through traditional banking infrastructure there, it''s very slow and expensive to receive money from overseas. And my understanding a lot of also Brazilian banks now have monthly account maintenance fee. So not only they are slow and expensive, but they also make you pay for the privilege of using their bank. So they built something completely outside of the banking system using their Web3 stack, stable coins. But they also built in some on-ramp, off-ramping capabilities. Now, you know, we only participated in the seed round. But what happened? The company basically became profitable after that. And three years later, they have now, I think, about half a million active businesses on their platform a month. And they are basically now generating not the transactions, the fees that are now approaching three digit millions in US dollars. So we realized, holy shit, this is just happening out of Latin America. And we didn''t even think a lot to invest in this one. We just bet on a very interesting professor. Now, I''m actually trying to apply that lesson in Japan. Because in Japan, we''ve co-invested in a stable coin company with Circle called JPYC there. And I have recently also found a player that actually has wallet reach of about two thirds of Japan''s population. So somehow, if you could combine these, maybe we can actually replicate what''s happening in Brazil. And Japan is also not a very efficient financial market. Local transactions with it domestically, as a consumer, if you are paying for it, it costs you over $2 to send money inside Japan. Inside Japan. And it''s not even real time. So there''s actually a lot of room. So in Latin America, it was between Latin America and outside world. But in Japan, domestically, we have similar problems. So we think it''s actually an interesting area to disrupt. And maybe this is interesting, marriage of Web 2 world and Web 3 world. Yeah. Our fund is a more traditional venture capital fund. We invest early stage seeds and even beyond sometimes. And we generally stick with the founders for the next five to 10 years. Of course, we have a fund life and we need to exit at some point. So when it comes to AI, my view, our view is we are very early. And the last year, year and a half, what we have seen was a lot of narrative, a lot of narrative driven investments. People coming out with a very, very sexy theme. And then I think when you do a lot of research, then you realize actually it''s mostly hype. Yeah. So we don''t want to invest in that. I think that AI itself will be commoditized in the next five years. So many smart people, much smarter than me, are building AI products. But where I am interested is how are we going to use them at the application level? So I think that''s where Asia is going to probably lead in the near future. They will come up with applications using AI that will really, where they can roll it out to a large audience. And these are the things that we''re looking at. What we have invested in so far is a AI, a compute platform that tokenizes compute. We think that''s something in the future that''s going to be a currency itself, compute. And if we all believe, and I think most of the people here believe that AI will be very relevant, then AI is a kind of gold or the Bitcoin for AI. In terms of applications, what are you betting on? So, for example, we did look at virtual in terms of infrastructure. I think it''s highly interesting. But I think there''s too much speculation around the token and it''s too much hyped up. But we are looking at things like that. We''re looking at the orchestration for various AI agents, how they interact. Me personally, I think tokens will be the currency of transactions between AIs. I think that''s probably clear. And I also don''t think every AI needs a token. And if we have, I don''t know, USDT, if we have USDC, which are more than 160 billion in terms of market cap, that itself I think can fuel. But I think we''re early and I haven''t seen that much. So we are not just driven by one cycle and where we invest now and we hope to exit at the peak. We are there for the next five, ten years. Yeah, I would totally agree. And I also agree with the AI, when we were talking about the payment, right? Because I think in general, back to the question of this panel discussion, where the VC are placing back. I don''t think we have a very specific focus on like which sector we only focus on or like what else we didn''t invest in. But I think it''s coming to a stage that the VCs, I think we both agree, are trying to find the real demands from a product. And the real users that really needs it, maybe in their daily life, like crypto payment, imagine that. You can just, you know, spend your crypto or your stable coin, use a Visa card in your daily life. That''s very sexy. So I think it''s generally back to the product itself and finding the real demands, not just a big narrative that won''t be come true in like five or ten years. I think that''s just not generally what we are, we''re going to placing bets on. Yeah, so the next question is actually kind of related to the first one, right? So we know we are making wrong decisions in the past. And what''s the number one regret, you would say? Like, either in a sector or kind of a project, you guys ever like making bets on or you guys ever, you know, being spent a lot of time researching on? And actually, it''s kind of, you know, either proved wrong or kind of fade away in the market. And do you guys think it''s still got a chance, you know, to, are you guys like still going to like prove you are right in the future or it''s going to like just keep it as it right now? Okay, I can start on this one. So it''s actually not, it''s a Web2 investment, but it''s probably one of my biggest misses. So this was about maybe eight, nine years ago now. We have a global platform. Actually, we have built internal software to look for fast trending products and services. So basically, we have this 24-7 monitoring system. It picks up interesting things. One of the things that our US team picked up was this app that was becoming a number one app among college users in US at the time. That makes silly short videos. And the company website looked like an American company, but they couldn''t find contact information. And finally, with some research, they found out it was a company based in Shanghai. And the company is called Musical.ly. And Musical.ly is basically today''s TikTok. And so the US team asked me to go check them out. So I flew into Shanghai. And they were actually not in the office area, some weird residential area. And the whole team was like 10 people. And the founder''s family lived in the second floor of a house. And the first floor of a house was the company. So when I arrived, that was the day they were trying to launch Android version. So they only had iOS. And so it looked very ghetto-y. And only one person spoke English. And so I asked the company, so what are you guys doing? They said, well, we tried to make an educational app and failed everywhere. And we were running out of money. Our last bet was the US market. Yes, and they said, we got into the college market. But no one''s actually creating educational content with the app. They''re just doing something silly. So initially, they were trying to educate them, OK, our software is to make educational content, not silly music videos. But finally, they gave up. OK, our users want to make something silly. So we''re going to give you a whole bunch of silly effects and filters. Suddenly, they became number one app in the US. And so I asked the founder, OK, so how are you going to monetize? They said, we don''t know. And do you have any relationship with big corporates? They said, yes. All the major music labels like Universal, Sony Music, they''re all suing us for illegal usage of music. So we hesitated. So we said, OK, this is such a positive app. But they haven''t figured out the business model. There''s just litigation risk. So basically, we sat on it for about six months. By then, some other Chinese VCs invested in them. And so the company, three years after that, got acquired by TikTok''s parent company, ByteDance, for about a billion dollars. So that was one of the biggest myths. So I guess my lesson is if something''s getting super good traction, forget about business model. And maybe more legal issues if it''s containable. I think, just like you, follow the demand. That was my lesson. Thank you. OK. On my side, it''s actually much more recent. And I think the verdict is still out there. But it''s within the yield bearing stable coins. And as you may know, there''s one that has gotten really, really big. And we looked at it. We had a call with the founder. And I think it''s because the way it was promoted, we felt it wasn''t suitable for us. And the valuation was high. And today, I think it is the number one yield bearing stable coin by market cap. And I would say that is probably one of the most, most, yeah, the one myths that I regret. How many years ago was that? No, no, that''s most recent. Oh, most recent. Oh, OK. When we looked at it, it was a year, year and a half ago. Oh, OK. But what lesson you learned from it? Like, what''s the point that, you know, you really didn''t make that right decision on? Yeah. I think it, I underestimated the power of the community here. And I think crypto is so much about the community. And if you have the right community, then an average product can become phenomenal. And, of course, it can also go the other way. And, yeah, I think it was, I understand the power of the community that would take forward that product. Yeah. Yeah. So your assessment was average product, but excellent community? Right. Yeah. Because, I mean, very simple, the yield bearing stable coin, a lot of people can do it, right? Yeah. You understand how to hedge, use derivatives, and then you add, you know, funding rate as a, to the yield. It''s not that difficult, but how do you invest between various yield bearing stable coins? And that''s the, it was the community that made the difference. Yeah. So that''s something in, especially in Web3, which you cannot underestimate. Yeah. I would agree. Adrian. Well, I, but by dollar amount is, the biggest miss I had is back in 2016 when I was still with Trefi, I was a BlackRock principal investment. One of the largest exchange by, by market cap now, if not the largest ones, reach out for investment by BlackRock. And obviously as a first layer, it was green out. But the founder asked me, do I want to angel in, in debt exchange, which will probably, if I did with that amount is probably around $200 million now. And that''s by dollar amount. Yeah. But, but in terms of really mentally most disturbing kind of misses is what''s in the bear market. Actually, I did invest in these companies, but I, the lessons I had is I should have invest more. And I''ll explain why. So it''s, it''s a story that I always tell people when I invested in Meme Land. I met the founder for five minutes. I put a ticket and we as the first, we are the first investor. And I put a small ticket at that time. It''s not huge. Um, but, uh, what the lesson I learned is the founder perseverance and dedication in a bear market actually prove everything. And we should have, I should have bet a much bigger ticket at that point to concentrate our portfolios instead of spreading around. There''s another company that we still invested for several rounds in a bear market. The founders lose all the monies in FTX and he sold his house. He mortgages stuff and it''s kind of went bankrupt, but the company is still running at that point. In the bear market, they asked us to, you know, do we want to acquire 40% of the company in a minority? It''s a minority. They still own majority, uh, by I think half a million dollars, which would work around, uh, last several months, $16 million. So I didn''t do it. I don''t think I, I didn''t think I appreciate enough of the founders'' perseverance. So, which a lot of times we focus on the product, communities, the quality of the founders, but sometimes the dedication is actually matter the most. So that''s a lesson I learned. But for Mimlan, you said you made this decision in five minutes. What was going through your mind in that five minutes? Do you know 9GAC? Is that why you invested in or? I think it is, it was, it was the first reason was because the founder, Ray, he was, which was around here today as well, um, has a whole idea around how creative economy should evolve in Web2 and why it didn''t work. Mm-hmm. And why Web3 could help out, uh, for creators to make more money, which is, you know, Harrod from Payne is a creator and how we can, as a Web3 economy, make them, help them make money. There''s a lot of, a lot of founders which experience a lot in Web2 space with 100 million users and can do it in Web3. But second is also as a Web2 founder with, on that level, you know, he was in the first Y Combinator badge with Brian Armstrong. Yes. And he could still go on in the bear market, pitch every investors and get rejected. And I think that was the moment it switched, completely pivoted from, from a Web2, uh, everyone, you know, just a centralized company makes money. To everyone''s making money is kind of model. It''s very difficult for Web2 to finally do that. Mm-hmm. And such that we back it, but with not a lot of monies. So. I have to, uh, wrap the discussion up because, uh, we, we, we apparently had runoff time. But, um, thank you guys so much for the incredible thought, insight, providing us today. And, um, um, we actually don''t have a question, um, time for question, but feel free to, um, reach us out, um, after the panel. And, um, yeah. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.', 'Hello everyone, good afternoon.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('nomad_capitalist__unlocking_global_opportunities_and_freedom', 'Nomad Capitalist_ Unlocking Global Opportunities and Freedom', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' We raised you to leave. This is a sentence that I heard many, many times throughout my life. And when I heard it first, I really started to begin to think that my mother just wanted me out of the house. That she had had enough of cleaning my clothes and preparing my meals and it was time for me to fly the nest. And in some ways, that was probably a big part of it. But in other ways, it was a license. It was an opportunity for me to explore my curiosity, to go elsewhere and see what was out there. And my parents had created an environment and a home and a level of safety that I felt I could always go back. So there was nothing to lose. So that''s something that I started to do. And throughout that journey, I met the founder of our company, Andrew Henderson, the original nomad capitalist. And he told me his story. A story somewhat similar where his father gave him the five magic words, as he calls them, which is the things that our company is built on. It''s our catchphrase. Go where you''re treated best. And for him, he grew up in a time where the people around him were being pressured to stay where they grew up, to stay in their local town, to provide opportunities and build for their parents. People weren''t moving further afield than one town over. They went to their parents'' house for dinner very regularly. And his parents were giving him permission to leave. His parents were encouraging him to go and find places where there was better opportunities, to find places where there was communities that aligned more with what he believed, more with what he wanted. For find love in different places, to be part of things that you wouldn''t traditionally find at home. People often say colloquially where I''m from, where he''s from in many Western cultures, they want you to root for the home team. It''s a saying that we have in Nomad capitalist. They want you to root for the home team. And I''m staunchly Irish. I love where I''m from. I will never turn my back on it. It''s something that''s very, very important to me. Our history and our heritage is something I love. But I don''t live there. Not all the time. And those things don''t have to be interlinked. And that''s something that Nomad capitalist has shown me. It''s shown me the opportunity levels that are actually out there for you. It''s shown you how to take advantage of them. It''s showing that you can both love home and abroad. It''s showing that a mix of cultures is more often than not the best thing that you can possibly have. Something Andrew Henderson said to me when I met him first that stuck with me for a very long time. He said, it''s unlikely your country is the best at anything. Never mind everything. And he said, every single country has something to offer. Every single city, every single place, every single culture, every single religion has something to offer. Why not take the best of all of it? Why not take the parts that you like to associate with, the things that you''re interested in, and build the kind of life that you want. Build the kind of community that you want. Build the kind of business that you want. Serve the type of clients that you want. Why we felt the need to restrict ourselves, I don''t know. But it''s an old-fashioned mindset, and we''re here to look for the new mindset that gives you those opportunities, and really opens up that world to you, and make the world your oyster. Enter those new marketplaces. Get those new customers. Over the past few years, I''ve had the pleasure to deal with a lot of our high-level customers, and create some of these plans. And throughout creating these plans, throughout looking at those wants, needs, business pains, and jurisdictions, I''ve got to learn more and more about what''s available. And things are constantly changing. Certain things are closing. Certain things are opening. People in our industry will understand this. It''s an ever-changing landscape, is what I would say. But when I look at what we do, and I look over the past two years that I''ve been creating plans with clients, and managing plans for clients with our team, I can break down what we do into something very core. We believe in planning. We believe in having a dedicated vision for you, your business, and your family. We believe in sitting down and creating the best possible outcomes by building a foundational layer of what you need, whether that''s tax advice on a personal level, tax advice on a business level, business and company structuring, access to banking and finance, citizenships that allow you to travel to places that you couldn''t before, or give you a plan B or somewhere to live and work, set up business in the future, residencies which have a similar kind of advantage. We''re really all about creating options, and creating as many options as you can. Investing what you can afford to invest, to give you and your family the future that you want, to create options and spaces where they may open up in the future. We encourage people to be first. A quote that I like to live by, you can either do it better or you can be first, and it''s a hell of a lot easier to be first. So for us, it''s all about building that agnostic foundation that doesn''t tie you to any individual place, especially if you''re beginning your journey and you''re leaving home. We want to create that foundational layer for business, for finance, for personal freedom, that should you choose to leave, it still serves you, that all you''ll be changing is your residency or getting on a plan. Freedom in the 21st century is changing. How people live, how people work, how people invest is vastly changed in the last couple of years, and it''s vastly, vastly changed in the last 20, 30 years. If you''re looking for me to define freedom for you, I''m not going to be able to. It''s very, very different depending on who you are. It means a lot of different things to different people. I can tell you for me, freedom is being allowed to explore, being allowed to exercise the curiosity I have to go new places, to see new things, to take the lessons I can learn from it. I can tell you for some people on my team, freedom is the ability to come in late to work in the morning, and I''m not looking at anyone in particular, but it seems to happen. Why are people searching for freedom? Why are people searching for new, different work environments? Well, it depends on where you''re coming from. Traditionally, we''ve seen people from the West in our business migrate due to economic circumstances. They''re in search of lesser taxes, in search of places that are easier to do business, where their product fit has a bigger market. Historically, we''ve seen people migrate for a number of different reasons. You see people migrate for black swan events, famines, wars. We''ve seen that again recently. What people are really looking at now when they come to us is they''re looking to take some autonomy. They''re looking to be in somewhat of a controlled situation where they''re able to pick a place that suits them. They''re looking for somewhere with a beneficial taxation system. They''re looking for somewhere where business regulations suit the type of business that they want, where they have access to banking that actually provides the utility that they need, or gives them access through the KYC that''s more simple from where they''re coming from, or provided for what they have, or aligns with their business goals, or understands their business. Some people are seen to be in a high-risk business. Some banks understand that. Some banks don''t. When we at Noma Capitals look at every country, and not just every country, but every aspect of every country, we like to look at it a little bit like a stock. It''s trending one direction or the other, and very few, and very few things in general, are stayed somewhat stable. So some places are more liberal-leaning and becoming more liberal. Some places are more conservative-leaning and becoming more conservative. Some places are increasing business regulations. Some places are decreasing business regulations. And we''ve made it our business of being on the ground in as many countries as we can. We''ve worked in over 110 countries. We have 100 staff spread out over the world, experts in different areas, from real estate, citizenship, taxation, banking, to get a feel on those markets and pulse for you. So when you come to us, and you explain to us what you need and what freedom means to you, that we can point you and aim you in the correct direction. For business owners, we''ve seen a large number of people look at their family life and their business and find it very hard to balance them. You know, we see people who, for example, a client who''s from Britain and wants to school his kids in a UK system, but still wants to get cheaper taxes, wants access to an Asian market, wants access to hire overseas in a jurisdiction where people are better qualified to do what he does for business. This isn''t a simplistic thing to solve, and many people feel trapped by it, but there are locations, there are places. We make it our business to know these things. We make it our business to investigate on the ground and obviously then working through many, many cases, we''ve built up these case studies, these options for people, and it allows them that level of freedom. Technology has vastly changed the way we live and work. Being able to work remote and move fast, the traditional method where people, where I come from, people from a lot of Central European countries, America, we aim to work in the big office building or the skyscraper in the city close to us with our parents'' hometown close by. Now you see people work globally from a remote location with a decent internet connection. You see people go to places where digital nomad visas allow them access to much cheaper costs of living, allow them access to lower taxation, allow them access to easier self-employed systems where it''s a lot less setup and a lot lower barrier to entry. It also allows younger people, think about freelancers, those kind of people, to kickstart in business and get their first chance. They don''t need to make as much initial capital to have the opportunity to live and work and do business for themselves. And something that we''re very, very pro, as it''s in the name, is being a capitalist and being able to go and start something of your own, pave your own way. Where freedoms have been laxed and have been encroached upon in the last number of years is governments. They have changed a lot of rules, they''ve put a lot more bureaucracy in terms and barriers for people to set up their own businesses. The lion''s share of the money in Western countries goes to big corporate enterprises. The rules tend to suit them a lot better than small local businesses. And we see a lot of entrepreneurs and investors who are not of the highest network really struggle. And we''re here to create opportunities for that. And what areas do you look at when you want to look at creating success for a young entrepreneur, a young startup, or a smaller based company? Well, you want to look at tax residency. So you want to look at where are you incorporated? What kind of tax are you going to pay there? What kind of cost of setup that''s going to be? What kind of infliction is it going to be on your business? How much of your money can you keep to reinvest in your business and help it grow? Similarly from a tax residency on your personal tax residency. What kind of money do you need to live your life to fund your family, to do the extra pieces that you need to have to make sure that you put your maximum effort into your business? What kind of lifestyle do you want to live? What kind of time zone do you want to work in? What kind of regulatory barriers do you need to avoid? What kind of places will make this easier for you? This kind of planning has become an elite skill not available to many. And what Nomad Capitalist really aims to do is bring entrepreneurs around that six and seven figure net worth, give them the plan that they need, provide the options that they can choose from and build these modern plans, modern business setups and structures so they can benefit the most from these. Let me tell you about three different clients I have and how different freedom can be to the three of them. So one client, someone that I spoke with very early when I joined Nomad, he doesn''t want to leave the US. He''s very, very happy where he is. But at the same time, he wanted access to staff overseas. He wanted to lower some of the burden of costs for lesser roles that he was finding very difficult to hire for in the West, that people weren''t taking as seriously. The turnover of staff was quite high. He wanted access to international banking. He wanted better deposit rates. Pretty conservative guy. He wanted fixed term deposits. In the US, in most Western countries, the rates on those can be very low. Access to those funds can require huge sums of capital. So we helped him with an offshore residency, which is something else he wanted to look at, just as a backup plan. Nothing crazy, just something small, Latin America. And ultimately, he decided to get a second passport, just in case, to give him a level of comfort. No major driver other than that. We implemented this plan over 12 months. He''s been a long-term customer of ours, and he''s very happy. He doesn''t fit the traditional mold of people that we meet who are interested in actively migrating or are looking for a passport to give them access to something. It was very much a plan B and a backup plan. But also, he gained a lot of ROI off the utility he gained from his business. When we coupled hiring overseas in a jurisdiction that served some of his time zones better, that worked out ultimately cheaper for him, that contributed more to the country where those jobs are harder to find, when he got access to banking, he got access to deposit and interest rates that he couldn''t have got before, it''s very quickly ROI''d for him. And he''s a long-term customer, and he always will be, because we showed him that what he looked for was possible, where he traditionally bumped into people who would have said, you know, you''re crazy. Why would you look at that? Do everything in your local town. I''ll give you another example of a client I have from the UK. Now, this client is slightly different. He was far more motivated by the fact that he does not align with where he''s from. He grew up in the UK. He lives in a relatively small city. He no longer wanted to be there. He had a wife and kids and family. Now, for him, this was a challenging and daunting thing. He had never lived abroad. He had traveled, not very much. And he was deciding, and when we worked on the plan together, we decided to move him to Malaysia, which, although, yes, there''s a lot of similarities in Great Britain and Malaysia. You drive on the same side of the road, they have the same type of plugs. It''s still a big culture shock. But for him, we showed him that a lot of his biggest fears were easily alleviated. There''s excellent private British schools in Malaysia. His children get a very high standard of schooling, probably higher than the specific school he was coming from. The taxation situation is a lot better. Not that tax was a huge driver for him, but he was still saving some money. The cost of living is cheaper. He still has access to major Western luxuries, a misconception a lot of people have that many of these cities in Asia don''t have access to the same things as the West. In fact, they often do, and many more, especially when it comes to luxury shopping and luxury living. We had a very good conversation when we were speaking with him first, and he was very concerned about buying a property. And as someone who''s helped people buy an incredible amount of property in the US, and was talking about a similar cost to where I''m from in Ireland, for the 400k that it would cost you to buy a very small apartment where I''m from, 400k in Malaysia can get you a 28th floor, four bedroom, white marble covered kitchen, extreme luxury property, something that he''s amazed by and very, very happy with, and he bought pretty much instantly. And overall, he''s very, very happy where he moved, and I don''t think he''ll ever move back. And now I''ll tell you about a different type of customer, one of our early customers, who I didn''t serve originally when he came to know my capitalist, but he''s a long-term client. His plan started off with wanting to travel, wanting to see. He''s similar to me. He''s curious. He wanted to explore. This man now travels to 12 different destinations every year. He spends one month per place. He''s got 10 permanent places that he goes. He owns six of those homes, six others he rents in around local areas that he likes, and two floating places that he does every year. His structure was incredibly more difficult. We had to put things in place where he could have access to many more countries. At the same time, it''s a lot more flexible because he''s not tied to any one individual place. He has a tax residency in somewhere that doesn''t require him to show much physical presence. He can pay zero taxes. He has banks in different areas. He puts fixed-term deposits in cold storage in big Singaporean and Swiss banks. He has transactional banks in the different areas that he goes. He uses different cards depending on where he is. And he has a business setup that''s completely irrelevant of where he is. He works remotely online. He runs his business. He''s hired people all over the world. And for him, it''s a much more flexible lifestyle. Not one many will look after, but it''s something that we can help you obtain, and it''s something we can help you maintain. So embracing a borderless future and talking specifically about citizenship, the power of second passports, the power of second residencies. Before World War I, no one really had a passport. At the time, they began issuing them so people could have safe passage across different territories. It was an identification document. It was made to help. And up until recently, that''s pretty much what it was. Now, every day, everybody has a passport. There''s very few people without a passport. But the idea behind a passport and what it''s used for has vastly changed. If you look at citizenship in the US, they use it to tax you. If you look at restrictions, there''s lots of citizenship-based restrictions. If you look at where you''re allowed to travel, specifically because of where you were born and the history of your country with another country, or the politics of your government, or the war that was started in your country which has absolutely nothing to do with you, you are restricted by these items. So why do people get second passports? To create opportunities. To create freedom. To give themselves the option to travel further afield. To have a backup plan. Should where they are, should war break out? Should there be a black swan event? Should there be a recession? Should someone try to take their assets? The reasons are endless. But for some people, especially in the higher network category, it''s a backup plan. It''s a hedge. You know, some people like to call it citizenship insurance. And if you look at like a lot of people coming from the east now, which is a much newer client base for us, it''s really growing. People want access to the European market because a European passport gives you so much more than a singular passport for another country. If you can become European, you have the access to live, you have the right to work in every European country. You have access to different standards of healthcare, you have access to different standards of schooling, you have access to foreign languages if you want your children to learn them, if you want to learn them yourselves. It creates a whole host of new travel opportunities. One story I''d like to touch on because it''s one of the most interesting cases I''ve had in Nomad. I was speaking to somebody, he''s a Canadian guy later in life, had made his money, had paid his taxes, not our typical client. And as we''re going through the call and as we''re having the conversation, I''m thinking to myself, I don''t really see what this guy is looking for. We haven''t really got to the nub of it yet. And I challenged him a little bit on it and he said to me something that I don''t think I''ll ever forget. He was like, yeah, I''m happy to pay my taxes. I love where I''m from. But my wife is very, very sick. My wife has terminal cancer. I live in remote Canada. The healthcare expenses are outrageous. I have no idea if I''m going to be able to continue to fund them. I want access to a different type of lifestyle, but I want to live a similar type of, I want to live in a similar type of environment. But I want access to better healthcare, better insurance, and I want it at a cheaper rate. So he since has moved to Ireland, where I''m from, where he has access to this healthcare, where he has both private and public healthcare that''s much more accessible to him. He''s working on the path to naturalization. He''ll have to spend some time there with the added benefits of, okay, this is something I can provide for my children. He moved his children with him, one of them, not all of them. They''re going to work on citizenship. And for him, that''s a hedge that''s just very, at his net worth, is something that made him a lot more comfortable, that made his wife more comfortable as a country that he aligns with. Not something we''ve ever had before, something we may never had again. But to me, it''s very interesting because it''s a power of second citizenship I hadn''t seen. People have to identify and I suppose qualify these citizenships and where they''re going and where they''re based, based on a number of factors. Political stability. Do you agree with the tasks of your government, with the future projections of where your government is going to go? If it''s left-leaning, right-leaning, whatever it is that you''re looking for. Economic stability. Do you believe in your own currency? Do you believe in the business that you take in and the investments that you make, that they''re going to be stable, that they''re going to continue to grow or they''re going to maintain? Social stability. Do you believe that there will be civil unrest? Do you believe that everything is stable, that there will be protests, those kind of things? We see these things in different countries and there are different concerns for different parts of the world. Safety is a big piece, especially depending on where you''re going. You don''t want to leave one place to go to somewhere less safe. But then yet we''ve seen across multiple countries that are assumed to be unsafe, many people have very good experiences. So it''s something to be challenged and something to be investigated. Healthcare, cost of living, you know, we talk a lot about it. You can actually afford to increase your taxes, move to somewhere that seems a little less appealing if the cost of living is lower. Now that''s not the most common piece, but also you can often do both. You can move to somewhere where the taxes are lower and the cost of living is lower. I personally moved to a country called Georgia. I would never move back to Ireland full time. I absolutely love it. The taxes are an incredible amount cheaper, talking going from 55% to 1%. And the cost of living is probably a third of where it''s from. So let''s talk a little bit quickly about what ways you can get or how you can get second citizenship. So the quick and honest answer is there''s only a number of ways. There''s citizenship by descent. If someone in your ancestry was from another country, it''s different for different countries. But let''s say your grandparent was from another country, you can generally claim citizenship through their descent. There''s citizenship by marriage. So if you marry someone from a different country, again, there''s different levels of requirements. And generally speaking, you would have to live in that country for a certain amount of time. You can claim a passport for that country. Citizenship by investment, which is the most common thing that we deal with, where you can invest into a state fund, in real estate. You can donate to a government. You can buy a number of different assets. And in exchange for helping that economy and that government grow, you can get a passport. There''s also the most common way to get a second passport, which is naturalization. When you immigrate to a new country and you spend the required amount of time, show interest in becoming a citizen of that country, take whatever language test that they have. For us, second citizenship is a powerful thing if it''s something you can afford. And it creates a lot of future options. It''s a big gift that you can give to your children if it''s something that you can look into. And the requirements are getting harder and harder, so it''s something we''re suggesting people to see what you have to use, especially if it''s descent, especially if it''s by marriage. Make the best use of it. So, adapting to a changing world. The world has never been more accessible in some ways. Travel is easier than it''s been and will only continue to get easier. In the 1980s, roughly 43% of the world lived in extreme poverty. The Soviet Union was in an absolute mess. The Cold War had just ended. The only place that was doing economically super strong was the US. Today, we''re starting to see that flip on its head. Less than 10% of the world live in extreme poverty. Places that are previous Soviet Union, USSR, are thriving in economic business centers, some of the best and easiest places to do business, especially for new entrepreneurs. Economies are growing... Worldwide economies are growing at a rapid rate, and they''re opening up more and more opportunities for foreign investment, especially from west to east. Countries are interested in diversifying. They''re interested in bringing in people from abroad, bringing in taxation into their country, and they''re making it easier. They''re taking away bureaucratic messes. They''re taking away rules and regulations that previously were put in place and maybe not thought the full way through or aren''t fit for a modern society. So why invest globally? In a very basic answer, to give yourself as many options as you can. If I look at some of the investment options our clients have looked at over the last number of years, especially if you look at emerging markets, for example, one, where things are cheaper, you''ve less capital at risk. If you want to buy an apartment where I''m from, in the capital city of Ireland in Dublin, you''d be talking at least €1 million for something nice. If you go to an emerging country that we''ve seen people go into recently, you can get apartments for as little as 20, 30, 40k. You can buy hotels for 200,000 versus an apartment for 200,000. And yeah, it''s slightly riskier, but you''re putting a lot less capital at risk. You also have an extremely high upside. And we''ve seen many places and investigated many places, like Cambodia, for example, Uzbekistan. We''ve seen people do well in Turkey, even though it''s slightly different, a bit more advanced, but also you can couple that up with citizenship. It also gives you layers of asset protection. Should anything happen in any individual country, black swan events, governments, lawsuits, by having as much of a diversified portfolio as you can, you have less influence on each individual thing if they''re not tied together. For example, if you have property in the US and property in other countries heavily tied to the US, they''re very influenced with each other. If you have property in Uzbekistan and property in the US, there''s very little influence on each other. Ultimately, we''re looking to get into the market at an earlier entry point and with an estimated higher return. And I think if you look at some of the places, especially in Central Asia, especially in Eastern Asia, there''s a lot of these opportunities right now. And a lot of these residency options, a lot of real estate options will give you options to live in these places in the future. And it''s also a backup plan somewhere where you can go. It''s an extra place. It''s an extra place to call home. It''s somewhere where you might identify with in the future. And I think every country we look at now, we need to look at it like it''s competing for your money, like its brand is competing for your money. Long gone are the days when everyone wanted to migrate west to the US. I think it''s the polar opposite now. More millionaires are leaving the west than ever before. More people have left, more millionaires have left Britain in the last two years than in the last 10. And I think we need to look and search further afield for countries that are less traditional. And the last ones, and I''ll leave you on some of these that I''ll talk about, the ones that I find the most interesting, Cambodia, traditionally difficult to invest in Cambodia and real estate if you''re not a citizen. But there are vehicles and funds now that are proving very, very successful. Indonesia, where buying property again isn''t the simplest thing, but as we see the rise of digital workplaces and we see the rise of remote workers, we see people make very good money purely off seasonal travel, off Airbnb-ing an apartment there. We see people buy it and get residency. We see people buy it and hold it for the longer run. Somewhere we''ve just featured in our web series, Live Like a King, Oman, which to me was quite interesting. The UAE has become quite popular. We''ve seen a lot of people move to Dubai over the last number of years, but Oman is at a different level. It''s much more family-orientated. It''s much more reserved, but still very open to Western culture. And if you watch that video, it''s very interesting. There''s a real estate tour of a mansion there, six, seven bedrooms, swimming pool, very impressive place. And it''s $1.2 million as opposed to what that would cost you in Los Angeles is crazy. And for some people, they''d be far more aligned with the lifestyle. Watch the video, have a look, see the shopping, see the lifestyle, see the beaches. It''s not something I was expecting. And the last couple of places I''m going to talk about are Turkey, which as I said, for real estate. If you invest 400K in real estate in Turkey under certain conditions, please see terms and conditions to make sure you''re in the right place. You can gain citizenship there. After five years of holding on to that real estate, you can sell that real estate. And if done correctly, it''s tax-free. It can give you an ROI on the passport, on your second passport that you wanted, which we talked about earlier. Georgia, where I live. Right now in Georgia, even though property prices have raised at a crazy amount over the last couple of years, you can still invest in something very nice for $100,000. You can get tax residency in a country that doesn''t charge any tax on foreign earned income. You are required to be there zero days a year to maintain it. And if you were to live a trifecta lifestyle, meaning you travel regularly, you don''t spend six months in any place, you could have a completely tax-free lifestyle in a very free, very welcoming country, a place that I love, a place that I call home, a place where banking is considerably easier than anyone else, anywhere else. And again, hedge your bets and get yourself a home that you can always go to and revert to if times get tough. So, in summary, the last couple of points I''m going to make. The world is increasingly more accessible. Gain advantage by leveraging everything it has to offer. Be curious. Understand your options. Understand what options, where you have to live, where you can do business, where you can hold your money. Be curious about the opportunities beyond your border. Allow yourself to diversify. Seek it. And I''ll leave you with this. In an ever-shifting global landscape, there are always new opportunities. So go and explore. You have everything to gain and nothing to lose.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('opening-keynote', 'Opening Keynote', '香港政府代表', 'Keynotes & Welcomes', ' Music It is my great pleasure to be here at Consensus Hong Kong 2025. Let me begin by expressing my heartfelt gratitude to Contest for choosing Hong Kong as the first Asia city for hosting this iconic conference. Your decision underscores Hong Kong''s growing prominence as a global hub for web-free and crypto innovation. This event also reflects our commitment to building a thriving digital asset ecosystem. Consensus 2025 is a congregation of web-free talent from around the world, and its agenda reflects the most pressing topics and trends in the web-free area. From the convergence of AI and blockchain to the tokenization of real-world assets, RWA, crypto and consumers defined 2.0. The discussions here are set to shape the future landscape of digital finance and the digital economy. One of the most exciting developments is, of course, the intersection of AI and blockchain, where decentralized AI can unlock many new applications and opportunities. For example, AI can assist blockchain platforms in performing more accurate credit assessments, improving smart contract audits, providing tailored investment advices, and many more. Globally, the application of web-free finance is gaining traction. Blockchain technology, blockchain innovation, not just reduces transaction costs, but also enhances market transparency, and efficiency and accessibility of financial services. Indeed, we are seeing more institutional adoption where traditional banks, asset managers, and brokers increasingly integrate digital assets into their offerings. The benefits are clear. The World Economic Forum, for example, estimates that financial institutions could free up some US$100 billion per year by leveraging the distributed ledger technology for collateral arrangements. Hong Kong, with its advanced financial infrastructure and robust regulatory environment, is at the forefront of this transformation. Hong Kong has already made history by issuing the world''s first tokenized government green bonds in 2023, followed by groundbreaking multi-currency issuance in 2024. Beyond finance, Web3 plus AI innovations are inspiring a host of applications in the real economy. From streamlining supply chain management to enhancing game players'' experience, and from improving healthcare management to making agricultural and industrial production more intelligent. They are empowering and transforming business operations and public services. Rapid tech innovation does not come without challenges. Often, the progress of innovation outplaces regulatory response, creating gaps that can lead to substantial risks. The fallout from several crypto exchanges'' failures in recent years serve as vivid reminders that we must pay attention to market integrity, investor protection, money laundering, and cyber security risks, as financial services continue to innovate and digitalize. On a positive note, history of financial innovation shows that we learn and adapt fast and put in better guardrails and become more resilient. The key to success lies in maintaining an open, fair, balanced, and forward-looking regulatory approach that is conducive to the sustainable and responsible development of financial innovation, including Web3. The key to success is to be a part of the market. This is the path taken by Hong Kong. While some major jurisdictions have recently begun to embrace cryptocurrencies, which has undoubtedly filled a bloom of the crypto market, Hong Kong stands out as a market with consistent, predictable, and forward-looking policies, and a balanced regulatory framework. For innovators and companies committed to building the future of Web3, or financial institutions looking to bridge the traditional and digital finance, Hong Kong is where you want to be. Our regime is premised on the same activity, same risk, same regulation principle, which ensures a level playing field for all market participants. In this regard, Hong Kong has already put in place a licensing regime for digital asset trading platforms. Our Securities and Futures Commission has already issued nine such licenses, with more in the pipeline. We are also advancing on the regulation of stable coins and have introduced the relevant legislation. To facilitate further innovation, regulatory sandboxes have been set up by our regulators to allow innovators to test and refine your ideas, and to get early regulatory feedback. Besides initiatives like the Hong Kong Monetary Authority''s project ensemble, are accelerating the development of tokenization ecosystems, covering RWA''s fixed income, investment funds, green finance, and trade finance. Indeed, this whole innovation approach and collaborative regulatory mindset are a unique value proposition of Hong Kong to Web3 innovators and participants. AI is constantly evolving and increasingly applied to finance. Its convergence with blockchain will create more use cases, with both new opportunities to be captured and challenges to be addressed. Hong Kong has set out a clear policy on the use of AI in financial services. The government and our financial regulators are working closely with the industry to monitor technology and market development, and establish a transparent supervisory framework. Hong Kong''s commitment to Web3 extends beyond regulation. The government and its financial services are working closely with the industry. We are investing heavily in the related infrastructure and talent development. Our cyber-pod and science-pod have become vibrant hubs for Web3 innovation and fintech, while our universities and partnerships with the industry are nurturing generations of blockchain experts. We are also attracting and welcoming top-notch professionals from around the world to come to Hong Kong, to ensure Hong Kong remains at the cutting edge of this technological advancement. The digital asset market today may somewhat resemble the early days of all great transformative paradigms. As new frontiers emerge, there will always be champions of progress and cautious observers. What remains true is that the market ultimately rewards those who dare to innovate, adapt and persevere. The tides of change are upon us, and Hong Kong is ready to ride a wave. As the Web3 ecosystem continues to evolve, Hong Kong will remain a stable, open and vibrant market for digital assets. I am confident that global companies, institutions and talent will join force with us to lead this development. In the next few years, I am confident that many of you will be committed to the future. I am confident that many of you are coming from abroad in thousands of numbers. I urge you, coming here, not just to work, but to enjoy yourself. Perhaps you, you know, we have over 200 Michelin-recommended restaurants, and we don''t impose any duty on wine. And Hong Kong has been famous as a shopping paradise. So, apart from that, our countryside, wonderful walking trails are all waiting for you. So enjoy this city and come back more often. Thank you. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('playing_for_the_future', 'Playing For The Future', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' I''m very excited for this panel because it is an absolutely banger lineup. We are going to be talking about the future of Web3 Gaming. The title is Playing for the Future, so we want to unpack where it''s going. I think if you go back to, say, 2021, the narrative was very clear. It was all about play to earn, it was all about scholarships, Axie was the big dominant game. But today, there isn''t really one clear single narrative. We''re going to hear from four different perspectives around what Web3 Gaming is and where it''s going. As I said, banger lineup. We''ve got Theo here representing Gunzilla Games. They launched the absolute smash hit game off the grid on Avalanche. It really broke through and gave us all in Web3 Gaming something to be very excited about. Oh, there''s a friend in the front row. We''ve got Gabby Dizon from Yield Guild Games. He''s really looking at on-chain communities. How can guilds actually lead the future for on-chain communities? We''ve got Sebastian Borget. He is a co-founder of The Sandbox, which is really looking at user-generated content, very much focused on content creators. He''s also the president of the Blockchain Game Alliance, our industry organization, which I''m lucky to sit on the board of. Gabby was a founding board member. And then we have Renz Chong, who is from Sovereign, formerly Breed-A-Dow, if you''ve heard about them. So they started out breeding Axies, but today they''re actually focused on fully on-chain games and autonomous worlds. So, what I wanted to start off with is, all of you guys are approaching this from a different perspective, right? So I''d like to go down the line and hear what is your model, what are you building, and what fundamental assumptions are you making in terms of what players want? And if you''re willing, why do you think the others are wrong in terms of why you''re tackling it? So, Theo, do you want to kick us off? Absolutely. So there''s a couple things that we look at very, very differently from traditional Web3 games. First and foremost, we make it all about the gamer. Yep. And from our perspective, what a gamer, and again, I say gamer broadly, not a Web3 gamer, not a Web2 gamer, but what a gamer wants is an entertaining experience. They don''t want to mess around with setting up wallets. They don''t want to mess around with on-off ramping fiat or swapping tokens. They don''t even want to really focus on earning money. They want entertainment. They want a good gaming experience. Okay. So we firmly believe that everything has to be about that. And then secondary to that is your asset ownership, because that''s where you can obviously do things better than current Web2 projects. You can give people the ability to own all of their own assets, trade those assets, and if they so choose, then monetize those assets by selling them on third-party marketplaces. And only after all of those things do you have the ability to create somewhat of an incentivized economy through adding a token. And to that end, what I disagree with in terms of prior Web3 projects in gaming is that we have far too many projects that are in essence gamified staking protocols. Okay. So you have some financial rewards. It''s like regular staking. You have some inflationary treasury that inflates and dilutes supply. And then you have, instead of a button that''s a stake, you have some sprites that you move across the screen. Oftentimes you''re forced to purchase, in some cases, an expensive NFT in order to be even allowed to play the game. I won''t name names, but I recently heard about a project that just kind of went bankrupt, a game that forced people to buy an NFT to join the early playtests. Like how crazy is that? Like a regular gamer would never put up with that. They''d be like, see ya. Yeah. And yeah, anyway, so that''s, you know, my position. And I really, really, truly hope that once folks see a very, very successful launch, which we have coming up very, very shortly, that they will change their opinion as well and move towards the future where a user can simply load into a game without doing any of these very onerous non-starter steps, I call them, and can simply focus on a good gaming experience where blockchain technology kind of moves into the background to enhance the gaming experience, but not to replace the gaming experience. Noted. Gabby, what''s your model and what does it say about your assumptions of your community? We bring gamer communities online and on-chain. This is something that we''ve been doing since 2020. Last year, we introduced on-chain guilds as a way for guilds to have their common registry, multi-sig wallet, and a way to have their own on-chain presence and identity. So I think that''s a very important step because for these guilds that have been playing together for a long time, we wanted to build not just their identity but collective ownership of assets. So think about it as your World of Warcraft guild put on-chain. These are permanent communities that are building ownership of their own assets, collecting it in different games, collecting their reputation as well. So yeah, that''s what we''ve been focused on. And there''s just recently been more focus in putting these elements on-chain, not just individually but as a group as well. Excellent. Thank you. Seb? So our mission is to empower anyone to become a creator. We started the Sandbox originally as a mobile game. We grew it into a large success that had 14 million downloads, 17 million pyramid creation. And we rebuilt it in 2018 using blockchain and NFT at the core to allow the creator to own their digital creation, play with them, and monetize them. Today, Sandbox continues to ship major product updates for the creation tool, no code, allowing people to make fun experiences, fun games. And we doubled down our efforts to improve the kind of game that people can make. We also bring major brands and celebrities like Snoop Dogg, Walking Dead, Barry Silton, Ubisoft, recently Attack on Titan. And this year, again, we doubled down on what we already best at to bring, again, massive franchise, either Hollywood style or like Asia style. And they will bring their fun. They will allow them to discover gameplay, discover web free many times for the first time. We are giving tokens to users after they complete the first time user experience, the tutorial or some quests, onboarding them to web free through rewards and meaningful gameplay and action. And after that, we allow them to create new games using their favorite content and favorite brands, like matching creators and brands. That''s exciting. That''s what we are going to do. Last year, we had our season four that brought more than 580,000 unique players. We''ve grown to 6.3 million users with a wallet in total. This year, we''ll launch three new seasons, at least probably four, that continue to build up on the success. Great mechanics, fun, battle pass and live ops, key gaming mechanics behind. And I think we''ll drive even more audience to web free through that. The other thing that we''re expanding upon is our vision to decentralization. We introduced the DAO last year. We had over 17 proposals voted upon by the community, over 50 discussed in the forum. The governance is in place. We support great initiatives and strategies from the communities. And now, we''re also expanding something that I think went a bit unnoticed, is how we''re expanding the vision of Sandbox to become more than the virtual world and the platform think about with this user-generated content no-code game maker. We want to enable anyone to make games with traditional game engine, Unity, Unreal, HTML5, push them on traditional stores, not necessarily have like the web free wallet requirements, traditional free to play monetization. But if you have a wallet or if you make a first purchase with a wallet, you connect your Sandbox account and then you can access all your digital assets, whether your LAN, your avatar or your SAN. Basically, we''re not waiting for others to build and showcase what interoperability in the metaverse can be. We''re bringing it ourselves. We''ll be shipping free games this year. And I think in the second half of this year, we''ll announce some quite important things as well to allow even more decentralization and empowering of creators for that. Nice. All right, Renz, you''re last. I just wanted to say, when you introduce yourself, if you could give just a little brief introduction to what fully on-chain games and autonomous worlds actually are. Just in case anyone isn''t familiar with it yet. Okay. Yeah, Renz, Sovron. So, I would say what we''re trying to do is centered around autonomous worlds or fully on-chain games as well. By definition, or at least internal definition, we want it to be defined as fully permissionless and composable worlds where both humans and actually agents are able to interact in ever-evolving worlds. Or games, right? What does that really look like? So, we believe that the biggest driver of the blockchain technology inside games would be bringing things on-chain. And it doesn''t need to be everything immediately on-chain, right? But specific components or specific systems be placed on-chain. Why is that? When we started with blockchain gaming, we started with bringing assets on-chain, right? And that allowed for people to have ownership, that allowed for people to be able to trade these assets and potentially earn from them, right? We thought about the same when we tokenized these assets, essentially like soft currency on-chain, right? Which is not soft currency anymore, but yeah. So, when we thought about it, okay, maybe there is actually merit into bringing a lot more of these things on-chain. Like maybe starting with AI systems or game systems, right? Like if you have RNG systems that can be placed on-chain, that can be verified, right? That might be beneficial to specific use cases, right? So, it''s not that every single thing for every single game needs to be on-chain. It''s that depending on what you need, modularly, right? Like we are able to take that on-chain and you have the option to actually be able to bring that on-chain. And so, ultimately, that is also our belief, right? Like we want to be able to bridge off-chain to on-chain depending on the need and the want of whoever''s creating it, and the need and the want of whoever''s using it, whether that may be like a human or an agent. Excellent. Thank you. All right. We''ve got a lot to explore in this discussion, but now you''ve got a bit of an overview on who everyone is. A couple of housekeeping things. Toward the end of this panel, we are actually going to open up to audience questions. So, if you have something that you would like to ask the panel, get ready, and we will have a runner with a microphone coming around to allow you to stand up and ask your question. But secondly, there''s a lot to unpack here. So, I would actually like to encourage you guys to debate. So, if you hear something that one of the other speakers says that you want to shut down, please do so. Good thing you invited Theo then. Right, right. So, let''s start with you actually, Theo. I want to tackle perhaps the most obvious question first. Something that I know that you feel quite passionate about. I think there are some players of off the grid who would love to see a token in the game. And I think you have a stance on that. Could you share it with us, what that is and why? Well, so I wouldn''t say that there''s off the grid players that want to see a token in the game. I would say that there''s a faction within Web3 Gaming that firmly believes that in order for you to be a true crypto game, that you must have a token, that you must be doing airdrops, that you must be, in essence, pay people to play your game. And that is what I''m absolutely categorically against. Why? I do not believe that bribing a person by paying them to play a game provides for good experience, right, in general. If your game is good enough and entertaining enough, people will come and play the game because they want to play a game. Gamers don''t look at their gaming time as a source of income. Like in some countries, of course, right, you know, even like as Axie had shown, and that was obviously a very historic moment where people could, you know, replace a year''s worth of income playing, you know, Axie for a month. Until, of course, the economy broke down because there was an inflationary treasury and it just long-term wasn''t sustainable. But the notion that gaming should be a source of income, in my opinion, is very misplaced and very misguided. I want to stop you there. Sure, of course. Who would like to reply? Okay, all right. So I don''t like being black and white, extreme position. I think there''s like something in the middle. If you did, of course, great game, fantastic gameplay, graphic, everything, you have all the key ingredients, you will attract the perfect target niche players that like this kind of game. But how do you onboard new people to discover beyond that core agent and the word of mouth that they can bring? Crypto, tokens, NFT, it brings various incentive and network effects. The fact that you can offer a reward, I didn''t say airdrop, I said offer a reward that requires action and claim, I think it can be a good incentive to attract new users and new agencies to discover your game while they would not naturally be inclined to play it. And I think it''s a good amount of reward for participation. It provides a dopamine effect that we see traditionally in free to play game where like as soon as you click on a button, there''s like a lot of virtual currency coming up on the screen. And in a way, like it''s also a better way to distribute the money that you would otherwise spend into the traditional ad network and all the web to economical space of like advertising, user acquisition, etc. So, if you''re looking at the market, the value goes directly to the players, which then can decide, do they keep the currency or the token or the NFT, do they sell it to trade it to other games, creating a virtual value into the broader ecosystem of Web3, or do they actually spend it in your game? And what we see at Sandbox is a user actually spend the token that we give them, more than 80% of them spend it back into the economy of the game, supporting the creator economy, supporting buying an avatar and so on. So, I think it''s like overall, there''s good positive aspect to it. But of course, it''s more about a question of balancing, finding the right amount to give so it''s not too little, not too much. And you have to try it. Yeah, so I''m not necessarily saying that there is not a use case for it, right? There might be games where that makes perfect sense and the economy is based on a token and it all kind of is integrated. What I''m saying is that there are some games, and I believe that off the grid firmly falls into that category, where you can''t make it about that, right? You still have incentivizations. For example, our early Pioneer skin, that was our first ever Battle Pass content pack that dropped during our Pioneer program, did 100x. So what used to cost, you know, 400 Testnet tokens now costs 40,000 Testnet tokens. So people still have the ability to kind of speculate on rarities and have somewhat of an incentivization to continue kind of progressing, accumulating in-game items, etc. But those are items that are useful in the game. Those are items that you can only extract from within the game or purchase it from another person that listed on the peer-to-peer marketplace that extracted it from the game. There is a direct correlation between the item and its utilization in the game. A token breaks that chain, right? A token can then be used by any of these other, you know, let''s say 10 million was reported last summer by Dapp, right? Or 10 million daily active wallets that almost like a cloud of locusts just descend onto an ecosystem, extract however much value they can, and then descend onto the next ecosystem. So you''re against the external liquidity that comes in that doesn''t care about the game. Exactly. Precise. Yeah, yeah, yeah. The utility is super important, specifically for the game. But let me ask the audience, like, how many of you are familiar about Sandbox? All right. Oh, wow! Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait. That''s a good show of hands. How many of you have Sand token? How many of you have played Sandbox? Oh, wow. That''s a good audience, actually. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But usually, like, the ratio of, like, knowing Sandbox and having Sand as a token contributes a lot to our brand awareness, and generally of people understanding what we do, supporting it, growing our network, without being actual players or creators. So it''s a right balance of different audiences that are contributing, I think, all in valuable ways, as players, as community, as ambassadors, and so on, that you find in Web3. And I still believe, like, it''s better to spend it within the Web3 ecosystem and directly to the users than to the big corporate companies that sell your data. Wait, wait, wait. So I''m keen to hear what Gabby thinks about this, because we''ve talked about it very much in terms of, like, games and platforms. But how do you think about it from, like, a community or, say, a guild perspective? So, for us, we organize the guilds, and we want these guilds to come in and contribute to the game communities that they''re part of, and get to own assets in the long term. Of course, there''s play to airdrop campaigns. Of course, people want to make money, right? But I think we really want to encourage people really coming in and then contributing to these communities, and then being able to earn from that. What do you mean by that, contributing? Because I know you''ve talked before about, like, the difference between community contributions versus, like, DeFi that is just perhaps extractors. So a lot of the roles we have in our community, of course, there are people who are players, right? But a lot of the people who are actually earning are content creators, they''re UGC, we have our YGG Esports team, who also creates a lot of content. And, for example, with our partnership with games like Parallel, we''ve done a lot of work to not only bring highly skilled players, create content around that, create visibility around it, and even create fandom around the game, right? And it''s that, and then we also happen to own assets in the game. So there''s really a real sense of contribution, and I''d like to think that''s what we want to do for games like Off The Grid as well. And Renz, like, from a fully on-chain perspective, like, do you think this is going to change? Like, if you''re, say, deploying an autonomous world and it becomes completely controlled by the DAO or the community, are you thinking about, like, token issuance in a completely different way? Or it''s the same? I don''t know. Right. Well, for us, we actually took inspiration from Second Life, right? Where, okay, a game may not be, you know, just like a game on its own, right? What if, like, a game eventually transformed into a world quite similar to this one, right? Except exists virtually. And then, like, jobs, all of these other jobs can exist, like, natively within, like, that world, right? Well, the Linden dollar was mainly a medium of exchange, though, right? Which is quite different to the way that people are thinking about tokens which are speculative. Right. So, I mean, what would happen then if, like, you are able to bridge, like, the off-chain from the on-chain world, right? And, you know, that''s why we were exploring, for example, like, a layer two on top of Fiverr Liquid because on-chain finance is supposedly there, right? And if on-chain liquidity is already there, if we are allowed to, you know, bridge this liquidity outside of the games into the games, right, and seamlessly allow that to flow, similar to, you know, for example, like, stock markets, right? Yeah. Like, then are we able to create that environment which allows these now digital worlds to seamlessly flow back into physical worlds and vice versa? And would that then be, or would we be forced to delineate between both worlds or discriminate against, like, one another, right? So those are the perspectives that we''re actually looking into as we actually journey through this on-chain environment. Yeah, I do think that virtual worlds have different goals than just games, per se. And they might look like the same thing but have slightly different goals. Of course, the problem of virtual worlds is that if they''re not fun, then they don''t get players in the first place. But I can see a world where there''s a lot more commerce transactions happening. There''s a lot more, like, virtual labor happening in a virtual world which may not necessarily be trying to be a game, right? I think there''s one very, very important component that most Web3 projects don''t take into account when discussing incentivizations and token economies. So within the very, very isolated Web3 kind of economy and Web3 community, I do agree with you that it is a very, very novel and interesting way to bootstrap an economy, to bootstrap an audience, to bootstrap a community. However, we currently, like I said, per DapRator''s report, hit an all-time high of active daily wallets of 10 million last summer. That was a 70% increase from Q1 2024 that DapRator attributed simply to just farming and airdrops and labeled as unsustainable. So what you have then is you have hundreds of thousands of projects, way more than we had in 2021, right? We have hundreds of thousands of projects selling and pitching and dumping tokens on the same roughly maybe 5, 6, 7 million at most daily active wallets. There''s a problem there. This is not sustainable. So the only way to make it sustainable is to bring in regular gamers. And a regular gamer, as soon as you start saying the first three sentences about incentivization, token, blah, blah, blah, like, phew, right? You lost them. Not to mention that prior to off-the-grid launching last October in early access, any time you would mention NFT or token in the context of a game, you''d get a hundred comments saying, scam, scam, scam, I will never touch this. That''s a narrative that we were able to change now with off-the-grid. Now, people are saying, well, like famous streamers would say, oh, why spend millions of dollars building a Steam marketplace when you can simply use blockchain technology? Or they''re like, oh, NFT''s not that bad. It''s like serialized Pokemon cards, very fireable and trackable on-chain. So we started changing the narrative. But the only reason we started changing the narrative and attracting regular folks to Web3 is because we do not lead with, oh, you''re going to get rich and you''re going to get tokens and you''re going to be incentivized and you''re going to be an evangelist, da-da-da, all that usual stuff, right? So you''re right. It is not black and white. And there is a use case for that. But any project that wants to get to 10 million daily active users and not a couple hundred thousand daily active users needs to embrace the mainstream. And the mainstream will absolutely not want to have any part of any of these things. That''s the problem. That''s why we need to strike a balance and make this approachable to folks and make this easy to use, make the blockchain and the earning component kind of move into the background. Having said that, I do fully agree that tokens allow you to share, quote unquote, the wealth with your community instead of it being this corporate black box, which is the old way of doing business, that there is a path forward where you do that in a very, very nice way. But I just simply think that the current models that Web3 has explored are not it. They''re it for the very, very small, very techie community, but they''re not it for bringing the next 100 million people to Web3. I have a question for you, Theo. Do you segregate between the potential millions of users of off the grid versus the people who will be interacting with the Web3 components, the people who will be looking at the NFTs and the token in your ecosystem? Great point. To some degree, there is a natural separation, but there''s also, of course, a lot of crossover. A regular gamer, for example, will more likely than not never interact with our 10,000 validator nodes that mint all the in-game items. So for those that don''t know, we have our game, we have our blockchain, and then we have 10,000 kind of distributed, decentralized nodes that mint every single in-game item. And the gamer pays those validator nodes directly for the process of minting the in-game item. That''s where we see a lot of, of course, Web3 interaction, a lot of excitement, and people interacting directly with launching components, tokens, NFT nodes, et cetera. On the gaming side, absolutely not. Like, we have traditional gamers that in the chat when people in our disco chat, when people bring up tokens, they''re like, I don''t care. Like, I don''t care about any of that stuff. I''m playing this game because it''s better than Call of Duty. And that''s really the reaction we want. Go ahead. It''s all music to my ears. Actually, we don''t see something different. Like, at the Blockchain Game Alliance, we try to showcase actual good games that are fun and bring players with all the things abstracted, hidden, and so on behind. The benefit comes later. One thing I want to say about, like, the topic playing for the future, like, any game that want to prepare itself for the future has to think of itself, like, how do I evolve from being a single game into being a full platform? One of the ways is user-generated content. Players being able to contribute with their own character, their own level, their own modes, et cetera, will evolve those games from... And will turn them into, like, digital nations, I would say. And that those that can live for a decade or even more, they will have, like, contribution, they will have differentiated gameplay, and at some point, they will have a form of economy that ideally should not be centralized and controlled only by the developer of the platform. And hopefully, Blockchain and Web3 is a good solution for that. But it''s a step-by-step process. I think if we look this year, what game can fit that, GTA 6 is on track to become that next big game turning to a huge platform. But we''ve seen platforms like Overwolf. They paid $240 million this year, about 2024, to creators who contributed modding games like Sims, like GTA 5, and so on. And we''ve seen the Minecraft economy and everything it had enabled because it allowed the players to actually run their own servers, make their own rules, change the gameplay, the core gameplay. I think we need that, and Web3 supports that in many aspects. Okay. I''ve got a quick question for Renz, which is following on from what we''ve just been talking about. And after that, we''re going to open up to the audience. So if you do have a question, please put up your hand. We''ve got a runner who will come around with a microphone so that you can ask the panel a question. But just following on from what we were chatting about here, Renz, I feel like you''re in between a rock and a hard place because one of the biggest criticisms about fully on-chain games is that they''re clunky, slow, very hard to play, very technical, because you are really leaning into that decentralised aspect. Now, it''s no secret that I love that because I think that''s where we''re going to see real innovation, you know, answer the question of why we''re putting Web3 in games at all. And what can blockchain do that we''ve never seen before in games? But your DAU is like basically zero. So like, how are you thinking about that? You know, where do you think this is going to go this year? Right. We''re actually quite like deep into the tech. For example, like Lattice just recently developed this quarry, right, which allows for real-time gaming. So we''ve actually tested out during DEFCON that you''re able to do like a first-person shooter without having to like click every single button every single time you actually try to fire. Wow. So, well, I''m not shilling it. I mean, like, I think the tech is improving, right? Like, for sure, I would say it''s less about like, hey, it''s about like the on-chain-ness, but it''s really more about like the UI, right? Like what kind of like user experience do we actually want to go? Like we can eventually design, or at least I believe, right, like we can eventually design like a fully on-chain game where a lot of these logic, a lot of these states are on-chain without having to go through like the barriers or the blockers that are currently hindering us from being able to do so, right? And if we were to compare like the current state, yeah, sure, like your DEU is going to go to zero, right? But that''s why we''re not like, I mean, that''s why we''re also not there yet, right? Because we know what to do. We know what infrastructure to build. But we don''t have the right technology or we don''t have the right, I would say like process that we did in the past as well to be able to achieve that right now. So I''d say like we already have like a lot of the foundation set up for us. It''s just a matter of like really pushing through it. And again, it may not be the future, right? Or it may not be the future for everyone, but it is an alternative, right? And for us, when we were thinking about like the gaming industry, and it''s not just Web3 that''s actually losing faith in terms of like gaming as a whole, right? Like we see a lot of layoffs in terms of like the gaming sector, right? And so like we also know that, for example, one out of 12 Steam games have been doing like 200,000 in revenue, which is not even enough to cover their game costs, right? So there''s clearly a problem here, right? And what we''re trying to tackle here is that potentially if these permissionless composable worlds allow for these builders to contribute and co-build and co-create, right? There might be a path where we don''t have to reskin, recreate like, you know, games and push forward for innovation and development much faster and much cheaper, right? With the technology that we have at hand. So yeah. Yeah. Autonomous worlds now remind me of where NFTs were. 2017, 2018, Seth and I were here in Hong Kong trying to raise money for NFT projects. It was incredibly early. Nobody really understood it. And then maybe 2021, people started getting it and it started to matter. I think there''s a lot of innovation in autonomous worlds. It''s probably not ready for prime time yet, but I''m glad that innovation is happening. Sovereign''s reading the way because there will be a day wherein we''re going to see a lot of real cool things happening and we''ll see a lot of players come in there. We just don''t know when that moment will be, right? For NFTs, it took a few years and there were people who really believed in it, who were experimenting in it way before the money, the liquidity, VC interest came in. Yeah. And yeah, we remember those days really well, right? I do. I was about to point like the importance of experimentation. Yes. Like you''re literally playing with mechanics that will set some portion of new genre of games, new experiences that we haven''t seen yet. And that maybe that particular will not succeed. I don''t wish that for you, but it will be an important step to what like the next big success from the takeaways we''ll take. And right now I see two major innovation on chain gaming and AI agenting gaming, not just trying to change the existing rules of gameplay, but really, really inventing new games that we haven''t tried. And well, maybe not all of the game will be successful. Maybe some will be so weird, so like freaky, but after the fifties try, one of them will emerge, will become the category leader. And we hope that it will pave the way for like the growth of the industry sector again. Yeah, it''s such an important space to watch and keep an eye on. All right, we only have about six minutes left. We have a question down the front here. We have a microphone down the front. So please tell us your name and your company and your question. Sure. Hi, my name is Alex. I lead gaming at Layer Zero. This is all music to my ears because I think I work with almost all of you. And I guess one question for all of you, if you could mention any specific milestone or maybe a set of events that will make Web3 Gaming as a category great again. One might say, was it ever great? But I''m just curious when you foresee the gaming sector, Web3 Gaming sector sort of blow up and explode in terms of the on-chain growth, in terms of the token performance, in terms of the actual play time and the play data. When do you foresee that happening in the mainstream adaption and why? It''s time for you to rattle off some stats. There we go. So yeah, so let''s start with the fact that since last October when we launched Early Access, we''ve amassed over 13 million wallets, over 280 million transactions, averaging 2.5 million transactions per day, and an average of 400 to 500,000 daily active users. And that''s just Early Access and we''re just getting started. So in my opinion, there''s several key moments that need to take place in order for mass adoption to happen. Number one, a project like Off The Grid hitting 100 million gamers will hit the radar of every single major gaming studio out there that then is going to start thinking, hold on a second, like maybe there''s something there. And then users are going to start driving adoption by saying, hey, we will simply not play games where we can''t own our own assets. We will have then major studios saying, oh, we were always talking about asset ownership and start embracing NFT technology and blockchain technology. So I think that''s one very, very important part. And on the other side of the Web3 fence, you will see projects saying, wow, this really worked. Like Off The Grid is onboarding tens and tens of millions of gamers. Let us also focus on this different way of building in Web3 and then onboarding massive amounts of game. I think those are the two main kind of trigger points that will make mainstream adoption happen. Well, I think like gaming is really broad in the categories of games. So like you see here, like Godzilla success and it''s fantastic. It''s appealing to a lot of AAA and bigger game studio. At the same time, like we''ve seen like it only needs one game on one particular platform or chain to succeed to drive a whole industry. It happened with X-Infinity. It happened with Telegram games. Like no matter how people might like or dislike Amster Combat, it led to a growth of a big sector and brought hundreds of millions of users to play games on these devices and enjoy transacting, etc. And those games, because we''ve seen it before in the industry of the gaming industry, specifically with mobile gaming. They seem a stupid game, either clicker, casual or hyper casual. Very soon, like the industry will professionalize, mid-core game will appear, we''ll have meta gameplay, we''ll have better graphics, and all of that will come. And actually, it''s already coming at a, I would say, 10 times faster than what we saw before in the mobile gaming industry. So by this year or next year, we''ll have great Telegram game with much better retention loop monetization. And the access to the distribution network that Telegram represents has been a massive catalyst for that. And I think like we''re going to continue seeing innovation with virtuals and everything of AI agent protocol as well that can accelerate gaming and adoption as well. So, yeah. Gabby Renz, did you want to add to that? Or should we take another question from the audience? We can take another question. Any more questions? Yes. Sir, over here has a question. Please tell us your name and your company and your question. Yeah, hi, I''m Anthony from Talent. I know nothing about the Web3 space, so I''m just here trying to learn. So maybe I''m one of those mainstream gaming people. Welcome. Do you see any roadblocks in the regulatory space around NFT? And just while you were talking, I just had an idea, like if your game is linked to NFT or NFT or blockchain ownership, what happens if the ownership changes mid-game? How do you deal with that? Yes, I''ll jump in. There''s two different things here. Number one, on the regulatory side, I believe we are getting to a point where more and more common sense regulation is happening across the board all over the world. And so, obviously, my personal recommendation is for games to get familiar with what regulation is and comply with those regulations. It''s going to make it a lot easier for the whole industry. But your second point in regards to, I believe you said, if ownership changes of the company, what happens to those assets? Well, obviously, if a project decides to completely just shut down, then you have pretty pictures and you do with them what you will. But provided that that does not happen, right, you have assets that you can trade before, you know, you, let''s say, leave a project or a game. In my case, my personal experience was I have two boys. They played a bunch of Fortnite. They spent a couple thousand dollars of their own hard earned cash on in-game items. And then when they inevitably moved on to a different game, they were like, hey, Dad, how do I get my money back? And I''m like, you don''t. They''re like, what do you mean? I mean, I think, for kids these days, it''s totally normal to own digital assets, but they were flabbergasted that they couldn''t actually sell these items. So that''s the more normal traditional use case, right? You move on to a different game or you have three of a specific object that you extracted from the game. You sell two, you keep one, you buy something else. That type of interaction is really what the NFT use case is most applicable for currently. I agree on the second part, 100%. On the first part, I tend to disagree. I think, like, even though it''s important to provide, like, safety for users, gaming is first and foremost a sector of fun and entertainment. And imposing regulation to what the first dollar spent by a user on an NFT is like buzz killer. Like, nobody wants to do a KYC and verification as soon as you spend your first dollar to an in-app purchase. And certain countries are taking this too seriously, imposing age verification, user spending caps, controlling how much they spend and how much they can earn with every NFT. That''s what happened in Japan. That''s what is bound to happen in France. This will put those countries lagging behind under adoption of the technology and allowing the players of their country to learn what''s like decentralization, web-free and like decentralized finance can be skilled through gaming versus others that are more broadly thinking and open about that. Oh, I agree with you. But I just don''t want these projects to get sued into the ground because they didn''t comply with regulations. Well, I''m fine to contribute and give my opinion about that. And represent the BGA as well to support our industry on that topic. Guys, we''re out of time, sadly. But I just want to thank you so much for this fantastic conversation. I think what we''ve learned is that you''re not actually all completely at odds with each other. I think decentralization exists on a spectrum and there''s many different ways to tackle it. And what that shows us is how the web 3 gaming industry is evolving. There really is something for everyone and so many different ways to tackle it and make it real to you. So thank you guys for sharing your insights. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks everybody for coming. Thank you. Thanks everybody for coming.', 'I''m very excited for this panel because it is an absolutely banger lineup.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('powering_the_future_of_ai_with_userowned_data', 'Powering the Future of AI with User-Owned Data', '未知講者', ' Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Anna, the creator of Vana Protocol, which is a way for users to own their data. Just to get a sense, are people coming from an AI background or crypto background? Okay. Maybe more crypto. Okay. Cool. So I will be talking a little bit from kind of an AI research perspective about the role that data plays in AI. And then I will be going into some of the inner workings of how the Vana Protocol works. Some of the interesting mechanisms we will talk about are data tokens, which basically act as this way to tokenize a specific data set. So AI models are ultimately really only as good as their training data. So if you''ve posted on Reddit, you''ve already helped to contribute to AI models. This data set is basically showing kind of what GPT-3 and a lot of the large language models are trained on today. But it represents a very small percent of the overall internet. So people estimate that that''s less than like 0.1% of all of the data that''s available. The reason why this matters is that if you want to build better AI, you need access to more and more data. So if you''re following kind of in the AI research community today, there''s a discussion of the data wall. What the data wall refers to is the fact that we''re actually running out of data to train AI models on. So some of the leading AI models today, like Llama 3, are trained on around 15 trillion tokens, which is like a word. It''s not like crypto token. And that''s actually the size of the public internet. So we''ve essentially run out of data to train AI on. And if we want to make it better, we need to find some place to get that data. The data wall is an issue of both quality and quantity. I don''t know if people follow DeepSeq, the AI model that came out recently that was really high quality. One of the things that a lot of people don''t know about DeepSeq is that it actually overcame the data wall through quality. So what they did is they hired a team of PhDs to generate really high quality data. So they took these highly educated people and had them generate like math and coding data that they then used to kind of bootstrap the data set. If you want like a human analogy, you can think about an AI as like a kid that''s learning about the world and you''re giving it data to teach it better and better. So what DeepSeq did is they gave it really high quality textbooks. They got it really good teachers. And that''s why they were able to train it so efficiently. Companies have realized that this data piece is really important and really valuable, right? So Reddit is earning $200 million from selling data for AI training. Photo Bucket''s earning $1 to $2 an image. On the buy side, Apple is buying data for $50 million. My co-founder Art used to actually work selling data to big tech companies. And a lot of these contracts are not that public, but extremely large because you need this data to be able to train better models. As companies have realized my data is really valuable, what they''ve done is actually made the access to the data harder for other people to get. So like Stack Overflow and Reddit have changed their API policies saying, hey, nobody can access our data except us or if you pay us to train AI models on it. There''s one group that still has access to their data, which a lot of people don''t realize. So users legally own all of their data, right? If you have posted on a platform or have sent a message, that''s legally yours. In the same way that when you park your car in a parking lot, the parking lot doesn''t own your car, right? It''s still your car. They can''t just randomly take it for parts. That''s the same sort of legal framework with your data. Most users don''t realize this. And most companies that have your data don''t necessarily want you to realize this either. But you can always go to a platform and get a full copy of your data back. So like if you use Instagram, you can just Google like Instagram data export. They''ll give you everything. They''ll give you your images, your posts. They''ll also give you the AI labels that they put onto you. So one of the AI labels that they had put onto me is stressed but not depressed. And it''s actually like shocking what they have on you. So it''s just a fun activity to go get your data. So what this allows for is basically cutting through the walled gardens, right? A lot of people today, when you think about the data sets that companies have, they''re living inside of the walled gardens. But each user can go and take their own data back. So VANA is the self-sovereign data layer for AI. In terms of the core concepts that VANA runs on, the first is non-custodial data. So what VANA allows you to do is to manage access to your data just like your funds. So you sign a transaction and that is basically granting access to your data. The second piece is proof of contribution. So if all of us like exported our Telegram messages and pulled them together in some kind of privacy preserving way, the risk would be that one person could pretend to be like 100 people and then take control of the data set. So what proof of contribution does is it ensures that when a group of people is pooling their data, it is being verified and meets a quality standard. There are a bunch of different data dials across the ecosystem. So here are some of the projects. I''ll call out a few. YKYR is a Chrome extension where they''re basically collecting browsing data and trying to build decentralized Google Analytics. The auto DLP is started by a guy who used to work selling data in Web 2 and then saw the opportunity to kind of start these sorts of models. They''re one of the first DLPs who''s already commercializing a lot of their data set. So if you have a Tesla, you can earn from auto DLP. I think it''s like $3 a month per person or something like that. And the buyer on that side is actually using it to understand how car batteries degrade. So that''s just one example. Nowhere is a Google location data set. Each of these is their own team. Typically, a data dial team is maybe three to five people. We have an accelerator program for the different data dials helping people learn how to build valuable businesses around data. Something I''ll note, too, is that each data dial has its own data token and proof of contribution. So they have tokenomics designed specifically for their data set. A few of the data dials to highlight, one of them is the Reddit data dial. That''s one of the largest ones. There are 140,000 users who contributed their Reddit data into that one. And now they''ve trained a user-owned large language model. That large language model, because it''s mostly trained on, like, Reddit messages and comments, people have been joking that it''s just good at, like, shitposting. But it is kind of that foundation of being able to take data from a large group and then create a user-owned model. The other one I would call out is the 23andMe DAO. So if people are familiar with 23andMe, the company, basically you, like, mail in your DNA and then they give you kind of information about what you''re like. And usually people don''t do it for the purposes of giving 23andMe their data. And that kind of wasn''t why people had signed up. But 23andMe is kind of struggling from a financial perspective. And so now they''re kind of sitting, I think, around $75 million market cap at this point. And they might have to sell to a company that wants to buy that data set. So what the 23andMe DAO is trying to do is actually buy 23andMe outright and make it user-owned. The goal is not to sell the data set, but actually to block the sale of the data. So in terms of what data allows for, Vana allows for, is really keeping data private yet interoperable. So one of the challenges with working with data is what we call the double spend problem for data. So if I give you my data, how do I know that you haven''t, like, taken a copy of my data and used it, right? So what Vana allows for is running operations on a TEE on that data, both at the individual level or at the aggregate level, but only letting the outputs leave unencrypted, right? And this is a really important core primitive because without it, you cannot form a data market, right? If you have a place where, like, the economics can leak, so if I can take a copy of your data or I make it public in some way, then I have no reason to pay you for that data. So that privacy piece is extremely important. From a technical perspective, Vana is basically an L1 that can work with private data. Usually blockchains can''t do that because everything is public. And so that''s kind of the core primitive that we''ve added to turn data into an asset class. Something else I''ll mention about data on Vana is that it''s structured and quality checked. So each data DAO is basically defining their data schema. Here I have the data schema from sleep.fun where you can connect your sleep data in. And what''s nice about that is you know the format of data coming in so any developer can build on top of it. One application I think could be really cool to see with sleep.fun data is if you tied someone''s on-chain trading data or, like, Coinbase data, kind of token-holding data to their sleep, you could basically track, like, how well are token holders of different projects sleeping. And that''s a sort of application that is only possible with access to these sorts of data sets. What Vana does is really unlock data as a new asset class, right? I think one analogy here is a lot of companies that buy oil, they buy oil futures, right? Because it''s such an important input to what they do. What we''re starting to see is people buying, like, compute futures. That''s relatively early. But, I mean, if you''re burning, like, yeah, some of the AI companies burn a ton of money on compute. So it makes sense. And I think that data is that natural next step of this asset class, right? So you can have these different data primitives that are possible because you have this tokenization of data. In terms of the mechanics, like, I feel like the idea of kind of, like, data tokens sounds good at a high level, but often the details are very important. So I''ll actually walk through how a data token works. Each data set has its own data set specific token, which is created through a DLP. And a DLP stands for data liquidity pool. That''s a primitive on Vana, which informally is known as a data DAO. So if you''re already deep in Vana, you might know about that. And then when we contribute our data, so, like, if I add my telegram data in or email data in, I get back tokens in return after it''s verified. The number of data tokens I get back depends on the quality of my data, right? So in the case of Reddit, that one is based on the square root of your karma. If you have more karma, you have plausibly more valuable data. Some of the other ones reward everyone equally. Then when someone is accessing data, they buy and burn data tokens for access. On Vana, it''s done, like, 80% in the data token and 20% in the Vana native token for data access. The other thing that I''ll call out about data tokens is that you can build all sorts of data 5 primitives on top of these data tokens, right? So there are a couple of DEXs that basically let you trade these different data set tokens. There''s Flora.sh and Datadex on Vana. And then there''s even a way for AI agents to actually trade data. So someone recently built, like, an Eliza OS plugin where those AI agents can buy their own data and trade it. Something else I''ll mention about Vana is the DLP incentives, which are designed to accelerate data onboarding. So the top 16 DLPs by stake earn incentives for onboarding data. Actually, are people familiar with the Tau subnet tokenomics to some extent? Okay, nice. So, yeah, if you already know that, it''s actually somewhat similar. But essentially what you do is you have the top 16 data DAOs that are competing on a set of performance metrics in order to earn a share of emissions, right? And so if you have a lot of data access volume, data quality value, or amount state, then you''re able to kind of earn a share of those emissions. In terms of where the other side of that comes from, it''s the fact that our bet is that emission is worth the fee long term for the data being accessed in the system. One upcoming change I would call out is that right now the incentives go directly to the DLP creators. In an upgrade that is coming in Q2, there will be an automatic buy and burn mechanism to the data tokens, right? So essentially what that does is route those rewards into the data tokens for data contributors and anyone else who has participated. I added a few other data DAOs here. So one of them is MindDow. They''re focused on a mental health data set. One of them, too, that''s kind of interesting is Finquarium, where they have you connect in your centralized exchange trading history. This one has been interesting where I think they support right now Coinbase and Binance. So you can get kind of like trading data from those platforms that usually just stays within them. They''ve seen interest from other centralized exchanges on basically like understanding what is going on in their competitors. So that''s been an interesting dynamic to track. In terms of kind of getting started on Vana, this is pretty builder focused. But what you''re able to do is kind of pick a data source. So you don''t need anybody''s permission to start a data DAO. Because users own their data, you don''t have to go ask Spotify, hey, can I start a Spotify data? Data DAO, because the user is just getting their own data. Figure out how users will contribute. So every data DAO builds their own UI. In some cases, it''s a Chrome extension. In some cases, it''s a Telegram bot or kind of a web UI where you''re contributing your data. There''s a set of template smart contracts to deploy. The proof of contribution is implemented in Python. And then what you''re able to do is kind of launch, register your data DAO, and compete to get into the top 16. As I mentioned, like most of the teams are a few people. It takes a few weeks to build out. And you can create like a template data DAO in just a few days. So this is a relatively builder focused view of Vana. But happy to take any questions people might have. Okay. I''ll ask one question that I get sometimes is like, how does private data work on Vana? Like how are you actually putting, using a blockchain to interact with private data? The reason why that privacy piece is important is that if my data becomes public, I then can''t charge money for it. Right? You''ve kind of lost that privacy. It''s actually an economic question as well as a user adoption question, which is I don''t want to like put my iMessages somewhere where they could become public. So what Vana uses for this is a set of TEEs. And the data is only ever accessed inside of the TEEs. So the only place where you work with unencrypted data is in those TEEs. So that''s both at the individual level, like accessing my data, but also at the data DAO level. Yeah, that is like a pretty technical view. And I think this might be a little too technical, but I appreciate, yeah, you all joining today. So any other? Yeah, go ahead. Hi. So yes, you are provided somehow tools to build DAOs as well. So the core of the DAO is usually an incentive mechanism because you should incentivize people to participate in the DAO. If I want to use a DAO and I''m a general, you know, an individual who is not familiar with anything, do you provide a basic incentive mechanism that I can use as core of my DAO as well? Yeah. Yeah. So what you''re able to do as an end user participating in a data DAO is contribute your data and then get back a data token proportional to that. And as a user, you can choose to sell that data token if you just want kind of a one-off relationship, or you can choose to hold on to it if you want to be part of the DAO. I think that one thing I''ve seen in DAOs is that often, just more broadly than just data DAOs, you have a huge amount of attention comes towards a DAO, right? And a bunch of people get involved. And then a few months later, everyone kind of forgets about it, right? Which is like not working that well in a DAO context. But actually with a data DAO, because you have a large group of people who come in and contributed their data, even if you have a small group that stays around and is managing the data set, you''re still able to have a really functioning data DAO.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('predicting_media_success', 'Predicting Media Success', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' So let''s start off with quick introductions. I mean, Farouk, you''ve been here for the last hour, so you don''t really need too much introduction. Yeah, this is tired of me. Loxie, let''s dig into your background. Who are you? Yeah, I''m the CEO at Dastan, the parent company of Decrypt, Rug Radio, and now Myriad Markets. Farouk, you want to introduce yourself too? Because I know they saw you. I''m Farouk, president of Dastan, founder of Rug Radio, and we also happen to own Decrypt Media, Myriad Markets, DGENs, and Lucky Trader. So basically throughout the course of this conversation, I want to dig into Dastan in terms of what it''s trying to do with Web3 Media at large, and then of course we have to dig into Myriad, which is the latest product to launch. Yes, the baby. We have to get a baby together. And it''s very cute. So let''s start off with Dastan. So it all really kicked off with the merger between Decrypt and Rug Radio, and then now, as we said, we have Myriad Markets that''s entering the fold. What was the grand vision here? Like, what was the bird''s eye view ambition that you guys are basically going after? Loxie, why don''t we start with you? Go for it. Yeah, you know, a few years ago, when Farouk was building Rug Radio and the distribution model there originally, mostly social audio podcasting, he gave me a call and was curious if I wanted to help him build a next-generation media company. And the first thing that we talked about and both agreed on was the idea that Rug Radio, because that''s all we were at the time, needed to be a tech company that innovated and used emerging technology like blockchain and AI to innovate the media space, not just report on it. And so as we ended up becoming closer and closer to the team at Decrypt, we found an opportunity to combine our entity with their entity, because we all agreed on the same thing, that we needed to innovate and to create an opportunity to really change the value distribution cycle within media, so that instead of just extracting from consumers with advertising and farming their attention in their eyeballs, that we could realign the way that content creators, content consumers, and ultimately advertisers, sponsors of this content, would all share in the value distribution. So decentralized media has been a bit of a buzzword. It''s been around for the last few years. I think many have attempted it. Many have failed. So what is it about Distan that you think has that recipe for success? Yeah, I mean, decentralization in general is one of the biggest buzzwords in crypto. And it''s like, what does it mean, right? Like, decentralization is not anarchy. And also, communism never worked, to be honest. Right. And so we tried. Like, we went the whole rug down route. We created a decentralized autonomous organization until that hit a wall because you get so big at some point that just, you can''t run a big operation with, like, 10,000 people. That''s just impossible. You can give it a shot. You can see governments. That just doesn''t work, right? And so for us, decentralization, the way we approach it is giving the power to the people, right? So with Rug Radio, the way we started is I was creator 001, right? So Rug Radio was created after me. So I found Rug Radio as a creator, and I''m like, how do I empower other people to do exactly what I do, right? And to get to where I''m at with my voice, right? By creating my content, right? And so that''s how we approach the decentralized media aspect. For example, Dudu''s out there somewhere. I forget. He was hanging out around here in Puke Rainbow and Maeve, and there are creators in Asia, right? But they run the thing here. Like, they have, they''re so popular out in Asia, and they helped us build our own network here. Why and how? Because I empowered them to do so. We say, here, here''s the brand. We''re going to start Rug Radio. We''re going to create, like, one of the most powerful, you know, media brands in the industry. We''re going to work on empowering the brand, and you guys can just use this brand to your advantage as long as you respect the brand, right? So you got to keep that in line always, right? Keep proper brand ethos, proper brand etiquette, and have a North Star, and then other people do their thing without, like, telling them how to do it. Like, my biggest pet peeve as a creator was always people trying to own me or trying to tell me how to do my thing. No, I do my own thing. I know what I''m doing, and I''m good at it. And so by allowing other creators to do so in a decentralized manner without telling them what to do with their content or what sponsors to take or trying to eat from their cake is letting them run with their own thing. And so that''s how we kind of approach the whole, like, decentralized thing. Now, from a purist standpoint, it may not go the way Bitcoin did, right? But I truly believe that decentralized media in that sense made sense, and that''s how we''ve always approached it on the Rug Radio level. So the principle underpinning all of that is that decentralization is a spectrum. It''s not the be-all and end-all, nor is it a binary where you are either decentralized or you''re not decentralized. So it''s about being able to provide brands the autonomy they require, the voice they require, and also the product that they actually want to deliver without this top-down over-regimenting it. Exactly. Which is what makes, you know, Web3 media so compelling because if we were to compare it to conventional media, traditional media, many people lack trust in that domain. In many respects, traditional media is broken. So what is it that new platforms like or new collectives like Distan are trying to fix out of that broken model? Ultimately, it comes down to incentive alignment, right? And when you look at, like, decentralization, what makes a group of people disagree or someone run amok, right? And people eventually resort to anarchy and, for lack of a better word, violence. Like, none of us are out here with, you know, with spears in the Web3 trenches, you know, jabbing each other. But in some ways, we are, right? And it''s when you can get a group of people together and understand the vision and align incentives so that we have fair distribution mechanisms, then we can live together peacefully, right? We can coexist. And so looking at media from that lens and that perspective, it was how do we take the traditional models that really incentivized the different parties and there was a lot of inequity in the way that the value was redistributed? And how do we re-envision that to a point where the people who are contributing to the content, both in terms of consumption and creation, feel like they are valued in the cycle versus just continuing to create and consume and being taken advantage of? And one of the analogies that I give a lot and I''ve done in front of crowds is ask people, how many of you have contributed to the content machine that is social media? And when I ask whether, you know, whether from the perspective of, you know, how many of you have tweeted, how many of you have posted on Instagram, everyone raised their hand, they''ve all fed the machine, right? Then you ask the second question, how many of you feel like you have been fed by that machine? And all of the hands generally go down with the exception of a few who may have had a brand sponsorship deal or feel like social media somehow or another or the media machine enriched their life, but it''s not common. And so our primary imperative, our job is to say, how do we fix this core fundamental problem where platforms like Google and Facebook, or meta now, I guess, right, extract so much of the value from the core contributors? And that''s really the driving ethos behind the technologies that we''re building. So then if we were to basically take social media, user generated content, and then we were also to take conventional traditional media, and then we''re to introduce principles of decentralization, incentive alignment, what we''re looking at is quite a bit of fragmentation. So how do we make sure that we are not only aligning incentives, but we''re making sure that everyone is covered, or who are we focusing on when we talk about aligning incentives? I mean, it''s from the brand to the creator to the network participant, right? I think the person who''s gotten the least amount of value from media is the reader, and it should start from there. It''s supposed to be top down, right? Like, at the end of the day, that''s the reason why Zuckerberg''s a billionaire, and the rest are not. Good for him. He built a great business. I''m a fan. But, you know, but I don''t think it''s fair that the basic reader, all we got is brain rot. You know what I mean? Like, the average person does this all day long, and there''s actually zero value. It goes back to you. Now, hey, I like to consume a little bit of content, too, sometimes. I like my watches. I like watching, you know, videos of cars online when I need to maybe shut the brain off. But at the end of the day, there''s absolutely zero freaking value that you''re getting from it, and you''re actually, like, it''s actually pretty unhealthy. It''s like eating McDonald''s three times a day, but you''re doing it all day long. Do you guys eat McDonald''s every day? No, you don''t. But you do it on social media with your brain, right? It''s even worse. And so I think that it''s very important to align all the incentives from every single standpoint, right? So creators are the fuel that makes social media great. People can hit on creators all they want, whatever they want, but without creators, you have nothing to consume at all. You have no content. There''s nothing, right? And so whether it be, I don''t know, cooking videos or what I do with my morning show, I think we provide a lot of value to the industry by bringing the news every morning to people. We''re at Coindesk, I''m at the Coindesk, we''re at the journalists over at The Crypt. But at the end of the day, again, the network participant gets absolutely nothing. And even in crypto, from a food chain perspective, the last person that becomes exit liquidity is always the freaking participant, right? It starts with the founders, down to the creators that always make sure to eat their cake. And then the participant that always gets wrecked, almost 99.99% of the time. So I think that genuinely, I think we''re going to get there in a secular myriad, is a good way to align these incentives from the bottom back up, where the participant actually gets a piece out of it, gets to put the reputation on chain, gets to participate within the network, and gets a piece of that network back to it. Then the creator that is empowered by the participant, and then, of course, the people that are responsible for it all. So it''s about creating a better system of symbiosis. Yeah, flip it upside down. Right. It''s a circle, but the thing''s got to be flipped upside down a little bit. So taking it from something that''s quite traditionally extractive to something that''s a bit more reciprocal. Yeah. It''s tough. Look, it''s not like we''ve figured it out, right? Lux and I are trying. Nobody''s figured it out, or else it''d be trillionaires, right? But I think at some point we''ll get there. I think we''ll figure it out at some point. But something needs to change, because the way this model has been going on forever is just useless. Like, I was a creator my whole life. I''m only 30 years old, but, like, I started the social media thing when I was 11, because I was bored in school. And at 14, I started my first blog. And then, like, 10 years in, I''m like, dude, what am I doing? Like, I''m just feeding a machine or feeding people content, but I''m kind of, like, responsible. Like, what I was telling you guys, like, I''m kind of responsible for it. I''m like, I''m the one, you know, pumping all that content out that people are consuming all day long. I''m getting tens of millions of views. Like, I was doing billion impressions a month across my channels. But even as a creator, I was getting near nothing in terms of money. And I''m like, these guys are billionaires. I''m here trying to make enough money to put food on my table, right? So something''s going to change somewhere. So we''re very aware there''s a problem. We''re not 100% clear on how to fix it. But obviously, Dustan is that endeavor into fixing it. So if we were to project, let''s say, three years into the future, what are going to be the things that define success for Dustan? Yeah, I think people will find within our media properties, they''ll find that more often than not, they won''t be served ads, but rather served opportunities to participate in the content funnel, right? And that''s the biggest thing, right? It''s giving people, like you mentioned, a reciprocal environment. Instead of treating the consumer like the product and trying to extract from them, how do we get them to participate in the creation of the news cycle and help us find sources of truth? And then, of course, reward them and incentivize them for doing that. I mean, it''s an entirely different paradigm. So what will it take for those users who are used to this extractive relationship to reposition themselves to be more receptive to this more reciprocal environment? Yeah, actually, I think that''s the smallest of all the barriers that we face. When you give somebody an opportunity to participate in something like a prediction market, right? And with us, the transition of our product went from just media into media with integrated prediction markets and prediction contracts. When you give people the ability to participate, everybody, not everybody, people generally want to share their opinion. And we are seeing right now, just strictly speaking on the numbers, that over 50,000 people as of today are participating daily in registering their opinions through our prediction contracts on Decrypt and in Rug Radio and in some various other channels that we''re distributing. There is no incentive for them to do it either right now. There is no real money markets that are live, so people are not betting and gambling. There is no payout, there''s no financial incentive. We''ve just given people the ability to play this game where they can register their opinion. And over 370,000 accounts have signed up on Myriad now with, again, about 50,000 daily active users. So I always liken prediction markets to sort of like monetizing the content, like the comment section of a social media grid. It''s giving people the opportunity to not only have their voice heard, but it''s in the same way where if you were to comment on an Instagram post and then whoever gets the most liked comment has that little bit of reward, they feel that, I guess, that validation. So that''s almost financializing. A little bit of dopamine. Yeah, we get that little dopamine here. But now with Myriad Markets, you get a little payout as well. So the first question in terms of really digging into Myriad Markets is, why was this the natural extension of a media-born product? Why is a prediction market sort of this next iteration? Why go there? I mean, to me, it just makes sense. The best example is what recently happened with the elections in the United States, right? Mainstream media had Kamala Harris winning, and it was like landslide. If you read any of the U.S. newspapers, like, oh, my God, Kamala''s winning for sure. Kamala''s winning for sure. But if you were in crypto, it''s like we saw the future, right? Anybody in crypto knew Trump was winning. Why? Because of Polymarket, right? On Polymarket, they had Trump winning by landslide, I think, what, months before? As a matter of fact, the day of the election, you told me that. It was nine hours before actually Myriad was launched and just no money markets. Had Trump winning, right? And so did Polymarket. We had a definitive outcome. Nine hours before CNN announced it, definitively, we were at 99%. 99.9% definitive that Trump had won. Yet if you were watching CNN the day before, you''d think Kamala Harris would have won, right? Correct. So regardless of your opinion, my opinion, his opinion on Kamala and Trump, it''s beyond that, right? It''s bigger than that. Prediction markets had it. Prediction markets were right. They were actually the biggest winner after Trump of the election was prediction markets, right? And I think it''s really important for the people to be able to consume the content different ways, like we were just talking about, right? There''s creators like myself. There''s the morning show. Some people like to consume the content like that. They like the podcasting, right? And clearly podcasters played a very important role in this last election. Like, you know, I got to interview Trump. The Nelk boys, all these guys, you know, it played. I think there was a new age in media. There was a very big cultural paradigm shift that really shocked the world, right? Then you have proper journalists, right? Coindesk. We own the crypt. We''re very proud of that. Very, very proud of that, actually. Because, you know, it''s investigative journalism. It''s good work. They research everything. You can trust them, right? At least you''re supposed to be able to trust journalists, right? And they write good content. But where''s the missing piece? Again, when we''re talking about misaligned incentives, it''s the people. It''s you guys. It''s what we think. And you want to be able to consume that too, right? So you go on my show. You listen to the show. I could be talking a whole bunch of shit and maybe I''m wrong. But the way you can see I''m wrong is because you can see what the people feel and think in real time through prediction markets, right? You could be reading an article on The Crypt and you''re like, wait, this is not right. This is not the truth. But the prediction market will tell you what the truth is. Now, I don''t really... Shane Copeland likes to say that prediction markets are the source of truth. I actually disagree. I think prediction markets are a source of truth, right? They can be. And it''s just a perfect thing for us. I mean, I know you should dive a little deeper into this, Locke. But it''s just like now we have the best of all worlds, right? You have your creators, you have your journalists, and you have the voice of the people. Really quickly. Marissa and I were actually just talking about this. prediction markets are ultimately, they aren''t necessarily a source of truth even. It''s just consumer sentiment aggregation, right? You can have every person in the world believe something that is wrong in those charts. If they believe this and they are willing to participate in the market, those charts are going to move in the direction that make it look like it''s definitive truth. It doesn''t mean it''s truth. It is just consumer sentiment aggregation, which means that it can inform the way that we report on news. And it can ultimately inform the potential outcome and influence the way that the world moves, right? But yeah, it''s very important to distinguish that that''s a difference, that there are two sides of this. There is actual context and nuance and journalism that is required. And then you can almost think of prediction markets like Community Notes 2.0. So then why do you think there is such a gap between the truth that traditional media is putting out there, like the journalistic truth that many come to receive, like are at the passive end of, versus this popular opinion being this other indicator, the secondary indicator of truth? Because, I mean, to the novice, it''s going to become very confusing to navigate the media landscape because you don''t know who''s telling the truth if people are saying too many different things. I mean, I''ve said this like six times now, unfortunately. It gets super boring when I repeat myself. Incentive mechanisms. Like, think about it. Every single media company. Everything''s the incentive mechanism. Everything''s the incentive mechanism. It''s all around the incentive mechanism. They say follow the money. Every single media company is owned by somebody, which is funded by somebody. And they all have to survive, usually on digital advertising, which comes from somebody. Now, all of those somebodies out there in the world, what is their bias? What is their intent? What are they pressuring? What do they want to be reported? What kind of impact does true journalism have on the externalities, the incentives that they have to live with on a daily basis? Whether it''s money that comes from the pharmaceutical industry or money that comes from political pacts or money that comes from anywhere. So, in a way, everything is politicized. There''s bias in everything. Right. There''s bias in everything. It''s super cringe. Like, after I did the Trump interview, every single, like, major... Well, first of all, they shut down my Instagram and my YouTube page, like, two days after. We got them back, thankfully. And second of all, every single large media organization reached out to me. All of them. Like, BBC. Like, everyone you can name. And they all tried to trick me into saying shit I didn''t want to say. And that really pissed me the fuck off. Pardon my French. But, like, it pissed me off because these are media outlets that, as a kid, I grew up watching and I dreamed of being on. And now that I''m the one on it, and I''m like, I don''t want to be here. And it shouldn''t be like that. So, there is this element of, like, developing systems that restore trust. Exactly. But incentives, again, become quite a tricky thing because incentives do exist within traditional media as well. Of course they do. That''s how we have a business to run. Yeah. Right? Like, how do we... Let''s be honest. Like, how do we end up here? It''s because you''re sponsors. Yeah. You need the sponsors. So, it leads to a much bigger question, which is prediction markets are a very nascent part of this space. So, there are going to be a lot of trial and errors. There''s going to be a lot of experimentation. And what it means is, like, how do we develop mechanisms that create safeguards so that this dynamic or, like, this doesn''t run away from us. This doesn''t become, you know, another meme coin craze where people just want to place bets because they can. And also, to your point, if you reflect popularized opinion, you can cash out at any point. You don''t actually have to be correct to make a lot of money in a prediction market. Correct. If you cash out on the fact that your opinion is popular. So, again, when it comes to this tricky dynamic it has with the pursuit of truth and what''s going to help keep people informed, how do you weigh truth against this incentive mechanism? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, ultimately, we have to remember that there''s three sides to every story, right? There''s his side and her side and the truth. And ultimately, who''s to say what is what? Perspective is really everything, right? And it''ll affect the way that people communicate, the way that they receive information, the way that they place their predictions. What we cannot do is we cannot say that we are creating prediction markets as a new class of DeFi product, which it is, as a mechanism that is a definitive source of truth. Anybody who tells you that is telling you a lie. Okay. We are collecting consumer sentiment, right? It''s consumer sentiment aggregation, like I mentioned before. And that''s it. And what that can do is that can help us dispel potential false information, potential false rumors. But what it can also do is it can also sway us into believing something is true when it''s not true, right? And so it''s important that we protect journalism because there''s an extremely important tool there in journalism. And it''s important that we approach everything with a level of skepticism, especially when there are financial incentives. However, it never hurts to have more information. And so when we look at today versus 20 years ago, where prediction markets are now a viable mechanism to say, what do millions of people believe? Versus before where we were stuck to maybe just a few simple outlets as a source of information, then we''re able to really determine, okay, do we have a full set of information to make decisions or to inform our opinions? So in that regard, you could almost consider prediction markets as having a fundamental social good. Like there is a component of this that really drives whether it''s incentivizing or empowering the reader or the consumer to actually be able to place value on the opinions that they share, as well as encouraging better media literacy because obviously you''re going to make place bets on what you feel most and best informed on. But what are the challenges here? Like what are the things that you need to hedge yourselves against as this scales? I mean, really, there''s opportunity for corruption anywhere, right? We don''t want markets to become corrupted. We don''t want people to, again, to create or to find false incentives and to be able to make monetary gain. The way that we prevent against that is largely network effect. The more people that are using the platform and the more socially integrated that it is, the less likely we are to have those types of attacks. You know, and then really some of the other hurdles really come down to the traditional issues that plague all DeFi products, but particularly prediction markets, which is liquidity, right? You know, there''s a world where it becomes extremely challenging to provide a great user experience, just like any other DeFi product. If there is not enough liquidity, both in terms of financial and opinion, information liquidity in the market, then you end up with very uninteresting, very dry and potentially very volatile environments, right? That just lend themselves to creating just a worsening and worsening consumer experience. So, yeah. And I guess the other challenge that cannot be ignored is that Web3, whether we like it or not, and despite the scale of this convention, is still a pretty niche space. Yeah. So when it comes to the people who are participating in these prediction markets, there is a natural bias or we haven''t hit a natural critical mass to make sure that there is enough diversity of thought within this space for a prediction market to yield the best result time and time again. So what''s the move to get there? Well, I''ll let Farouk tell you about it, but for us, it was called Abstract. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that''s why we launched on Abstract, blockchain, shout out to Lucanets and what they''re doing over at Pudgy Penguins. I mean, look, like, one thing we''re good at is being everywhere, making noise, getting millions and millions and millions of views, and now converting them to users. For me, like, I don''t even see it as a challenge to what I''ve done my whole life. Like, it''s fairly easy for me, and I think it''s very easy for us at this stage. I know Web3 is very niche, and you''re absolutely right, by the way. We''re still such a niche, and sadly, we''re a niche that loves building just for this niche. I have no interest to build for the crypto user. Like, we are crypto native. We''re the most proud crypto bros, whatever you want to call it, ever. I love it. I''ll scream it everywhere I go. But we have to learn how to build for users outside of consensus, right? And that''s super important, and that''s why production markets are great. You guys have always used polls before. Remember, when I was a kid, I was scrambling for cash. I was trying to do these things. You know when you do polls, you get $10 or whatever? Like, that''s where it started, right? And so there''s always going to be an appetite for polls. Like, you go on Instagram, you have polls. You go on any social platform, there''s a polling. So I think we just need to crack through that, and that''s it. Like, people won''t even realize they''re using the blockchain. Now, hopefully, people get to see what the blockchain is once they use it. Like, oh, fuck. Like, this thing is actually on-chain. Hey, let me read into it, right? There''s a token. Okay, cool. Let me see what this token does. But, you know, for us, like, I think the goal is just to keep pushing through, you know, mindful partnerships, mindful collaborations. Like, last year, actually, we came to Hong Kong for the first time, not for crypto, but for ComplexCon, right? ComplexCon is coming back to Hong Kong next month. Sick. Like, if you''re into fashion, streetwear, blah, blah, blah. Like, that''s, like, kind of the thing, right? And we were there on the main stage speaking at ComplexCon. So I think the goal is just to be able to crack through that and to be able to put our brands, our companies, our platforms to all, like, outside of the industry as much as we can. And I think Myriad is going to be a good champion for the space. And I think that people should cheer for us to win because, you know, the better we do, the better the industry does. And this is why you guys always see me cheering for everybody in the space because it''s, like, we need our winners, right? We need our winners to break through and to become number ones because, or else, people outside of our space are going to come and prey on us. So essentially, it''s tech abstraction, making it user-friendly, also making the content compelling enough for people to want to engage with, and the pathway into actually interacting on chain to be as seamless as possible and as incentivized as possible as well. So that everybody feels rewarded regardless of the side of the equation that they''re on. Amazing. It''s a lot. It is a lot. So Destin''s got a lot on its hands. I mean, it''s still a fairly new endeavor. It''s over a year old now. Yeah, so Rugredo is three years old. Their crypt is eight years old now. But the merger happened about a year ago. Is that right? Yeah, December 2023. So this is all very new. And Myriad is what? Three months? I don''t know. We launched beta in December. It''s already 200,000 people. But we''ll have 200 million people next time we talk. So stay tuned, everybody. Big things ahead. Honestly, Farrokh, thank you so much. Thank you, Marisau. I appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('protocol_village__aptos', 'Protocol Village_ Aptos', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hello. I know it''s a little bit quiet after lunch, but we''re time to get started. I''m excited to talk about next generation money movement on top of Aptos. And so if you think about crypto, it''s been used a lot for speculation, for also just kind of understanding how the technology can play a role in our lives. But what we started to think about at Aptos is, how is money movement going to really impact the next generation of crypto users going forward? And so the focus points for this particular talk are in three different areas. Trading, stablecoins, and real-world assets. And the reason why we focus on these particular aspects is because we believe that they bring the most value to users in the coming years. There''s a lot of utility to be had in terms of mass adoption of social integration with networks, with integration with even different kinds of creator platforms, as well as other opportunities for how every single internet protocol in the world today can leverage blockchain technology. But these are the focus points for us in the coming future, and we''ll kind of explain why. When it comes to trading, that''s, I think, what all high-performance chains aspire to. And so for those of you who have followed the success of both centralized and decentralized trading platforms, it''s clear that this is an important use case for every one of us going forward in the future. And for blockchains, we should be providing the best infrastructure possible for leveraging asset movement on every kind of exchange, whether it''s spot changes, perp exchanges, as well as other novel products around how we move these assets and we can actually interact with each other on this. And so from a blockchain perspective, what that means is when you think about our tick-to-trade times, what is the time when price information goes from around the world into the network and then being able to act upon that price change immediately, not with a delay of seconds or minutes, not with fees that are in the dollars or even tens of cents, that''s not scalable. If we compare it to today''s existing platforms, you have NASDAQ, you have the NYC, you have the London Stock Exchange, each of these platforms supports trillions of dollars of daily movement. And for this to happen in the blockchain space, it requires very, very high performance infrastructure, infrastructure that kind of rivals those products in market today. But it''s much more challenging for a decentralized infrastructure to do that. That computation is repeatable. It is something that requires a deep technical mind to solve. And for this, you know, it requires very, very low block times. Today, Aptos is the lowest block times in the market, as shown here. You have, you know, under 200 millisecond block times, much, much faster than everybody else out there. This allows us to react much faster. Traders can get the arbitrage opportunities, they can take advantage of the spreads between other decentralized infrastructure, they can even start to really compete with the centralized exchanges around today. And so for this, it really means a lot of deep technical innovation. One thing is, how do you kind of your consensus protocol operate at mass optimal consensus latency? For us, that''s three hops. One time for someone to propose a block, someone to vote on it, and the second time, the third time to confirm that transaction. One and a half network round trips. This means that if you have a sub 200 millisecond block time, it takes about 300 milliseconds or less for that trade to go through in today''s system. As we go down to under 100 milliseconds of block time, we''re talking about 150 milliseconds, which is a lot faster and starts to really rival that experience you see in centralized exchanges today. Another thing is, we don''t have to wait for those trades to happen. You see a price action, you want to act immediately upon it. You don''t have to wait those 150 milliseconds. And so for that, be able to support what we call event-driven transactions. It means you can submit your price feed action early and say, well, look, if Bitcoin moves over 100,000 today, I want to sell a little bit of Bitcoin. And as soon as that price action is discovered on chain, the infrastructure will then take advantage of your trade, execute upon it immediately, and not have to wait with any delay for that going forward. This is a very novel thing that''s going to be possible in the coming months on top of a system like Aptos. The third thing that''s important for trading infrastructure is what we call Aptos Intents. For those who''ve been following Intents, Intents is the idea that you can kind of put an open order on any blockchain like Aptos, and anyone can fill this order. So what it does essentially is turn the entire order book live for the network. Anyone can fill that order. Aggregators can fill it. You can have centralized exchanges filling it. You have decentralized exchanges filling it. Anybody can kind of take advantage of that. And that is a very powerful tool for aggregating liquidity access as well as orders into one place. The next is around stablecoins. And for move, it''s a new language. It''s something that we worked on at Facebook back in 2018, developed over time. We now have move to in Aptos. It''s something that''s been released, and we''ll talk about a little bit more later. But we''re very proud to say that both USDT and USDC are live on Aptos today. The only move chain with those both. And in terms of move stablecoins, you see about $839 million of stables now live on top of Aptos as well. We''re very excited to see as well other stables coming to Aptos. We''re the only L1 protocol working with the Hong Kong dollar today, just given we''re in Hong Kong, that would be appropriate to share. And we''re also in discussions about seeing other stables come on board, like AED out of the Middle East. The reason why we care a lot about money movement is because it''s very important for an economy to flourish, for trade to happen. And Aptos is the cheapest place for that money movement to occur. This is a screenshot of the gas fees now for money movement on USDT. And you can see that Aptos is 10 to 10,000 times cheaper than any other blockchains that are going to move money on. And this means you can do things that just aren''t possible in other networks. You can support microfinancing applications. I can loan you a dollar and you can pay me back in two cent increments, 50 times. And everything, that entire transaction flow is gonna be cheaper than a cent. The next thing is you can imagine a world where you pay for content. Today, there''s a subscription-based model. If I sign up for the Wall Street Journal or for the Times of India, I pay a flat fee for a period of time. And it''s just one article I might want to read. Instead, you could have a model where you pay a couple of cents for that article. That gets transacted on chain. That goes to the publisher. And now I don''t have to get a subscription for that. Now, it requires that very low cost of transaction so that these low costs of the articles are very feasible. It also requires a very scalable network. That''s something that Aptos does really, really well. The last use case we have for stablecoins is around decentralized physical infrastructure or deepin. Deepin networks are really about how do we kind of allow our shared resources to be used by others and being compensated for it. So whether it''s gonna be AI clusters being leveraged by certain software providers. It could be you using my wireless network or my wireless access. And in the back end, what''s happening is you have the payments infrastructure, very similar to the way you think about AWS or Google Cloud Services or Azure going forward. And so providing an infrastructure that supports that, an extremely very fine granular payment is really important. The last piece here is that even forget money movement for a second. If you think about things like loyalty programs, which are very, very low value transactions, they may even be, you know, subsets. You have to have a network that supports that very, very low cost in order for this to be very sustainable and work well for kind of this large scale applications of loyalty programs. The last area in this kind of bucket, the trilemma we call it, is gonna be RWAs. And RWAs is an asset class that''s gonna grow to $40 trillion by 2030. It is something that is being looked at very intensely by a number of large asset managers, as well as even those who are just looking to innovate in the space. We''ve been very excited to see that Apollo, BlackRock, Franklin Templeton, Brevin Howard are all issuing different kind of tokenized assets on top of Aptos. They''re experimenting, trying to understand the demand for these products and also how they would work in practice. Today, I think there''s more than a billion dollars of funds are tokenized on different products today. And we expect that number to grow extremely fast in the near future. We''re very excited to also set some industry standards. We work closely with BCG, who is, I think, only endorsed Aptos to date as a letter one protocol, as well as others like Invesco, again, a trillion dollar asset manager, to publish white papers explaining the value of tokenized assets, which are very helpful for places like Hong Kong and others in the world to rely on these studies to really push the narrative that these kind of asset classes coming on board are really important and are going to be very transformational for our industry going forward. On the other side of the spectrum, we see emerging markets being a huge factor in this space. We''re very excited to announce that PACT protocol is deployed on top of Aptos. It is a fully featured microfinancing program platform that allows loan origination, payments, warehousing, and security station fully on-chain. And this is a use case I think a lot of us are very, very passionate about. From my early days at Libra and Diem, a lot of it was about how do we support money movement in the emerging markets, that they don''t have access to the same kind of financial infrastructure we have today. And a protocol like PACT is actually supporting this mission very clearly. They support loans. I think more than a billion dollars of loans have been issued on PACT as of now to lots of small denominations, whether it''s $50, $100 loans, and those can be paid back at very fine granularity. It''s been a very long project, I think more than nine months of incubation, but we''re excited to see this kicking off. And many different retail partners are deploying loans on top of Aptos at very, very high rates. We expect this to grow drastically prior to the end of the year. Today, I think RWA to XYZ, we''re already fourth. Just with what PACT has done, we expect to be first by the end of the year in terms of those assets. The last thing is we expect that this kind of finances available today in these emerging markets will evolve far beyond microfinancing. You start with microfinancing, you pay back those folks, and then those folks start to distribute that money around using the native currency, which allows blockchain and crypto to grow very, very rapidly in these regions where it''s needed absolutely the most. Now, when we think about scale, Aptos is clearly the top here. One of the things we did recently is we ran a preview net with over 100 machines of our latest version of our software, and we wrote a benchmark showing that you could do 2 billion transactions in a single day. To put that into comparison points, Visa did 734 million transactions per day in 2023. MasterCard, 479 million. But what Aptos could do is actually support more transactions than all the credit card processors combined. And that kind of shows you that from a proof point, this technology is ready now. It''s not something that''s going to be coming in two years, five years, 10 years of line, or in 2030 with someone''s very long-term roadmap. This is something that''s achievable with existing technology now. The other thing is that you want to have a very fast user experience. When you look at the user latency, that is a time from when you kind of, say, load a website until that time is loaded. That''s the thing we care about the most. Aptos is clearly the fastest here. 850 milliseconds for a transaction. Once you build up your wallet, you transfer money in Petra to another user. It happens in sub-second finality. Now, the average website takes about two and a half seconds to load. At under 850 milliseconds, that means you can insert many different blockchain calls without impacting that experience one bit. It means that every single user website, every single application, whether it''s mobile or through web-based, can leverage blockchain without having to impact the user experience. And that''s really, really important for mass scale adoption. And this is not something we do in experimental and just in the field. Back in August of last year, we saw Aptos run a record 326 million transactions on mainnet in a single day. And that''s over 3,700 transactions per second, something that had never been achieved by any network before in the past. And with these numbers, what it showed you is the scale is runs in not just an experimental lab, but also in production today. Additionally, beyond that, it shows you that there was no failure rates and increases. There was no gasp increases. Everything worked perfectly fine. No users complained. No applications complained. And it showed you that even with very, very high load, the system could support that. So it''s kind of time for those big players who''ve been waiting to deploy with crypto and with Web3 to deploy in Aptos because it shows you that, you know, you don''t have to worry about the mission criticality of those operations not working when you need them absolutely the most. And it''s not just us that''s realizing this. We''ve been very happy to see the Electrical Capital Developer Report talking about some of the progress of the Aptos ecosystem growth over the last year. And right now, we are the second fastest Web3 growing ecosystem. We saw developer activity grow almost 100% from one quarter to the next. And over 1,000 new developers are choosing to build the future Web3 on Aptos. You know, a lot of people have wondered as well, the move is a new language. It''s different than Solidity. It''s different than, say, Solana''s Rust. How will it pick up? And what we''ve seen from developers, and I encourage you to talk to as many as you can, move is a great language to build in. Once you start building a move, it''s really hard to actually turn back to the old days. And the kind of reason for that is, for those of you who program, programming languages are something that I think has been overplayed a bit in terms of the difficulty from switching from one to the next. No programmer knows just a single language. Everyone knows at least three, four, or five different languages when it comes to writing code. And as you start to use these different languages, you understand the differences between one to the next. Move is something that was just built different. It''s built for Web3 development specifically. It''s built for the idea that if you make a bug and you make a mistake, you know it might cost somebody their entire life savings. Or it might cost, you know, a protocol like the, that might be the end of them going forward. It really reduces the idea that you can have bugs in your code. It won''t make it perfect, but it makes it harder. And that''s, I think, really, really important. And what we''ve seen is that as developers start to learn more about Move, they evangelize as well. They start to talk about the benefits of Move. And this is where we expect the development to grow to continue to happen as they start to play with the language. Let''s go through the innovation stack a little bit. The first thing to start off with is Move 2. Move 2 is a new take on top of Move. We''ve learned a lot from the developers in the past of building, building on the platform. I think more than 10,000 modules have been deployed on top of Aptos today. Now, what''s unique about that is that every single module that''s been deployed on top of Aptos is open source code. It''s compiled to Move by code. But there''s a Move decompiler which allows you to reverse engineer that code and come back with the source of it. All that code that''s been decompiled and resourced can then be put into, say, your favorite AI LLM model. You can use that model for actually training new developers to come in language. And I think this is where AI has really helped a lot of new developers to understand what Move can do as well as other programming languages in this space. Move 2 comes with so many different features. It is a fully complete developer platform. You have integrated specifications, formal verification, type inference, generics. Formal verification in a Move is really special. It comes with something called the Move Prover. The Move Prover allows you to write specifications into your program, which say, for example, you want to maintain the search in invariant. And that invariant could be a conservation of money. And it then will test every possible iteration of the inputs you have against the outputs. And so it''s a very, very strong, powerful testing tool that no other platform has available to it except for within Move. But we''ve got all the things you would like to have for programming languages, higher order functions, memory safety, by-equal verification. And most importantly, this language is upgradable. So as you deploy your module, if you want to make a change to it, there''s a way to do this where the code is kind of given to be API compatible. There''s a lot of testing places put in place. And people can kind of see that history of lineage of that module evolving from time to time to time, which gives a very nice traceability around the history of that code. If you want to reverse engineering those code changes, you can also then use a decompiler to undo that and then understand exactly what changes were made from one version to the next going forward. So let''s walk through some of the advantages from a programming perspective. We''ve thought a lot about how the syntax of the applications makes sense, how the functionality makes sense. And so here''s just one example of a big change for us, which is the method syntax and the next location. So prior to the changes, we had to kind of explicitly borrow this mutable object. Going forward, you can use the .syntax location. This cuts the code down by a lot, makes it a lot simpler, makes it look a lot more like the kind of Rust-based applications you''re used to developing in the past. Another one here is around enum types for versioning. So in the past, you kind of had these different structures. You set up data v1, you have data v2. And then in order to upgrade between these two paths, you kind of explicitly have to check the signer, the address. And this pattern itself is very unsafe, very complicated, easy to make mistakes on top of. In the new world, you can kind of specify this as enum as opposed to different structs. And this is very nice because then you can use the match statement like you would for any Rust code, for any enum, and kind of just operate the way you would expect to, depending on the different versions of that. Match is, of course, comprehensive. So it makes sure that you can''t make that kind of mistake you could in the previous statement. The next thing we''re going to talk about is the endgame of consensus. So one of the things that we have is a very strong research team. I think there are more than 25 PhDs on our team. And we have a lot of research we''ve done in the consensus space, which we use a lot of our time. So we started off, if you kind of go through the history, back in 1999, there was a protocol called PBFT that was invented, never implemented, but just invented and kind of research talked about. 20 years of research passed since then. And really, it''s been very hard for people to kind of even improve upon PBFT. But we have a number of things, Jolting protocol, we have Narwhal and Tusk, which is a very exciting one, Bullshark, Shoal, Shoal++. Now the Narwhal, Tusk, Bullshark, and Shoal++, all types are around this, what we call DAG-based computing. So DAG is a distributed acyclical graph. It kind of requires each node to put together its consensus protocol from each node. And so from the Aptos viewpoint, back in 2023, you deployed something called QuorumStore. QuorumStore is almost like a multi-leader type system. Any node in the value or set can receive transactions. It''s not a single leader. And each of those then broadcasts those transactions to other nodes, creating a proof of availability. This proof of availability is one of the key steps in terms of providing the data dissemination layer to scale out as many nodes and validators as you have. And the pipeline aspect of what Aptos has done provides a very unique infrastructure that kind of works very much like a modern-day Superscalar CPU. So in a modern Superscalar CPU, you kind of split up the phases of execution one by one by one. So you have instruction to fetch, decode, processing, maybe different ALU components, branch prediction, all that fun stuff. And those stages, you know, today it''s maybe 20, 30 stages, allows your CPU to get very, very high frequencies. It''s similar for us when you think about a processing pipeline for data infrastructure. And for us, it''s the data dissemination phase, it''s a consensus-based phase, parallel execution, parallel storage, as well as proof of certification. The end game of consensus though for us has been always in the database protocols. But going forward, we''ve got a new one coming called Raptor. And with Aptos already at the lowest latency possible in this space, Raptor will allow us to push the boundaries by even more, I think even by 15, 20%, especially in the cases in which nodes may not behave as best as possible. So we''re very excited to see this technology being pushed to Aptos probably this year. Raptor is going to be a huge revolution and we expect it to live for probably the next 25 to 30 years in this space. Many blockchains have to think about scalability and Aptos as a leader in parallelization is moving as much of the resources you can into production from the scalability aspect. And so if you kind of go back in the history of blockchain infrastructure, you start off with kind of EVM and Bitcoin where you have sequential execution. Sequential execution means that you''re operating and doing one transaction at a time. Even if your CPU has multiple threads, multiple cores, it''s still just one CPU, one execution at a time. The next phase of iteration was around static parallelism. This is things that like Solana do. You declare all your dependencies up front and you leverage a scheduler to then operate on those types of dependencies and assume that all those conflicts are going to happen and then try to parallelize as much as possible. The third thing is where we built out. It''s called dynamic parallelism around block STM. This has been a major shift in the way you think about programming for blockchains. It allows you to leverage as much parallelism as possible within your program without you, the programmer, having to specify a single thing in your code about what''s parallelizable and what''s not. So you can just kind of write your code like you normally would. Imagine you have a normal function you''re writing today in Python. You can go ahead and access global state. You can, you know, leverage whatever you want to do without having to kind of declare it up front. And then under the covers, you have this very, very smart runtime scheduler, which looks at your transaction, runs it in parallel, tries to evaluate what dependencies are read and written, and then leverage that infrastructure towards scheduling as many threads as you can at the same time. And this has been something that is a technique used, pioneered by Aptos, but now used in networks like Say, Monad, Polygon, StarkNet, and being adopted widely across the industry. And so we''re very excited to see that dynamic parallelism is something that is making its way throughout the blockchain space. But the question is, what''s next? And the thing that we''re excited to share is we''re working on block STMv2. Block STMv2 is the next generation software transactional memory scheduler that will help us to get to many, many more cores going forward. And so the way that hardware is evolving right now is that you''re seeing more cores per machine. You''re seeing multiple sockets of cores per machine. And we expect this to be, you know, 256 cores, 5-inch-inch cores, even in 1K cores, to be pretty common on commodity hardware in the near future. And what that requires is a very new algorithm, how you think about the parallelization piece, how you can build the components of dynamic parallelism into a very scalable system for the new generation of hardware. And so block STMv2 is getting close to getting released. We''re testing it right now. But the performance numbers are really, really promising. And we''re pretty excited to share that this is going to be something that allows us to get even beyond the parallelism we have available today. ZapToss is a new features paper we kind of wrote recently. The idea is we really want to minimize the blockchain-based latency for every system, our part of the system. And so just going back again, we''re talking about a paralyzed design. The design allows us to kind of do stage-by-stage optimization. ZapToss allows us to cut latency when you have very, very high throughput. So it''s common today to see a situation where if you have very high throughput in the network, the latency goes up a lot. And the way we solve this problem is by taking those stages of execution we have and overlapping them as much as possible. So rather than executing sequentially, you can try to do as many as you can at the same time. And what that shows is that even at that very high 20,000 transactions per second, you can still do it very sub-second. And that''s pretty exciting because as you think about what 20,000 transactions can support, that''s more than Twitter, that''s more than Facebook posts. And that scale allows you to really think about how a lot of the Web2 applications today can leverage blockchain into very core parts of their functionality. The way we do this is by taking those pipeline applications and then kind of shadowing the execution. The shadowing of execution that happens through the pipelining phase allows us to really compress the time into much shorter routes. And it''s something that we''re actually implementing today in the code. We expect this to be live and out to us mainnet in the coming months. The last piece I want to talk about is shardines. And shardines is the idea that, you know, today we have a very big shared state. That shared state allows us to all operate in the same kind of country. And that''s really important because others take a different sharding approach. They shard the state in different pieces. And then they have bridges between those pieces. And that bridging between those pieces means it''s very hard to compose applications that cross between each other. And we see this today in the L2 world for Ethereum, for example. Working between one L2 to the next, to the next, to the next across a bridge is a really poor user experience. And yes, it might get better over time as bridges get better or protocols get better. But by and large, it will never be a native experience. It will always be something that is going to be very, very different than operating within that kind of native L2 or that native state. And we really want to solve this problem by taking that same shared state and just expanding the pipe power behind it. How do we make that shared state operate in a sharded fashion? And the way we do that is not by sharding the state. We shard the validator itself. We take each validator and we start to break it up into multiple machines where each of those validators has many different execution shards going forward. The transactions themselves are then sent to the different shards. And you have a very fast, high-performing cluster within those validators, which processes chunks of these machinery, as well as then kind of does some storage updates, and finally passing by, aggregating the results, and putting them together. And what we''ve seen is that you can get more than 1 million transactions per second very easily. You can do more than 10 million transactions per second over time with scale. And you can do this by basically crossing off the dynamic partitioner and also a micro-bashing strategy. So we''re very, very excited about the work that Shardines is doing. And we think it shows that blockchains today are going to be very different blockchains to the future. We''re going to see blockchain scaling to all the biggest use cases out there. And if I want to leave you with a quote, Bill Gates had a very funny quote he made back in the day. He said, why would anyone need more than 640k of RAM going forward in the future? Imagine you had a million transactions per second and what they could do for you. Imagine the differences in the applications you could build, as well as the services that can be leveraged with blockchain. And that''s what we''re really, really excited about this going forward. So if we can wrap this up, I would say the focus points for us are around how do you support money movement at high velocity. There''s aspects around trading, around stablecoin movements, around the RWA assets going forward. And then what is technology required to make that shift happen? That technology shift is going to happen in terms of pushing the boundaries in terms of the throughputs, the latency aspects, as well as the costs. And the more we can continue to do this and push this down, we''re going to see very, very interesting products being built in this space going forward. And so with that, I think that concludes my talk. So thank you very much.', 'Hello.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('protocol_village__bnb', 'Protocol Village_ BNB', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hi, this is Sara from BMHN. Thank you for having me today. I''m the head of BMHN BD team. I''m really honored to be invited here today to introduce a bit about BMHN, what we are doing, what is our plan this year and next year, and so what is our metrics and focus in terms of devs, in terms of tech features in the coming years. So today I will spend around 40 minutes together with you guys to introduce a bit more about what is BMHN and what is our focus and priorities right now. So what is our mission? BMHN''s mission is to really onboard the next billions of users to WebStrike. By doing so, we''re really working closely with end users and developers to offer them whatever it is, is the tip, development tools, infras, or different kinds of DApps, including DeFi, AI, gaming, DeSol, DeScience, et cetera, to onboard users in a seamless institution''s way and also lower down the user''s barriers as much as possible as we can do. So by having these missions, we have done a lot in the past five years. I think everybody remember if you joined this industry back to five years ago, there is a DeFi summer back to 2020. At that time, BMHN got a really big hype. There''s a lot of people farming on BMHN DeFi protocol like Pancake, Throw Up, OneNest, and there''s also a lot of really interesting gaming projects that''s building there. So this year, we''re doing something new. I will introduce it later. But we''re keeping building and keeping growing to achieve our mission and our visions. So first of all, I wanted to start with some really, really interesting metrics on BMHN. I think everybody knows that we have three really important tech stocks, which is one is BMHN Smart Chain, which is the layer one protocol. It is also an EVM compatible chain, which means if you have solid contract on Ethereum or any other EVM chains, you can easily migrate to BMHN Smart Chain. And in terms of the metrics on BMHN Smart Chain, which has been successfully operated for over five years, some important data I wanted to highlight. One is about liquidity. Right now, BMHN Smart Chain is one of the top five TVL chains compared with all other layer one layer two protocols. So there is over 7.6 billion TVL assets that''s been already stacked on BMHN Smart Chains. And also we have another over 6 billion stablecoins circulated there. Those are USDT, USDC, FDUSD, and a lot of other yield-bearing stablecoins that''s circulated on BMHN chains. So if you are in assets issue, you wanted to really launch your assets and get your assets to a lot of liquidity supported there, BMHN Smart Chain will be the ideal place for you to choose to launch your assets. So any kind of asset, right? For example, meme coins, UT tokens, or even RWA assets, design tokens, et cetera. So for BMHN Smart Chain, we really want it to be the DeFi hub for any kind of assets and any kind of trading experiences or token launching platforms. Besides that, we are also one of really, really cheaper chains in terms of compared with all other layer one protocols. So the TPS on BSC is around like 5K, and we are going to increase that TPS this year a lot. And also the gas fee on BSC is now to 0.03 US-style pet transactions. So that''s already lower enough compared with other layer one protocols. So if you wanted to have secure and also have liquidity as I mentioned, you do really consider BMHN Smart Chain. But besides that, we also have a big user base. I think a lot of devs are choosing BMHN. One of the major reasons is because we have a large user base. On BMHN Smart Chain, we have over 500 million unique address, which means if you are really developing a solution that is playable for users, that is the user base you''re going to face up with. Can you imagine how many users you''re going to have once you launch something really useful, helpful, or even funny on BMHN? But besides BMHN Smart Chain, last year, or it''s actually two years ago, 2023, September, we launched in another solution called OP-BNB, which is the OP-Rollup building on top of BMHN Smart Chain. This is a layer two-slow solution that in the BMHN infrastructure. So this one, we''re dedicated ability for any type of high-frequency devs. For example, gaming, AI, diesel, designs, et cetera. So this year, we have saw that a lot of devs that is really requiring high-frequency interactions on chain have really migrated from BMHN Smart Chain to OP-BNB, or from other layer two to OP-BNB, just because the TPS here on OP-BNB is up to 5K to 10K, and the gas fee is now to 0.0001 US dollar per transactions. And also, OP-BNB has been also supported by a lot of, like, sexes. So if you have assets, for example, Binance or other sexes, you can easily withdraw your assets directly to OP-BNB. So you don''t need to have really using a decentralized bridge. You can just use the sex to be the bridge for your assets to micro-gate or to bridge to OP-BNB. That will be also easier, especially for Web2 users, to onboard them to this new chain. Actually, besides that, right, here is an overall more comprehensive one picture about what BNB ecosystem. So except BNB chain, which is including BSA and OP-BNB, as I mentioned, we also have a really important tech stock, which is BNB Greenfield. So this is also a really important tech stock we just launched, main, late, two years ago, back to 2023. It is a decentralized storage protocol dedicated for hot data, popular data, regular use data, instead of for cold data. So we think this is really critical in for us in this ecosystem, especially for any kind of data related or AI related applications. So there is a seamless bridges between Greenfield, Waze, OP-BNB, or BSC. So if you do want to make sure your data has been decentralized stored in a secure way, but also you want to have permission control over your data, then Greenfield will be the ideal solutions that''s been there. So you can have your smart contract to manage the permission of your data on BSC or OP-BNB, and you store your data on Greenfield in a very, very cheap way. So Greenfield launched BNB chain for less than two years, but there''s already a lot of AI projects or data or even DID project has already started to put their data on Greenfield. So you can track those informations on our website or database, so there''s a lot of data already there. But besides that, right, we also have run really interesting initiative that''s been started to dedicate it to secure or protect our end users and our dApps, which is AvengerDAO. We all know that during DeFi summers, there is a lot of rock pools and there''s a lot of risk for end users. If you wanted to really farm your tokens into some like staking pools, you always worried about if there''s any potential risk you''re going to face up with. So that''s why we started AvengerDAO together with a lot of security auditing firm in this space. So if we''re working with those top ones, then they will do automatic risk screen for the project that''s been developed or have smart control on BNB chains. So if there is any risk, we will put a red flag onto the projects on our website. So every people will be aware that this project will have potential risk. So when you want to really do interaction with those projects, you need to be really careful. So that''s an initiative that we are doing and we are putting a lot of effort into to just take care of our rate and the users'' wells and their assets. So that''s an asset concept of a one BNB. To be the technically ready is not good enough, actually. We still saw that there''s a lot of barriers or handlers to really onboard more users into BNB chain ecosystem or into WebStory spaces. For example, if you are a retailer, you need to have BNB tokens in your wallet to be the gas fee when you want to transfer your assets to your friends or to interact with any kind of devs on BNB chains. For example, if you are really doing farming or doing trading on different protocols, even on different chains, there is different protocols or a website you need to go through. For example, you need to use bridge. You need to use many protocols and taxes on different platforms and different blockchains. So we think there''s a lot of things we can do in terms of these user barriers to really onboard them seamlessly. So one thing we have started last year is to giving a gas-less solution to our user by integrating with the top CEX, with the top bullets, and any kind of DeFi or even payment gateways. So we introduced a solution called MegaFuel, developed by NodeRail and sponsored by BNB chain foundation. And we integrated it with wallets, for example, like Ocas wallet, Binance website wallet, Trust wallet, Bigger wallet, those top ones that you can think of. And also most of the top liquidity sectors also integrated with this solution. So if you have USDT, USDC, or FDUSD on BMC on the wallet or on the SEC I just mentioned, you can simply withdraw or transfer your stable coins to the others without having the BME tokens in your wallets. And also we are working with some of the really interesting protocols to enable users to donate money through Twitter or even in the future through Instagram or other kinds of social medias. And we also saw that some community members or builders and even VCs that they are utilizing this unique features to donate money to PhDs, to researchers, to help them and to incentivize them and even to teach them how to use wallet. Some of them even the first time they try Trust wallet and they don''t need to buy any BNB tokens in their wallet to transfer a stable coin. They think, oh, this is really, you know, excited. They can''t imagine that will happen. So that''s a way how we educate the people they have never tried blockchain, they have never tried wallet before. This initiative we''ll keep doing this year and we will plan to enable megafield to support any kind of assets. Not just stablecoin, but also all coins, whatever the coin you have on the BNB chain, you can consider to get it supported on megafield and you can sponsor the gas for the users on your own. So that''s the thing that we have done, starting from last year, which is quite important. And we wanted to promote this stablecoin transfer and payment initiative on top of BNB chain. Besides that, we''re also working really, really hard to protect our users and to give our users more user-friendly trading experiences. That''s why we enabled MEV protection services by working with a lot of validators, wallets, and DeFi protocol. So right now, if you are using trust wallets or any other top-weighted to do the trade, any kind of that, for example, on PankerSwap, you can use the MEV protection solutions directly or other default solutions on BNB chains, which will protect your transactions. And we are keep optimizing the solutions together with our validators and our wallet solution providers. And even recently, we have put out a public voting through Snapshot to asking the comments and opinions from the users and the communities. And I think a majority of them agree that if there is any bad thing that has been done in terms of MEV by the validators or even the key players in the BNB chain ecosystem, we''re going to punish them. So that''s another thing we are trying very hard to make the trading experiences on BNB chain more friendly to end builders and to protect our users'' assets. We keep doing these things together with our builders this year. Actually, we''re also planning to onboard a smart wallet solution together with our wallet providers, which means once there''s a smart wallet solution, users even don''t really need to understand private key, public keys, how to manage your private keys, how to remember those data. You don''t need to understand that. You will have a really, really simple way just ask how you do traders, how you log into your Google account by using the smart wallet solutions on BNB chain. That is also one of the very, very important tech features that we are planning to do this year. So by having all those different initiatives or technical features to be ready here, our goal is to support our, you know, you know, tenant developers and entrepreneurs to really provide the solutions that is workable and usable for end user. Whatever it is, just a trader, a meme coin fence, or it is a real retailer user that is using this double coin to transfer over different countries and regions. So we wanted to build this together with all our ecosystem builders. But besides that, right, we have some focus this year. One important focus I wanted to highlight is AI related solutions. We all know that AI is a really important technology that''s going to increase productivity in the futures. And blockchain is the way that we really changing how people interact with each other, how we monetize each other, and how the system can incentivize the contributors in the future. So that''s two really, really unique and interesting technologies in the future. And we do think there''s a unique combination between each other. For example, right now, the AI technology has been controlled by the top AI companies. And your data, and in the future, maybe your own AI girlfriend or AI boyfriend will be controlled by those big companies. But you don''t want it to happen, right? So we really need to have blockchain technologies to really governance AI technology development in the future. And there''s a lot of other things we can think of. For example, the people is talking about AI agent recently. Why AI agents should combine with blockchain technologies? Because if you think AI agent can be a digital person in the future, and everybody can have different digital persons by your own, and you can tailor-made it. And how AI agent person can really help you in your daily life. There is a really important function you should have, which is really interacting with your assets. And they can use smart contract to monetize the programmability of smart contract to manage your assets, or to do their daily job per your own request. So that''s why digital assets and AI agent combined can have a really magical power to really enable a smart economy in the future. So imagine you have assets on the blockchain. Maybe it''s USDT, it''s Cybercoin, or it''s ULB and Cybercoin. And then you want to invest in different kinds of assets. It can be a stock. It can be a digital gold. It can be a design for a close. You want to sponsor some like PHE, et cetera, things. How you can do it right now? You can only do it in different bank system and different centralized finance platforms. But in the future, by having AI agent plus those digital assets on the chain, you can do it in one single way. Just by just interacting with this AI agent that is dedicated to do investment solutions for you. So just by having one AI agent, you can invest in different types of assets. And even you can have different types of DeFi logo by building on top of it. That''s just one single case. In the future, you can also do a lot of things by utilizing AI agent plus digital assets in your daily life. That will be really exciting for every people. And that will really improve the efficiency of the whole society. So that''s why we''re pushing very hard to be the AI first chain this year for BNB chains. So here is an AI landscape that we prepared. There''s already over 16 AI related projects building on top of BNB chains. This is just a start. There''s going to be a lot more AI projects that''s going to launch on BNB chain mainnet. Those projects can be AI plus data labeling projects, can be AI agent projects. It also can be AI tech info related. Like they are building an AI infrastructure that can easily onboard different developers to build any kind of AI projects on top of BNB chain and tokenize it. And interact with DeFi protocols on BNB chains. And also a lot of other, for example, decentralized computing and AI governance, etc. So we talk to a lot of like really talented AI developers in this space every day. And we are really excited about what they''re going to build in their futures by combining these two technologies together. And to support them, as I mentioned, we have BNB screen Greenfield here as a really important layer. So if you are doing AI data labeling projects, you can easily store your data onto BNB Greenfield. This year we''ve gone on to add privacy protection functions onto Greenfield as well. So you don''t need to worry about your data''s privacy if you really store that data on the decentralized storage in the futures. And also if you are just doing the AI agent, you want to have agent memory functions for your products. Then you can also store the agent related data, metadata onto Greenfield to enable the memory functions there. So Greenfield will be a really important layer here to make us to be the layers or to the infra that is dedicated for AI dApps compared with all other. layer one or layer two protocols. So they don''t have that functions there. And also we are building a lot of interesting AI agent solutions or tools. For example, AI blockchain plugins by aggregating different AI blockchain solutions into AI developer tools. For example, a lot of people launching the AI assets on chain and then we integrate with those launchpad or Dexas that rally. So if you are building the AI products on their platform, then there''s going to be a plug-in solutions which can easily get your assets to be launched on BNB chain or traded on BNB chains. And also we work in a more comprehensive multi-agent infrastructures which will enable different agents in a BNB chain ecosystem can communicate and even work with each other. So we work in a lot of different ways to do different types of data. So we work in a lot of different types of data, which means you have one agent to do one task A, you have agent to do task B, and then you can combine those together to finalize, to really realize a really complicated task or request for your users or for your customers. And also we are trying to work with the top AI companies to more incentivize some independent AI developers to open source their AI solutions or whatever code they have on GitHub to benefit the future AI developers together with us. So that''s the goal and that''s what we have to do in our BNB chain ecosystem. And as I mentioned, by having the one BNB concept, we are a layer that is offering the cheap gas fee, high throughput, and comprehensive technology solutions, and a lot of like AI related tools that is ready for any types of assets or AI products to building on top of. And recently we are talking with some of the really, really interesting researchers in the universities in terms of some really advanced AI research. So in the future, we will support more AI research related protocols under these science sectors. We may help them to fund more money through blockchain or through crypto industries and to support them to do more advanced research in AI aspect. So, and also we know the developers is one of the most important communities or most important type of person we need to target. That is the person that is really using our technologies and expanding it to the end users. So we wanted to really build a layer that is very friendly for different types of developers. At the beginning, I have mentioned we are EVM compatible layers, which means if you are a solid-t contract, smart contract coder, it will be easy for you to write any kind of contract, smart contract on BNB chains. But besides that, we are developing a lot of like streamlined SDKs and APIs to enable the more easier way to develop there. And also we are working with different infra builders, including AI, including data platforms, including validators, any kind of like developer tools like Acme, and the Fiat on-or-ramp solution providers, and a lot like DeFi infras like Dexas, Landings. All of them are really open to support different types of like developers. And we have a kickstart program that is combining all those relevant services provider like auditing, security auditing, data provider, etc. And getting them to have a discounted service that is offered dedicated to BNB chain ecosystem builders, or even giving them some free credit to our developers. So if you are building there, at least the infra is quite ready, and even you are getting a really cheap, you know, services there offered by our partners. And also we are building an open source development framework. As I mentioned, right, especially for AI, we are trying to incentivize those top AI developers to open source their code, and to contribute their code to the whole ecosystem, and build more advanced AI solutions on top of our BNB chain ecosystem. And also BNB chain is doing an AI code copilator, which is, as I mentioned, kind of like aggregators for different types of the AI solutions or tools building there that''s going to be used for any type of AI related builders. So, but besides the tool that we have developed there that is ready for use for our developers, there is also a lot of incentive and programs that we have done and we will keep going doing in the coming years. Those incentives can be divided into two parts. One is money related, another one is other type of support. I think everybody will care about what is the monetization solution or support or incentive you have, you know, the BNB chain ecosystem. So I will spend a bit more time on this part. So actually we have different type of incentive, money incentivized approaches to support our developers. One is Hackersong. Actually, this week we just started the AI Hackersong together with some other AI project that''s the sponsor for the Hackersong. So every year we will have like two, three to four online Hackersongs and a few offline Hackersong. This year at April, we will have another Hackersong maybe in Hong Kong as well. So we encourage any types of builders to attend our Hackersong. And the winner of our Hackersong may be able to directly connect you to the NBB incubation program that we have together with Easy Labs. Or they can just attend our BIA event, which is incubation alliance together with those top VCs. So Hackersong is a way that we find and we support our builders. And there''s already some really interesting project that''s been running out of the Hackersong before us. So this year, as I mentioned, AI Hackersong just started right now. So you can feel free to apply our Hackersong online and submit your code. And maybe we can see each other in the future during the Hackersong demo days. But besides that, as I mentioned, there''s another two really important initiatives. One is BIA. What is BIA? It is a BNB chain incubation alliance that we do together with top VCs, as I mentioned, including Easy Labs, Dragonfly, Pantera, Spartan, Forestide Winchairs, etc. So this year, BIA is going to be bigger than last year. Last year, we had six rounds of BIA in different events. And finally, there is a large project has been selected through BIA and they''re already being accepted into MVB programs with Easy Labs. And some of them even being invested by Easy Lab in the end. I won''t say the name because they didn''t disclose it yet, but that''s a way how we support projects. But this year, we''re going to make BIA even bigger by partnering with a lot other ventures, especially some ventures that have committed some amountings for the top winners for BIA events. For example, East Denver next week, we''re going to have 10 projects doing pitching there. And we already got commitment from at least three ventures, I mean three outside ventures, except Easy Lab to funding the top winners or to directly accept them to their incubation programs. So BIA is a really important approach that we''re using to support and monetizing our developers. This year at April in Hong Kong, we will also do another round of BIA. So if you have a project or you are a VC, you want to collaborate with us on BIA event, feel free to reach out to me or Walter who is sitting there. And then we can talk about more on how we can work together on BIA this year, which is going to be very interesting. And also, MVB program, just as I mentioned, right, that''s a very, very long-term program that we had with Easy Lab before. And using that program, we have already invested a lot, really interesting projects, and get them building on top of BNCHNs. So MVB session 9 has just ended like three weeks ago. Right now we are doing the review into the, you know, hundreds and thousands of applications. And every round we will select around 10 to 15 projects to be admitted to MVB program. And finally, there''s going to be few projects selected to be invested by Easy Labs based on their on-chain metrics of BNB chain or other things like mind share of the project and the product features. So I think a lot of people wanted to know what is the criteria for your MVB programs when you''re selecting different project or developer to support. Actually, it''s a comprehensive consideration. It depends on what product you are building, what is the unique feature you are having by utilizing blockchain technologies. What is your target users? What is the team background? And how you''re going to make it to go to market? And most importantly is what is the biggest potential contribution you''re going to have on BNB chain in terms of their product features, in terms of the out-chain metrics like TVO, like DAU, like trading volume, etc. things. So if you wanted to apply MVB next round, which may happen like three months ago, then you need to really consider this metrics when you''re preparing your product or your presentations. That is about MVB. But besides that, we also have a lot of incentive programs. If you are a meme trader, you may know this week we just announced a 4.4 million incentive programs for meme coins. So if you are a top meme coins on BNB chains that''s been traded there in terms of the market cap, in terms of the holders of the meme coins, and also maybe the trading volume, etc. And then you will get direct LP support from us. So we will use half of the money to buy your token and half of money as BNB and add it as LP directly into your assets on Pancake. That can be something really interesting. And we already thought that there''s a lot of assets issuer that is launching their token on BNB chain and get their communities or users to trade on BNB chains. That''s one thing we are doing right now. And there''s going to be another really interesting thing we will start soon, which is AI agent asset trading competitions. We''re working together with data platforms. So right now on BNB chain, there is at least five different AI launch pads that''s majorly running on top of BNB chains. So if you want it to be a tailor-made AI agents on BNB chain and launch the assets on BNB chain, you can do it right now because you can attend the AI agent assets trading competitions there. And the winner can also get some monetization incentivized from the program. And we are working with those top AI agent platforms as well. So maybe they will also give in some incentivize for the builder that is really using their AI infra to build different type of AI agents on BNB chains. And also we have builder grant program that is dedicated for especially infra builders or tool builders, like data platforms or developer tools. So if you are really building some unique developer tool that can solve our issues right now, reach out to me. We can talk about your ideas. And our builder grant review process will take around like one to two months to finally get an answer to you whether your grant proposal being accepted or not. Last year we have doing grant support for a lot of projects or infra that is building on top of OPBNB. And we have released a grant wish list on our GitHub. So you can reach, you can check the wish list on the GitHub to see what direction we are really pushing hard ways. And we are really waiting to using builder grants to support ways. And also we have DAU incentive program, TVO incentive program, a lot of others. And we will tailor make some really interesting program this year as well according to users'' request. So let us know what you want, what kind of support you are expecting from BNB chain foundation. We can think of it. We can talk. We can even tailor make it for use. That is about monetization incentive that we have in hand that is supporting projects. But besides that, the general support we have is also important. For example, marketing support, technology support, and community support. What''s interesting is we''re even helping some of our projects to connect with the top KOL in our BNB chain ecosystem. So some projects, they just start from zero. They don''t know where they can find the KOL that they can support their product functions on BNB chain. And what we do is we connect them and they can talk with each other what they wanted to do each other. And if there''s any deal that they can reach with each other. So if you don''t have KOLs, maybe even you are just Web 2 before. You don''t know people working in this space. We are the bridges here for you to connect with them. We even connect you with centralized exchange, with wallet solution providers, with a lot of VCs or big KOLs in this space. Only if you are building something really contributing to our ecosystem and really, really interesting for users and for other developers. So besides that, I think everybody, some of you guys already follow BNB chain traders. So there is a huge amount of followers of our social media. So any kind of marketing support will also be a big beneficiary to our developers and to our ecosystem builders. So once you are a project that''s launching on Main8 and we have done a tech DD, we will be happy to support you with general marketing support. Like for example, retweet your official launch on BNB chain, AMM, online, online events, different type of marketing programs, whatever it is. So there''s different things we can do in terms of promotions. So we are always very open and friendly to our projects and to our developers and users. We''ll just be there and we want to reach out to you if you have any interesting idea. And we even wanted to combine or connecting you with other builders in our ecosystem and to encourage you guys to discuss with each other and find some really new ideas or programs or dApps. So that is how we incentivize and how we support BNB chain ecosystem. This year, we are focusing on how to onboard more AI developers on BNB chains. But besides that, we are also pushing hard on stablecoin, as I mentioned, and also RWA and designs. So if you are doing any type of project, especially regarding AI, RWA, stablecoin, designs, reach out to us. We wanted to talk to you. For sure, if you are just a meme coin, traders or even launchers, you are a liquidity provider, can also reach out to us, talk to us. We are happy to talk about your special culture and your communities and how to build that community together with BNB chain ecosystem. So here are the contact ways how you can get connected with us.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('protocol_village__solana', 'Protocol Village_ Solana', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hi, my name is Amelia Daly and I am a public servant of the Solana Foundation and I have the distinct pleasure of doing two things for you today in the next six-ish minutes. First, I will tell you the latest and greatest, what''s going on with Solana and more importantly, introduce you to some founders that are building some incredible businesses on Solana. So let''s get into it. It''s particularly pertinent that we''re sitting here in Hong Kong today because Solana is global. 40% of users, 50% of developers from the last hackathon and 70% of liquidity originates here in Asia. If we think about a global economy, one of the best ways to visualize that on chain is through stable coins. The state of stable coins is growing at an incredible rate and you can see that Solana now is responsible for 45% of volume. Now, let''s break down volume a little bit because this is one of these types of metrics that can be interpreted in a number of different ways in this industry. Traditionally, it''s been TVL. Now, one of the things that I''d like to reframe, especially from the network''s perspective, is a parked asset as measured by total value locked, actually that meaningful for the underlying platform, which is responsible for powering the assets across the world. In fact, reframing to look at velocity as the most important measure for stable coins, stable coin health as a representation of the frequency in which that asset is being used, touched, and then therefore a representation of adoption is far more important. I''m going to continue to emphasize the way in which we see things as a network or a platform that may be different than how others frame these same metrics. And that''s because Solana is infrastructure. It is the financial layer that these businesses that I will be talking through and introducing to you later need to be built upon. And Solana needs to be the best place for, one, founders, two, applications, and three, tokens. And one of the things that''s important to do at the network level is to continue to innovate that as demand goes up, as you can see through transactions, the cost of doing business goes down. So that''s the fees. We''ve talked about the stable coin market. We''ve talked about some of the infrastructure requirements for doing business. Let''s look at how the applications have fared on Solana over the last three quarters. One important way of measuring application health is, of course, actually through their own GDP or real economic value. Applications on Solana have generated over $800 million in revenue over the last three quarters. This is essential. Businesses need revenue. But it''s not just on-chain businesses that have been crypto-native that are building on Solana. We''re seeing fintech build on-chain solutions as well. Earlier in 2024, PayPal launched their stable coin on Solana called PYUSD. Visa is now settling in USDC on Solana. And one of the things that I''d like to drill down upon with Visa in particular is actually looking at an analysis that they ran. Now, across a number of different chains, they observed something kind of unique that, again, goes back to that velocity metric that I was describing earlier. And what you can see across this chart is that disproportionately, Solana is sending a high number of small value transactions. The majority of transactions are under $100 US. And so then when we think about this from the infrastructure layer, the platform in which these businesses need to choose to be applied, what''s required? Well, they''re kind of a pragmatic set of North Star metrics that the platform needs to be held to. It must be fast. It must be cheap. And it must be final. And there is an infinite amount of work that needs to be done to continue to make improvements across all three of these categories. And that''s really what the foundation thinks and focuses on. Now, you''ll probably want to hear from someone besides me about how that''s going. And the real test of how effective that is is actually talking to the founders who are in the trenches building. So let''s talk a little bit about who you''ll hear from. We have a diverse set of speakers here that represent a number of different topics in the space. You''ll hear about hardware and deepen from Kudis and Jumbo. You''ll hear about composability and scalability from Sonic, Solaire, and Zeus. And you''ll hear about PayFi, or as I like to call it, magic internet money from Huma. So rather than have me tell you about these things, I will pass it off to the first speaker who will show you how Solana is helping to power their business. Dirk Hwang- All right, all right. Hi, everybody here. My name is Dirk. I''m the CMO and co-founder of Kudis. So if you are wandering in this place and you see somebody wearing a ring, chances are it might not be the aura ring, or it might not be their engagement ring. It might be the Kudis ring. So we are the leading crypto consumer wearable built on Solana. So let''s give a little bit of background of what we do. We founded the company back in 2023. We''re lucky to be one of the hackathon winning project in the deep end space back in the Renaissance hackathon last year. Dirk Hwang- All right, so we''re here. The Kudis offers a different type of product, but in a nutshell, it consists of the Kudis ring, the Kudis super app, the Kudis data platform, and the Kudis token. So what we are doing here is that we are trying to challenge the current exploitative data model from the Web2 giants. We''re giving users full control of their health data while enabling secure data trading. So we''ve had, in just a little bit more than half a year, we''ve had more than 4 million in revenue. We''ve sold over 15,000 rings globally. We''ve also accrued more than 100,000 app users across 103 countries. But we aim bigger. We aim to connect the next 100 million devices. We aim to tap into the billion-dollar wellness app market. We aim to serve not only the global crypto users, but also the global smart wearable users. So this is what we have built in just a little bit more than half a year. So from scratch, we built a Kudis app. The app allows you to track your sports mode, your mental wellness. We''ve also launched something which makes sports, a healthy lifestyle, interesting for people, and that is called a social challenge. We''ve had metabolism optimization. We also built an AI coach. within our app that is providing customized service and customized advice to our users. We''ve implemented a point-based reward system, and more importantly, we have actually built the health data ownership within the app. And all of these are at zero cost because we don''t like subscription model, and that''s why we decided to waive it. And here are some of the stats from the last four months. We were able to actually integrate more than 70 plus wireless apps and hardwares. We''ve tracked more than 8 million heart rates. We''ve had more than 1 million sleep hour track, more than 2 billion steps, and more than 200,000 workout sessions. And more importantly, we have built strong partnership with not only industry giants, but also mainstream partners in the name of WorldCoin, ECLA, VitaDow, Bonk, Magic Eden, et cetera. But again, Qtis is more than just a smart ring or a wellness device. Qtis empowers users to own their wellness data through a secure and user-centric ecosystem. And we know that people don''t like their data to be tracked by large companies, let alone the companies profiting from their data. And that is why we are here to make a change. So with our Qtis super app and wellness data asset marketplace, we were actually able to take the data from the users, let them integrate their data, help the users securely store their data anonymously, and transform it into digital asset on-chain. And then throughout our Qtis wellness data marketplace, we were able to, again, privately, securely share this data with our partners, which will give extra incentives to our users. So this is how the Qtis ecosystem works in a nutshell. We allow users to connect their wearable device, connect their wellness tracking apps to our app, and then we allow them to sync up their data. And through a proprietary data processing layer with validators, we''re actually helping the users to store the data, we''re able to help them label their data, and we were able to clear the data, which we prepare it, ready for the Qtis data marketplace. And these data are actually very important to a lot of the industry partners. For example, we are currently powering up all the AI model, AI wellness model training, as well as design studies. We are providing insights into medical industries. We''re providing personal insights to the insurance companies or corporates, and we''re providing more values to the wellness industry in general. So once again, at Qtis, we''re tapping into the $6.3 trillion digital health market, and none of these can actually happen without the use of blockchain or Solana. So that''s why we''re grateful to be here. And just want to sum it up using one of our favorite lines. Your health is your wealth. So if you have not heard about Qtis, now it''s time to learn more about it and join us. Thank you. Hello, hello. Good afternoon, everyone. My name is Jason. I''m from Solair. Today I''m going to share a little bit more about our plans after the token gets traded because right now it''s traded across different venues. And hopefully, one of the takeaways is that you know that the members of the project are still working very hard to deliver on the max milestone, which I think is very exciting. So a little bit more about me. I''m Jason. I lead the technology team at Solair. Before this, I co-founded MPC Vault, which is a multi-chain custody solution for businesses which are now transacting about a billion dollars every week on chain, servicing a variety of folks. So I''m mostly in cryptography and also a little bit of GPU training, especially the scheduling part of it from which I have sourced immense inspiration for what''s next to come at Solair. Other team members include folks from Sushi, Amazon Web Services and Microsoft. Also just want to announce that we''ve recently acquired a team called FastLand. They''re really talented folks. So they did a lot of security research, MEV, and also EVM semantics. EVM research. They have stopped and of course returned almost $50 million just in the past year for EVM hacks across different chains, DMV, Arbitrum, and Ethereum included. You might know one of my colleagues who got really famous recently because of the Libra scam. He''s the person, you know, the first person leading the investigation on chain to uncover all the intricate relationships between all the different addresses that are linked to the Libra scam and he''s very outspoken about, you know, actually doing something to this space. So kudos to him. Just want to mention it. If you check Twitter, he will show up. Now, disclaimer, nothing I''m saying here is investment advice or financial guidance. So don''t take any financial actions because of what I said. I''m just here sharing technical stuff. So where Solier started was restaking. And restaking is something very interesting, but we decided to approach it with a very organic yield form as opposed to copying whatever eigenlayer has done. So we did a lot of validator optimization. And on Solana, there''s also a thing called stake-weighted quality of service, which means that your transaction can get through faster if you send it from a validator with stake. So we''ll have an endpoint called acceleration.solaire, acc.solaire.org, that has a main transaction landing latency of two slots, and that''s about 0.8 seconds because we have a huge amount of stake. And on the other end, we also have a very interesting solution for liquid staking on Solana, and you can transform the tokens into different formats. For example, like Sonic, our great partner who''s going to present next, is using one of our solutions. And SonicSole, BGSole, SO, they''re all liquid staking solutions on Solana. They have the highest yield right now. And you also, they share the same liquidity pool. So if you''re trading SonicSole for USDC, you''ll be able to leverage the same liquidity pool for BGSO, which is BigGat, so a cryptocurrency exchange, or SO, Solare, so we''re just showing the same liquidity. So that''s her restaking solution on Solana. It''s very different, but also happy to say that it has the highest yield. During the Trump trade, the yield reached about 19.8%, and this is a native API. So right now, it''s about 11% as of today, if you just go to the website, but this is what we''re doing, and it''s organic yield as opposed to points farming or things like that. So that''s our approach. Now, the next chapter of Solare is really focused on a Solana acceleration solution. We got inspiration from our validator optimization experiences. We know that if we remove some of the protocol limits and restructure things a little bit, we''re able to achieve much higher TPS. And we''re looking at a million TPS, not just a little bit better. We''re looking at 100x of Monat. I mean, I''m not saying anything bad about them, just that this technology allows us to do that. So we''re super excited to present exactly how that''s going to be achieved. So I''m going to skip a couple of things here. So the first thing you have to resolve is actually the network bottleneck, right? Let''s just put things into perspective. What does a million TPS even mean, right? It means that it''s one million multiplied by one kilobyte per transaction or looking at 10 gigabits per second. And in a peer-to-peer relationship, you have to peer with other machines, meaning that you have to send the same amount of data to other people. And if you were to propagate like that, 10 multiplied by 10 is 100 gigabits. And that''s like a massive number for even data center switches to handle, right? So what that means is that you have to restructure the network topology so Solier-Infini SVM''s topology is a mega leader with a decentralized network of verifiers. And there''s a particular way that we structure the streaming and the broadcast of transactions that make this happen. And the second result is that you have to use data center grade equipment in order to accelerate your chain to this speed. So this is a totally new paradigm that we''re taking for building the network. And another thing is that the reason why we''re able to accelerate so much is that what if you pre-execute a transaction and you just apply the state as opposed to processing the transaction on the go, right? You save a lot of time if by the time that the process of the transaction reaches the execution pipeline, if everything is still fresh, it''s not stale, as per technical term, you can just apply the change of state. And by doing this, we actually increased our throughput by I think a factor of two or three from our research results just by doing pre-execution. But again, on the left-hand side, you''ll see that the chain architecture has become a mega leader with a decentralized group of verifiers. So that''s the chain structure. So I talked about the execution, how we''re saving time on the execution side of things. Let''s go to the first, you know, ingress of this. So you first do, when transaction comes in, you first need to do seek verify, deduplication, and scheduling. And there are things to do over there. So we''ve come up with a thing called pre-execution. I talked about execution being, you know, pre-execution being able to accelerate, you know, the sort of the execution stage of it. There''s also another task that a pre-execution cluster is doing, which is parallelizing sig verify. So what sig verify does is that it''s looking at your transaction and then check if the user or whoever the signer have to be have actually signed a transaction. And that''s a very cryptographically and CPU-intensive calculation. So we''re just offloading it to a cluster that does so and therefore saving time when it''s coming to the latency-sensitive stage. Another thing is that in order to scale blockchain, you have to make sure that your blockchain state runs on, you know, a distributed cluster as opposed to on a single machine. Up to this state, every single blockchain is one single binary. It''s like one single program. Running on one single machine. But for Solaire''s Infini SVM, it''s designed to run different components on a cluster of machines and therefore achieving this higher TPS but true scalability. And we''re making use of a bit of, you know, AI technology here. It''s called InfiniBand. It''s, if you''re ever in AI training, you''ll know InfiniBand because the data from, if you do model pipelining or data pipelining, the data is passed from one machine to another, you know, GPU one to another via InfiniBand. It''s a very super low latency and high throughput connection protocol, peer-to-peer connection protocol. So that''s something that we''re using within our own cluster. Therefore, we call it hardware accelerated cluster. Now, last but not least, the code star problem for any chain, right? And I''ll just say this. The reason why we''re building this is because during the Trump trade, during the, you know, the meme cycle, we''ve noticed a lot of problems with scalabilities on Solana. It''s fast. Don''t get me wrong. It''s super fast, but it''s not fast enough. Meme trade are able to congest Solana already. And then the congestion symptom is in the form of transaction not getting confirmed. It''s not in the form of high fees, but rather your transactions like keep pending and just doesn''t go through. And so we think there''s a lot of organic demand if more people are going to join Solana, more people are going to move things onto Solana and SBM in general. So our job is to make it as transparent the adoption as we possibly can. And you might be familiar with EVM L2s. So just a few comparisons to show what the differences are. First is that for EVM L2s, users have to go through a breach site. You know, you go somewhere else to do that before you come back to the DApp. For Solana or Infinix VM, you don''t have to do that. As long as the DApp decentralized application itself uses an SDK, that''s all it takes, right? Like import the SDK and we take care of everything else. Wallet support, to your surprise, this might be. We don''t require wallet support. And this is because SVM transaction does not hash the chain ID as part of the signature scheme. So there''s a very clever way of handling it. So because of time constraints, I shall not walk through some of the semantics of how we''re doing it. But feel free to check out solare.org. There''s a white paper on there that details some of the technical architecture of why, you know, things can be made invisible to the user. At the end of the day, users don''t really care about which chain you''re on. You care about the app. Right? You care about the application you''re using. And the applications care about the end user latency that the chain is capable of delivering. And by having this architecture, I think the entire user experience and the calling, you know, the programmatic call can be very much similar to just HTTP rest, like a web to each programming style, as opposed to very much async because I can give you the response in real time because it''s low latency and high throughput. So that will conclude my presentation. And feel free to check out, send me an email, follow me on Twitter, or just go to the website and check out more stuff. I''ll be around. I''m happy to talk to anyone. Thank you very much. All right. Hi, everyone. My name is Chris Zhu. I''m one of the co-founders and the CEO of Sonic SVM. We recently just went live, so I''m actually very, very excited to be here for the first time since our January launch. You guys might have seen us trading on different venues in Korea, in Japan, across Asia, in the U.S., and we''re live on Kraken there as well. So very excited to share and get this opportunity from the Solana Foundation to be here talking about one major new topic that we at Sonic SVM have been very, very excited about. So last couple of weeks, you might have seen Solana kind of advertising a new concept called the Internet''s capital market, and we think the chain itself has actually captured that very well from the early on-chain NASDAQ to the recent ecosystem boom, whether it be tokenizing RWAs or meme coins or entertainment products and NFTs, right? But at the center of that, it''s really about how we were able to productize and tokenize attention on Solana. So Sonic SVM proposed this new concept called attention capital markets, and I am here to share a little bit about that with you guys. So I''m going to take a different approach to what Jason just did on the Solana SVM, and he did a wonderful job prefacing the background and the technical differences between SVMs, but now we''re going to focus on attention, and that is the key word for what consensus is about, for where liquidity is coming from, where volume is coming from. But before that, let''s just go through a quick recap on what is Sonic, right? Who are we and why are we here talking to you about SVM and where we got the idea to build this? So Sonic was actually the first SVM to launch on Solana, but really it was made for applications and games. So that''s our bread and butter. I came from a background of ByteDance, so TikToks, and our team, Electronic Arts, Tencent, such and so forth. So we were all really focused on one notion, which was how do we digitize gaming assets, entertainment assets, and send that out to the entire world? So three years ago when we started building on Solana, way back when, there was very limited applications for entertainment and for games, and there''s less asset for them as well. If you look at 2018, 2019, you had DeFi plus games, and then you had NFT plus games like the Step-Ins, the Genopets of the world, and fast forward, you have Meme Coins plus games. So games are amazing hosts of every single asset category that is at the forefront of everything. But at the center of it, why games actually attract liquidity and volume is because they capture the user''s attentions and bring additional users into the ecosystem so that we''re not just stuck here with an existing liquidity pool. So now we have three keywords here, right? You guys are familiar with Pump.fun, AI agents, and TikTok. What is the commonality between all of this? And we would argue is they capture attention at a very, very large scale. Albeit at each single one of these products, even Kaito recently, you''re tokenizing attention at a different time scale, right? So for Pump, for example, users'' attentions are on a daily basis. And if you don''t capture that within the next day, you lose all of that liquidity. AI agents, on the other hand, is sitting on Twitter or on a LOM-based platform, but sitting in a traffic pool. So whether it be AIXVT or a virtual platform like Luna, they''re actually capturing attention through the functionality of the AI agents. And what we did was we built a product on top of TikTok called SonicX. And that product is a connector for legacy social media, and half a million users were able to claim our airdrops on top of TikTok. So we think that attention is where money flows, right? Crypto projects are financialized network-based products and services, and the value of network increases as more people start to use it. This is pretty common sense, but if you think about it, the more liquidity, the more decentralization more utility and social engagement comes from your product. And how do projects create them? And we think it''s maximizing trust, create amplification channels, and really providing individual stake incentives for these products. And we did that through Sonic SVM, through each one of these methods, where the TikTok mini-app created amplification channels. The entire transactional log of your interaction or tokenization on top of TikTok is transparent on top of Sonic SVM. And we were able to drop over half a million users to Solana SVL tokens. So now, when it comes to how we''re thinking about productization of attention on Solana, we proposed three additional kind of assets, asset standards. The first one is what we call Sonic Attention Index. Sonic Attention Index tracks three major metrics. The first one is volume. The second is liquidity. And the third is all types of social metric data and social media metric data. And we combine that into SAI. It reflects the attention and liquidity across the entire Sonic SVM ecosystem. The second is the TikTok mini-app that we just talked about. So we dropped hash key tokens. We dropped Sonic tokens. And we dropped them to over 2 million total users across the board. The third is what we propose as the newest asset standard on top of the chain called Sonic Attention Tokens. So by combining the entire transparent data, tracking volume, liquidity, and attention metrics, we are able to incentivize projects on top of Sonic with all levels of incentivizations. So at the center of that, our focus has always been on distribution. Testnet user numbers exceed 2.7 million. We were able to reach a peak at FDB and really generate transactions that are on billions of scale in the last six months or so. But the next stage after pre-mainnet where we did 10 iterations and upgrades, recorded 3 billion transactions, we accumulated millions of users. What is the next stage? And I am here to announce we are going to release mainnet on February 27th. And with that, we also introduced the first application-focused hackathon Sonic is bringing to the rest of the world, tracking liquidity volume and allowing Solana builders to amplify all of their applications through our TikTok mini-app and through our attention index so that they get the maximum exposure. So come build with us and come build on Solana. That concludes my presentation today and thank you so much. Hello, hello, hello. Mic check? All right, awesome. Hi, everyone. I''m James, the co-founder and CEO of Jumbo, the largest mobile on-chain network starting with the Jumbo phone. Now, hold on. First of all, I know it''s 4 p.m. right now. Everyone''s Tired. This is the fourth presentation. They said I got eight minutes. I only need six. Just bear with me. I''ll explain to you how to onboard the next billion users in crypto. So, first of all, before we begin, can I get a raise of hands? How many people here grew up in Latin America, Africa, or Southeast Asia, like an emerging market? Raise of hands. All right, all right. So five people will understand when I say I''m ethnically Chinese, but I grew up in a country called Congo in Central Africa. My family''s three generations there. And when you grow up in an emerging market, like I just listed, you run into problems like cross-border payments, remittances, bank-in-the-em-banked, where literally 40% of the population banked. And reasons like this is due to high transaction costs, hyperinflation, and a lack of banking infrastructure. You might only get access to some neobanks. But when you put all these issues together in emerging markets, you look at Venezuela, you look at Congo, Turkey, you realize everything begins and ends with one thing, mobile infrastructure, because these areas have completely skipped the PC stage. So at Jumbo, what we are doing today is essentially we created a $99 US smartphone pre-installed with Web3 applications that solves the chokehold of crypto, of accessibility, and onboarding, where users can come in, spend their time, and we call it the phone that pays you, because honestly, you can earn tokens, and we provide you with on-ramp and off-ramps in over 100 countries in the world today. So, Jumbo started 2021. The first two years, I''m not gonna lie, one of the hardest things you look at any deep-in sector project that deals with manufacturing, and if you''re hardware, is supply chain and manufacturing. You look at any project out there today that has any hardware devices, it is very difficult to lower your cost of your product so that users can actually, in a cost-effective unit basis, use your products and provide that compute power and nodes into an ecosystem that makes sense. So, honestly, I''m very proud to announce today, sitting up, standing up here, we''ve sold, since 2024, exactly one year ago, about 850,000 phones to over 120 countries, which is very important, the markets that we''re distributing to, over a million Jumbo app downloads on the Google Play Store. So, if you''re Android, please check it out. It''s your multi-chain wallet that supports 13 chains and your Questing platform, and we''ve created over 10 million wallets. Now, the Jumbo Phone 2, we announced at Solana Breakpoint in September, 12 gigabytes of RAM, 6.75-inch display, 128 gigs of storage. It''s essentially the most powerful $99 US dollar smartphone you can find in the world today. A lot of people, you might be standing here and asking me right now, James, what does a Web3 smartphone even mean? At the basis, it''s Android-based. It comes with full Android capabilities, iPhone 11 storage, and RAM, but at the end of the day, users in these emerging markets, right now, the largest markets, say, Brazil, Latin America, users can now come in, spend time, and be accessed to the open financial ecosystem. I''ll put it this way. I grew up in Africa, right? Africa''s 54 countries, 1.4 billion people. 40% of the continent is unbanked. So literally, you might say, okay, I''m gonna airdrop a non-custodial digital wallet to the entire continent. Congrats, you just banked the entire continent. The issue is, people still have no access to the global financial ecosystem because they don''t have credit. Literally, your phone number in Africa is your ENS domain. It is how you get access to your profile. There is no WeChat, there''s no Tencent, there''s no Alibaba, there''s no Venmo. You''re not gonna pay your supplier manufacturing in a different country. You''re not gonna send your friend money in different rails. It is very difficult, and all of this is due to the inherent issues of hyperinflation, low banking costs, and high transaction fees. So with Jumbo, today, you are essentially able to access and bridge through all of these legacy ecosystem and bookkeepers through Web3 Rails. Now, I''ll make something very clear on this stage. It''s not like Work Jumbo is going into these areas and saying, hey guys, look, let me tell you about cryptocurrency, Web3, Solana, Bitcoin, etc. Nah, they''re already using it. The average population of the regions that we''re dealing with is less than 25 years old. One of the youngest demographics there is. Now, if you look at these demographics, what are they more susceptible to? Higher risk and accepting digital payment methods. In Africa, in Kenya, M-Pesa, amazing. Strictly in Kenya. In Brazil, PICS, digital payment methods, QR codes, just like how we would use crypto payment rails. Amazing. But at the end of the day, they''re very fractionalized, segregated, and only within one country or government. And maybe as y''all are on crypto Twitter, you can see with Argentina, with some other Latin American countries, even if you want to implement something super amazing, you might work with some bad actors and not be able to do so. So, Jumbo, what we are super proud is we come into these regions and we''re essentially building a credit profile for these users. Where, right now, out of, let''s say, the 1 million phones, 850k plus phones sold, we have a very active user base of over 300k users, wallet addresses. Now, what does that mean? Number one, they spend over five hours DAU on our phone. How much time do you spend on your phone? Over five hours, it''s essentially your primary phone. Number two, you''re using this phone and earning money. This might be your main method of providing or et cetera. So, we call it the phone that pays you. So, the Jumbo app. You come into the Jumbo phone, there''s 20 applications. Only one of the 20 is your Jumbo app. It''s your 13-chain, multi-chain wallet. It''s your questing platform. It tells you exactly what to do in other applications, which are all pre-selected, curated Web3 partners. I see some in the space here. Appreciate your support. And you will be able to earn their tokens. But even if you give Bitcoin to someone in Venezuela, they don''t care what they''re going to do with Solana or Bitcoin. They''re not going to go on-chain and airdrop farm. They''re not going to provide liquidity to Rails. They might use Sonic SVM. We know about that. But at the end of the day, they need their local currency. Right? So, that is what Jumbo is here to provide, these Rails. Now, I want to take a moment here and just thank, you know, a lot of our partners. If you want to own the entire sector in crypto, all the more power to you. It''s an amazing strategy. At the end of the day, though, we want to work with the most competent at each of their sectors. You go into gaming, we have Matrix Fire pre-installed, listed, fully liquid tokens. Fire, you get to level 5, Web3 FPS game, you earn their tokens. You want to transact in wallets, we provide you a wallet infrastructure and you can spend time, transactions, and you earn those tokens. So, at the end of the day, all of our payment rails, all of our on-ramp off-ramps is through SPL technology. So, I couldn''t thank the Solana ecosystem enough to have us over here. Now, if you look at the Jumbo phone, light blue, $99 US dollars, stay tuned. I got my colleague in the back. We might have a raffle in the future. Today, you can earn a Jumbo phone yourself. And the last point I want to touch on, because I think I''m getting close to eight minutes, I needed more than six, is Jumbo today is the largest deep-in infrastructure foundational layer. We have over 800,000 compute nodes with over 40 million gigawatts of capable storage. And this is something you can tap in. We essentially solved the moat of supply chain and manufacturing, where supply chain is in the East, but most of the golden market is in the West. And no one uses hardware as a golden market for a very specific reason. Software scales, right? VCs invest in software. No one invests in hardware, because manufacturing is just that hard. So, very proud of our team, 24-7, sleeping at factories, solving the issue of supply chain, manufacturing, working with three factories, over a million orders. So, super proud to announce here today some of our future pipelines. You know, some of the logos here, y''all might already be familiar with, from meme coins to some of the most largest onboarding portals like Phantom. But please stay tuned. And if I''m going to leave here with just one thing for everyone to know, Jumbo is launching its own satellite in 2025. What does this mean? Currently, we are hardware resistant, where over 800,000 devices, hardware we pre-install, we disrupted the duopoly of Google and Apple. We can pre-install apps, and we''re the closest touchpoint to the end consumer. But launching the satellite gives us connectivity, essentially, to all of our devices 24-7, adding all this compute power into one large database. Thank you very much. I think I''m up on time. They''re going to kill me. Appreciate y''all. Thank you. Hey, everyone. I''m Dean. Today, I''m going to talk about something really cool. So we recently made the news in January this year with a quantum-proof solution for Solana. So this is going to be a little bit more technical. I heard some people here are a little bit more technical. So let''s get into it. If you haven''t met me before, my name''s Dean. This is some of the things I do. I am the co-founder and chief scientist of Zeus Network. We are taking Bitcoin and putting it on Solana. When I say Bitcoin on Solana, I don''t just mean the coin, but I mean the entire protocol. We''ve got Taproot. We''ve got Schnorr signatures. We''ve got the whole thing. So it''s a fully deep integration into the L1. I''m also a cryptography researcher at Jupyter Research. I''m also the DevRel to the Solana Foundation MCM region. So if you are a local project and you need support for your projects or you have technical issues, please feel free to reach out. This is a service that we provide for people here. And the last one is something I''d like to announce today, which is BlueShift. This is a new initiative that I''m launching just to improve the state of essentially education on Solana. See, we''ve seen like a lot of people coming into the ecosystem and we''ve not been able to sort of keep up with the provision of resources for people trying to learn how to build stuff on Solana. So, yeah, you can find us at BlueShiftGJ on Twitter. So I''m going to get into the talk for today. So at the end of last year, we got some FUD. You know, what''s new? We get a lot of FUD in Solana. We love it. It''s where we''re at our best because we love to, we love to, we love to, you know, hit back. So, yeah, Solana will be the first casualty of Quantum. It was posted by someone whose blockchain does 10 transactions per second or something. So, 10 days later, I posted this tweet and it went incredibly viral. It was all over crypto news and everything. A bunch of people were hitting me up like, hey, you''re like on the news in Argentina or something. I''m like, okay, cool. So what does this mean? So Solana is an extremely capable and flexible protocol that''s actually able to do a whole lot of stuff, especially if you know how to abuse it a little bit. So this solution is called the Solana Winternet''s Vault and it is a way for us to basically make Solana quantum proof today so that it would enable you to store your funds safely and resist quantum attacks. So why is this a problem in the first place? Well, there''s this algorithm called Shor''s algorithm and basically it means if you manage to solve a decoherence and build a large enough quantum computer, you''re able to leverage this algorithm to essentially accelerate factorization of numbers. So that enables you to, for a public key, solve what the private key would be for that by being able to search large ranges of numbers at the same time. So this is not a threat today. It might not be a threat tomorrow, but it is coming in the next, you know, decade or so. And so then there''s the question of like, what would you do if, let''s say, a nation state or some evil actor who is very well funded actually managed to achieve quantum supremacy and there was a zero-day attack? Well, it turns out that Solana is actually capable of supporting something called Winternet''s one-time signatures. Now, it''s quite ironic because Winternet''s signatures are actually a variant of Lamport signatures. And does anybody know what the micro tokens of Solana are called? They''re called Lamports. Yeah. So it''s actually quite ironic. We can use Lamport signatures to secure Lamports and other things. So it starts off by basically we generate 32 random 256-bit scalars. Scalar is just a fancy word for number. So it''s like generating 32 private keys instead of one private key. And then to generate a public key, all we do is we hash our private key values 256 times with a secure hashing algorithm like SHA-256 or Ketchak. So as you can see on the left-hand side, we''ve got the private key. On the right-hand side, we''ve got the public key. And if we hash 256 times, the number on the left makes the number on the right. And because hashing is a one-directional function, we''re not able to actually reverse that easily. So then we can leverage this property to actually generate signatures. So how we generate a signature is we have a message that we pass into the same hashing function. And out of that, we''ll get a thing that''s 32-byte outcome, right, the hash. And each of those 32 bytes, right, they are 8 bits. In 8 bits, there is 256 numbers, 0 to 255, right? So if we take these numbers from our signature, from our hash of our message, right, and we then feed them into that private key, instead of hashing 256 times, we hash 256 minus n times, n being those 32 numbers that we just got out of our message hash, then we end up with something that''s actually in a middle point between the private key and the public key. And so if we have a look, if we put them together, right, if our number was 163, right, and then we pair that with our private key, then actually for us to verify the same public key, right, to get to 163, it''s 256 minus n hashes. If we just add n hashes to that intermediate hash, we''re actually able to get to the public key on the right-hand side. And so this enables us to use hash-based signatures, which fortunately are not really subject to quantum attacks. The best algorithm against this is Grover''s algorithm, which is only quadratically better than classical computing, meaning a 256-bit security algorithm would be 128 bits, which is still above the NIST standard for cryptography safety. Now, there are some limitations that you have to deal with because while Solana is very good at computing and it''s very flexible, it does have some inherent limitations. The main one is actually the transaction size limit. So a transaction has 1,232 bytes that you''re able to use and a Winternet signature is 1,024 bytes. That doesn''t leave a lot of space for us to do a whole lot more other than verify our signature. But thankfully, there is actually a really nice solution because the public key and the signature are both just 32, 256-bit hashes, we''re actually able to merkelize them. And so if we merkelize these hashes, we can supply just the left side as you can see here with just the things that are in pink there. Those are our signature values, right? And then on the right-hand side, we just have the pairing hash that we would merkelize up to from the right-hand side of the signature. By doing this, we can split the signature into two gracefully and still recover our private key, the green dot up there. This enables us to actually unlock all kinds of really interesting use cases. Some of the most interesting ones, I would say, are multi-sigs, so adding quantum signing to an existing signature scheme, upgrade authority for programs so that if there were a quantum zero day, you couldn''t have your program stolen from you, minting tokens, escrow vaults. This is also compatible with hardware wallets in the same way as you would use a derivation key to derive a private key using your Trezor or your Ledger or whatever. You can actually just derive 32 of them and you can get the same sort of protocol. So this is actually totally compatible with a whole bunch of existing things and it just shows the versatility and flexibility of the protocol. That''s about all for today, guys, but if you have any questions, please feel free to come up to me later and yeah, go build something on Solana. All right. GM, Richard Liu, Dr. Payfai, human finance co-founder, and the tech is a little bit different from what I have, so let''s see. In 2024, Payfai pick up really strong momentum and it started off from here, Hong Kong. In April, Li Li Li, chairwoman of Solana Foundation introduced a concept of Payfai and the human and the human and Solana decided to team up together to drive Payfai to mainstream. In September, we co-hosted the first ever Payfai Summit. Although it was a new concept, we had over 2,000 people sign up and had really great fun, great sharing. And even two days ago, we had the second Payfai Summit here in Hong Kong. Anybody who have ever been to, show your hand if you attended any Payfai Summit? Not in this corner. Okay, one. Thank you. We''re going to do more. Hopefully, more of you guys will attend the conference. In December, Missouri surprised all of us, including myself, by highlighting Payfai as one of the key trends for 2025 because it''s nearly too new. We did not expect to go that quick to be picked up by Missouri. What surprised myself was the most was actually I''m not very active on Twitter, but in my quote, my picture, my handle was highlighted by the report, Dr. Payfai. That was very, very amazing. Then, in January, went on to release the first Payfai report. And that''s really how the concept picked up more and more very, very quickly. Last month, human released itself its own Payfai ecosystem map and over 60 companies are actively building on Payfai and we see that number growing every month. So then, the question would be, natural, all those are great, great momentum. What is Payfai? Especially with our deck. What is Payfai? Why do I care? Why does crypto industry need to care? Payfai is basically using blockchain to revolutionize payments and financing. and because you think about if there is one thing that is really unique about crypto, that is a blockchain. What is it? It''s moving money from point A to point B in the world in subseconds or in seconds. That''s amazing. That enables you to disrupt all kinds of existing payments and financing applications from credit card to trade financing to cross-border payments. All those are adding together is $30 trillion business today. And we expect Payfai is able to disrupt all those industries and substantially innovate the product experience and create real value for the world. Because you create real value for the real world, you can command some kind of service fee that allow us to be able to bring that fee on chain and we, for example, in Huma, we are able to generate a double-digit yield that is then if the people will have been working very hard to ask what is crypto''s real world impact? I would here declare Payfai is your answer for it because all the value potentially can create all the, you know, financial returns can create it to the people participating into it. That''s one. And second one is really is think about the crypto generally is working more in isolation. It''s on bubble. But if there is one industry that the entire industry is embracing blockchain, what is it? It''s payments. You think about around the world, no matter MasterCard, Visa, you know, PayPal, you know, anti-financial from west to east. Everybody is embracing, everybody is moving forward. Here, I want to declare that, you know, in five years, if all any major payment company, if they don''t embrace the PayPal, in five years, they will become obsolete. Right? So, not only, you know, okay, great. Thank you. Thank you. So, I jump forward on this one. So, for PayPal, it''s not only you have all this amazing experience creating real value, but also it can enable a lot of amazing, you know, game-changing innovations. So, one of the innovations that I personally feel super excited is T plus zero. For those ones who are not from financial industry, this is basically cross-border settlement. How long does it take? Today, you use a sweep. most of the transactions take three or four days to settle. And that''s slow. That''s more like a dire up, the internet connection. Remember those days? But, think about this, that one from that to broadband or from your, let''s say, the old trains to bullet trains, the entire world changes. And here, from T plus zero, T plus three to T plus zero, you''re going to see the entire financial system across the world get totally transformed. For individuals, three days may not matter as much. If you''re in a supply chain, if you''re in a capital intensive business, that matters a lot. So, I already covered this part, that not only the commercial sector is moving, all the governments are moving, right, from Switzerland to Middle East, to Hong Kong, Singapore, all kinds of friendly crypto, you know, payments, and stable coin regulations have been pushing. The government have been inspiring everybody to work on this. In the past, you would think the U.S. is lagging behind. That changed in last November. Now the president wants to make the U.S. as a center of, you know, crypto capital. And Elon just recently pushed, trying to get government spending all on chain. Think about this. That was unthinkable six months ago. And now it''s in real talk. And if government can spend in, can go on chain, any type of payments can go on chain, that will be massive disruption. So here, with all those movement, with the intrinsic value of pay-fi, with all the external environment, here I want to say, 2025 is a year of pay-fi. Are you guys ready for it? Year of pay-fi, 2025. So, to help with the drive the pay-fi movement, Solana Foundation and Huma have decided to team up together to host five more pay-fi summit in 2025, alongside major crypto or payment conferences. So, looking forward, see you guys in some of those conferences. Enough of the pay-fi mega ecosystem, then question would be, what is Huma? And Huma is the first pay-fi network. And we have mainly two parts. Number one is a very powerful financing layer, enable all kinds of structural financing. Then, on top of that, we have all kinds of applications, from credit card, cross-border payments, to trade financing, to deep in financing, all kinds of applications. Of course, we work together with Solana, with stablecoin, different layers, drive the innovation in the entire ecosystem. And, well, the fast-growing pay-fi network, we have already processed over $3.2 billion on-chain transaction, with zero credit default. Not only that, we provide highly competitive and sustainable yield. Today, if you go to Huma''s website, you will see that''s a yield, stable yield, somewhere 13%-19%, plus our basic points mapped to token rewards in the future. If you look at it, you see an all-come, you know, and all those are single-digit yield. The Huma yield, why I call it sustainable? Because all those yields are from we deploy the capital to real-world payment transactions, help them become better, we charge fees. all those yield coming from real-world earnings, not purely, not from the token emissions. That''s why we believe that''s sustainable. And crypto world, if we want to go to the next level, we need that level of sustainability. And here, you know, if you check out on Huma''s website, we opened the pool two days ago. I want to give everybody here who attended PayFest Summit all consensus opportunity to participate. Unfortunately, I have bad news to share. The pool just filled in two days. But don''t be disappointed. We''re going to open a new pool by the end of the month again. So if you want to follow up, follow up us on Twitter or Discord, you''re going to see it. And whenever the pool is ready, you can jump in. So with that, I''m going to share what''s coming next. So, so far, we have built all the foundation for, you know, Huma finance. and all kinds of powerful pools. Next, what''s coming very soon, we can launch permissionless so that everybody can participate and also with permissionless that will unlock us to integrate with all the DeFi composability. That means we''re able to bring that double-digit yield from real world and inject into all the DeFi ecosystem, make an entire ecosystem much more powerful. and we''re going to have our LP token called, you know, PayFest strategy token to go live on Jupiter so that you can get instant liquidity and also Huma token with Bila Solana token and the first on Jupiter LFG follow up with exchanges. That wraps up my presentation. Thank you, everyone. If you want to check out follow Huma finance. Thank you.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('real_world_assets_and_the_never_ending_search_for_yield', 'Real World Assets and The Never Ending Search for Yield', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' all right hi everyone welcome to our stage my name is Julian Kwan I''m co-founder and CEO of two licensed real-world asset token platforms InvestorX out of Singapore and IXS out of the Bahamas today we''re going to talk about yield and what has happened in the history of digital assets there''s a whole bunch of different kind of things to explore I think just quickly before I let the guys introduce when we think about I think yield in the space of digital assets and crypto over the years it''s predominantly been a lot of you know stake token a and get rewards back in token a and a lot of crypto to crypto the next evolution here is the real asset tokens which are essentially you know tokenized treasuries tokenized money market funds etc most of them are securities but then they''re they''re paying off sort of interest rates and whatnot so I think there''s been a lot of different evolutions and today we''re going to ask a couple of the experts over here what they''ve seen try and give you guys a quick very quick six years in in 20 minutes and then hopefully some time for some questions so Melvin do you want to quickly introduce yourself and QCP thanks thanks Julian afternoon everyone my name is Melvin I''m the CEO of QCP QCP is the leading digital asset partner in Asia and what we''ve been always doing is really helping to put digital assets on balance sheets whether it''s a corporate an investor on individual what we''ve done in the recent times is that we were the first designated market maker for Beudel which is the BlackRock tokenized money market fund and we believe that this is the future of finance thanks for having me and Lazo welcome yeah thanks for having me Julian so I''m Lazo Sabo the co-founder and CEO of Kiln and Kiln we are the leading also leading company on-chain rewards platform which means we offer staking and DeFi to a lot of institutions in the space exchanges custodians wallet new banks asset managers and we have more than 13 billion assets are yielding today so thank you very much for having me yeah so why don''t we jump in so maybe you guys could share your thoughts on what yield products in the digital assets space have you seen you know kind of a summary over the years bit of an evolution what failed what succeeded and give the the audience a bit more color around that I''ll start first and I think many of many of us us who are in in this sector for a while now would be a quite happy it''s the 19th of February so 18th of February had a lot of significance for many who are returning money who will return money from the FTX and that was actually the first version of yield if you remember they were saying that if you left if you kind of staked or left it with me you''ll be yielding but that was a very traditional credit product that didn''t work out very well and I think what we''re seeing as we evolve as we''ve seen tokenized money market fund staking as a product I think these are coming through as what we deem as a yield that came from where you understand the economic activity that you''re doing I think fundamentally to to all the things that we do it''s important to understand the underlying business the underlying use of of the funds and I think we''re coming to that phase and it''s great it''s great to to see this this evolution yeah and on our perspective at kiln we focus very much on on-chain yields so on-chain yield for us started with staking staking you know us for the ones without that don''t know what staking is is you locked your your native assets on proof of stake blockchain to validate transaction and in exchange get some rewards from the inflation and and the network fees of the protocol you validate so if there and Solana are sticking protocols and you can stick your a thermon Solana again rewards in return so 2018 2020 it was pretty much of a retail sticking approach where you would invest in ICO and in stake to your favorite validator 2020 and onwards you would start to stay from your favorite platform the exchanges though it was still very complex for exchanges to up to our first taking that''s why they would prefer to offer centralized lending and Genesis and and the FTX events kind of collapsed a big part of this model and then since then we''ve seen DeFi for sure in in 2020 2021 emerging with liquid staking lending boring and the last year new forms of yields first one is restaking which is you know a narrative that we we can talk about it which is essentially a structured product on on on your state assets and the second one for me on top of our degrees that we''re going to talk about our fixed rates you and as the market get more and more institutionalized you know investors users would like to have more predictive predictability in the yields and more have more fixed rates yeah so we''ve seen some pretty incredible blow-ups and failures in the space over the last couple of years maybe you guys could answer the question like what were a lot of those problems and have they been solved and the new products that are coming out like what''s the difference today 2025 I think I think the the biggest difference between the products then and now is that the products are being sold now on real proper use cases I think there were too many narratives and if you thought about how the way the products are being marketed and discussed the channels I think that''s that''s materially changed and that reflects maturity in the in the ecosystem I think what we''re seeing is that you''re not going to have lots of people trying to use discord and twitter to just drive emotions into into what we deem as a yield or product so I think that that for me is a big big difference what hasn''t really worked in the past has been you know what we say like you said right stake something your your returns in something else and you''re just selling yeah it''s the same token something else or you''re liquidating and you''re saying oh you''re saying oh my returns is 30 percent because that token went to the moon I think that''s not proper risk and reward and I think that that''s actually a liquidity game so that''s not real yield if you would ask me it''s who''s the last one out of that building so what we''re seeing now I think is really changed I think investors and people involved should always ask this very fundamental question right where is it coming from for those that are new to the space that the old school model was launch an ICO and then the platform try to tie up the tokens and reduce the liquidity to drive the price so you''d stake the token a and you get the rewards in token a and it goes great when things are going up and then it''s a house of cards when things are going down yeah yeah yeah yeah I think the FTX collapse in 2022 show that a lot of the exchanges would offer centralized lending as yields right you would have Bitcoin you would have a theorem would have Solana we offer you from five to 10% and in the background five to ten percent and in the background it was you know genesis taking your money and lending it to to other companies such as ftx or lamina we''ve seen the limit of that because it''s quite it was quite opaque how the money was managed how the risk was managed what was the counterpart it could be risky crypto companies in that sense and the reason you wouldn''t see the safest yield in crypto which is taking is because even in 2022 it was still very much complex for an exchange or wallet or custodians to offer staking to their users i think we''ve kind of fixed this problem now um on most of the your favorite exchange most of your favorite wallets if you''re an institution using you know you''re a qualified custodian or a custody solution you can access staking easily um via api with the right reporting uh and companies like us are providing this now what needs to be fixed is on and by the way if you look at stakeable assets 50 of these assets are staked so it''s it''s already a very mature market if you have soul if you are eat there''s already high chances you''re already staking them on a low risk basis but then what''s still missing is the uh i would say the defy yields or other bs if you''re a stable coin you have only seven percent chances to yield them uh so it''s it''s still a very mature market because on most of these platforms these stable coin yields usdc usdt other stable coins um are not available securely uh you know in a simple manner there''s too many choices so i think it feels that through different yield sources boring lending hardware raise uh this will be the the next two or three years problem that will need to be fixed um you know accessing stable coin yields more easily if you''re via your favorite platform yeah that''s a good point so and most of the stable coins are uh at least if we just focus on the big ones usdt usdc they''re paying no uh then no yields about two three years ago we were looking at our platforms how do we make uh real asset tokens not usdc if they see i''m talking about a tokenized treasury or tokenized share of a company make it more usable where could you stake it and earn those rewards and it had never really been done before i found the only thing i could find online was a one-page research paper that was actually launched by copper the custody company when i tracked it all the way down it was a guy living on mykonos who just came up with ideas and they weren''t actually doing it but the point of the story was he said we''ve got to get to a point where this whole yield is not just crypto and we''ve got to add real asset tokens and then we''ll see this huge explosion of growth so you just touched on it then but back back study at melbourne lake what what what are you seeing now that is now coming we''re seeing on chain wise at least the real asset tokens that have found product market fit most of the wall street assets uh but there''s a lot of stuff going on private credit private debt real estate what what do you think is is changing now related to yield and bringing you know real crypto tokens with real world asset tokens and how that''s going to unfold because that that''s just this enormous uh growth industry that''s like a day two yeah you know i think for for most of us sitting you know and thinking about real world assets and and tokenization what does it really mean for me uh as an asset holder um i think what we''re not understood is the power of the liquidity value of having that token in your ownership and what does that mean for example today if you buy a share the share is not in your wallet it''s being held somewhere else but it''s being provided to the rest of the market as liquidity for return and i think tokenization and bringing real world assets onto that actually returns that economic return of providing liquidity uh to the market back to the market back to the owner of the holder and it''s similar to what kiln is doing in terms of staking you''re staking your ease to support a network you could be staking your your apple token into the network to support the the liquidity of it and the economic return actually goes back to you that''s what i think is going to be the future what''s changed is that now the the the liquidity has changed why we started to use property as the first thing to try let''s put rwa wine these are not liquid enough but with the tokenized money market fund that we''ve done with uh with black rock this is now we''re talking about scale and we''re talking about people who are willing to to hold on to it who''s going to have a bit bigger portion and then we start to build products on top of it we try to give the uh you know you give you give the return back to the the holder of the asset so i think that''s going to be the the proliferation that we''re going to see yeah i think um it''s funny to see the the comparison between staking and defi and real world assets because uh staking was a fairly easy problem to solve for the end user you had if you have if you have sold you can earn three percent on if you can earn 10 percent on so um there''s not that many options when you have usdc or usdt what where do you put your money do you put your money on ave on compound on morfo on on though t-bills tokenized um do you put your your money on arbitrum on optimism on ethereum that even on these three d5 protocols in three different chains might have three different different yields so there''s many many many more opportunities and uh yields and rewards differences so i guess what needs to be fixed is just um abstraction if you have um usdc you are on your favorite exchanges wallet uh custodian and we offering you a five to ten percent uh rewards opportunity four point five percent because if the boring lending yields are below the t-bills then you know you''re gonna you''re gonna touch a t-bill and higher if if you go on your favorite uh oh sorry on on the blue chip boring lending protocols that might offer you higher yields during bear markets because sorry bull market because you''re in bull market usually boring and lending yields are higher than t-bills so i think abstraction and reporting is the first first problem to solve the other problem to solve is volatility rates um on in d5 yields you sometimes have um a yield that is at five percent one day and it''s going to be at 15 percent the other day so this this very unpredictable way of getting rewards uh in d5 is um not reassuring for 99 of the users or 99 of the institutions so i think what we''ll you''ll see emerging is uh actually you know um anchoring in a four or five or ten percent yield over 12 months and and then in the background it will use real world assets or you will use more uh d5 yields uh combined right but there will be a complete abstraction one or three choices to the end user because today you have 20 or 30 different choices you don''t know exactly what to choose yeah so a lot of terminology in in crypto is is either a similar or different word but basically just naming a service that we use in financial markets right tradfi so i just wanted to get your opinions on you know real world asset um tokens this whole new use case for yield generation whether it''s real estate or treasuries uh we''ve got larry fink wall street coming in we''ve got ondo uh coming from the defy side we''ve got blackrock coming from the the tradfi side like where who do you think is going to win this what do you think is going to go on there you''re probably going to say blackrock yeah that''s a tough one just i actually i actually i actually think um and i was a long believer of this uh people used to say well there was a time that crypto was going to buy over the banks uh right back back in the 20 21 but i think it was always the coming together of the two worlds uh and and i think we''re seeing it um um what tokenization as a concept brings forward and how it discounts the future is that it is going to increase the ability of the individual to raise liquidity for very illiquid assets how if today you''re holding on to your property you''re getting a mortgage that''s your liquidity but if you could start saying i''ve got my house in the tokenized way i''ve put it up for into a staking kind of a situation that''s going to change the world so and that would need both the traditional side of finance to provide the liquidity and the digital side to provide the infrastructure i don''t know it''s a question for you i i really don''t have the answer who will be the winners of real world assets issuance tomorrow is it the blackrock infinity of the world or will you have much more decentralized uh you know issuance um i guess julian you you''re very familiar with this uh ecosystem having an issuance platform yourself so what do you think blackrock fidelity or newcomers yeah so we''ve got a situation where the the real product market fit in rwa is back at wall street we''ve gone all the way back and that''s come about because crypto is so volatile where do people earn yield sitting on stable coins uh well they started buying tokenized treasuries uh that were on chain uh the banks were talking about this for many years doing their own private chain you know no one really cared there were a couple of private chain protocols they failed um it had to go on public chain and now larry thinks talking about that''s the only way forward so but the point is that we always saw this convergence where the the trad fi guys would start selling crypto they would start tokenizing rwa for efficiency because they''re closed wall banks and gardens they don''t they''re not going to touch the defy guys but if they can save money which they can there''s a lot of studies out there now um by using tokens versus paper they do it so they''ve been doing that now conversely the defy guys were always going to come for the rwa you saw this in 2021 ftx binance bitfinex they launched tokenized stocks which are rwa they just didn''t do it with guys like us so they had no licenses so they pulled them down now we''re having that 2.0 moment uh coinbase is out in abu dhabi building an rwa exchange that''s probably more because of the sec problems but you''ll probably see them come out in the us later this year with rwa crypto.com has been buying broker dealers around the world so they''re going to add rwa to the tokens and you know we''ve just partnered up with uh with the super app in japan line it''s a fintech messaging app 200 million users and we''re the rwa partner so so they''re adding more products right um and on the other side as well you''ve got um you you could see that these the crypto exchanges who are who are selling digital tokens bitcoin ethereum altcoins stable coins we''re always going to want to sell more things just once they''ve got these big audiences so another thing we''ve done recently partnered with four uh crypto exchanges in southeast asia the 25 million users can buy reward asset tokens because the crypto guys don''t have the licenses but the takeaway is that trad fi has been coming full speed uh towards the space and and and defies as well so i think ultimately yeah you''re going to start seeing more coinbase versus you know jp morgan as the fight versus too much but but either way that there''s there''s a lot of different assets out there that there''s a technical problem with trad fi the australian stock exchange tried to build their own rwa exchange failed new york stock exchange tried to do the thing failed hundreds of minutes there''s too many middlemen in the way getting paid and they do not want to get out of the way so you basically have to start a brand new system which is sort of where we''re involved but um there''s a lot to talk about there but we''ll keep going um so this isn''t financial advice of course but like from a practical perspective maybe you guys can give some um ideas to everyone here about like yield like where where do you get yield for stable coins now what are some of the platform names like what are some of the products out there and try to give a bit more color to that yeah i well our business isn''t really um derivatives and that''s where where our strong suits are and our thesis is very simple um when we were looking at credit um you were you were lending to outright unsecured to to an exchange for four percent uh my question back is why don''t you monetize the volatility of this token that everyone''s so scared of and if you think about that if if you''re looking at monetization of volatility your returns are north of ten percent easily depending on your risk appetite um another simple way to get yield is to understand that see the market structures um so one of the things that we did with with uh with budo was really using it as as underlying to create to take advantage of some of these basis trades that we''ve been hearing so much about so i think these are simple ways uh from from a more market structure style uh you know to to get to get yield that you understand what you''re trying to monetize yeah i mean our um mission is is now to make sure you get access to boring lending yields when you have usdc usdt or your favorite stable coin um from your favorite platform your exchange custodians wallets um and that''s on you know ave compound more for many other boring lending protocols but these are the the three main ones for example and um as people want to leverage in bull market you get interesting yields uh from five to to fifteen percent uh for the for the for the highest and and riskest one and uh you already see that most of these pairs are backed by rwas i think next year you will see the the rwas and the t bills rates a bit all uh leading the the path but but not only uh being the default yields uh as you know these boring lending yields will go down and um and early ways will will be the primary um um strategy that that you might uh access to again from your favorite dashboard from your favorite uh platform um that''s coming so i think uh you know related to rwa like what what is uh what we''ve been kind of seeing what''s interesting as well which i mean a lot of people here probably live in you know new york singapore hong kong developed markets easy to buy uh financial instruments uh that''s certainly not the case in the majority of the world um vietnam indonesia whatever countries in in latam a lot of these buyers can''t get it so um i was just looking at mr over there waving his uh his hat i uh anyway so the point is that there''s a lot of different use cases so when you start to see you start to hear about these these assets like when people started tokenizing treasuries people like what''s the point you can buy them on wall street and it was like well there''s 200 billion dollars of stable coins earning no yield we''ll tether and circle are making the money let''s give them a product so i guess almost coming up to sort of one of the last questions like what what do you guys think instead of the biggest opportunities that''s that''s rolling out like related to yield related to rwa you guys are deep in the space like what are your sort of almost predictions for this year that you think are going to be uh the big stories i think one of the biggest stories this year should would be really uh people understanding that yield can come from good good products like staking good products like uh you know a money market fund but i think uh what''s really missing and what most of us are uh too too distracted by because there are too many tokens in this uh in this in this universe to even understand is that actually if you look at the simple things such as bitcoin ethereum solana there is a lot of uh room for you to monetize the volatility and add that to part of the portfolio i think and wait for more stable developments with regards to what real world assets is coming and because it is coming and then deploy your capital in in that in the risk adjusted way yep i mean i agree on the volatility part i think ethena is a very good example of you know uh interesting basis trade uh yields that was um flowing most of defy last year uh and still continuing to a fewer extents and i think this year we''ll see i mean you know the biggest product market fit in crypto is stablecoin these days um you know latam africa southeast asia um people want to access digital dollar uh and now with a kind of abstraction passkey wallets that can be completely abstracted from from millions of users my mother and my grandmother um once you access digital dollar you access a yield in the background is it tb yields that it''s completely embedded it''s actually a same token that is yielding is it more basis trade uh yields that give you maybe a higher yields than the 4.5 percent up to 10 or 15 percent uh you will see much more access to that to hundreds of millions of users that wouldn''t have access to uh finance and digital dollar before and i think this is what it''s coming this year um even more in you know in a um accelerated manner than last year and that''s very exciting yeah i that before they closed down busd and rich tier is a friend of mine so that was very disappointing three of the top six cryptos of us dollar stable coins uh about a year ago i had a chat with chris perkins as the president of coin fund it''s one of the og crypto funds in the us it''d been lobbying most a group of them lobbying us and i asked him what was the one the one thing that you think or know that no one else really knows so well the one thing is that there''s been bipartisan understanding in america this guy like 12 months ago that stable coins increase us dollar dominance which is what they thought they were losing the bitcoin so they''re going to like let that roll to your point these us dollar stable coins now which are the only current fiat currency that really exists in the stable coin world is going to proliferate and it''s going to grow and as you said if you can get your hands on it''s much easier for someone in an emerging market to get a stable coin than it is to get a real dollar um so that''s quite interesting um we''ve got one one minute left you guys have shared a lot of your experience and really appreciate that i''ll give you 20 30 seconds to tell us a little bit the last closing comments on what what''s in store for qcp this year and and what would you like the audience to take away from today i think i mean for us at qcp we''re focused on building out a regulated business and we think that derivatives is the future uh with where you can get yield uh on top of what''s existing today and i think as the markets develop we''re going to see quite a fair bit of this so i hope you guys start reading up on that bit yeah laza yeah we''re pretty much focused on on staking the past four to three three to four years um making staking yields access to most of your favorite platform and we kind of uh you know succeed that uh now it''s a um massively adopted product and we are one of the largest not the largest company in that space and i think the the next one is definitely making uh simcoin yields accessible to hundreds of millions of users and and that will be um and that will go much beyond staking we call it the saving account for the world and we''ll try to make it happen yeah yeah so i think my last comments is if you want to get uh more knowledge around yield rwa etc the only way to do it is to get started you sign up on platforms you access the newsletters you put some money to work so you actually get your fingers dirty you''ll probably get have a bit of anyone who''s been in crypto that was the whole journey as well and encourage you to to check out their platforms and thank you very much for your time today', 'all right hi everyone welcome to our stage my name is Julian Kwan I''m co-founder and CEO of two licensed real-world asset token platforms InvestorX out of Singapore and IXS out of the Bahamas today we''re going to talk about yield and what has happened in the history of digital assets there''s a whole bunch of different kind of things to explore I think just quickly before I let the guys introduce when we think about I think yield in the space of digital assets and crypto over the years it''s predominantly been a lot of you know stake token a and get rewards back in token a and a lot of crypto to crypto the next evolution here is the real asset tokens which are essentially you know tokenized treasuries tokenized money market funds etc most of them are securities but then they''re they''re paying off sort of interest rates and whatnot so I think there''s been a lot of different evolutions and today we''re going to ask a couple of the experts over here what they''ve seen try and give you guys a quick very quick six years in in 20 minutes and then hopefully some time for some questions so Melvin do you want to quickly introduce yourself and QCP thanks thanks Julian afternoon everyone my name is Melvin I''m the CEO of QCP QCP is the leading digital asset partner in Asia and what we''ve been always doing is really helping to put digital assets on balance sheets whether it''s a corporate an investor on individual what we''ve done in the recent times is that we were the first designated market maker for Beudel which is the BlackRock tokenized money market fund and we believe that this is the future of finance thanks for having me and Lazo welcome yeah thanks for having me Julian so I''m Lazo Sabo the co-founder and CEO of Kiln and Kiln we are the leading also leading company on-chain rewards platform which means we offer staking and DeFi to a lot of institutions in the space exchanges custodians wallet new banks asset managers and we have more than 13 billion assets are yielding today so thank you very much for having me yeah so why don''t we jump in so maybe you guys could share your thoughts on what yield products in the digital assets space have you seen you know kind of a summary over the years bit of an evolution what failed what succeeded and give the the audience a bit more color around that I''ll start first and I think many of many of us us who are in in this sector for a while now would be a quite happy it''s the 19th of February so 18th of February had a lot of significance for many who are returning money who will return money from the FTX and that was actually the first version of yield if you remember they were saying that if you left if you kind of staked or left it with me you''ll be yielding but that was a very traditional credit product that didn''t work out very well and I think what we''re seeing as we evolve as we''ve seen tokenized money market fund staking as a product I think these are coming through as what we deem as a yield that came from where you understand the economic activity that you''re doing I think fundamentally to to all the things that we do it''s important to understand the underlying business the underlying use of of the funds and I think we''re coming to that phase and it''s great it''s great to to see this this evolution yeah and on our perspective at kiln we focus very much on on-chain yields so on-chain yield for us started with staking staking you know us for the ones without that don''t know what staking is is you locked your your native assets on proof of stake blockchain to validate transaction and in exchange get some rewards from the inflation and and the network fees of the protocol you validate so if there and Solana are sticking protocols and you can stick your a thermon Solana again rewards in return so 2018 2020 it was pretty much of a retail sticking approach where you would invest in ICO and in stake to your favorite validator 2020 and onwards you would start to stay from your favorite platform the exchanges though it was still very complex for exchanges to up to our first taking that''s why they would prefer to offer centralized lending and Genesis and and the FTX events kind of collapsed a big part of this model and then since then we''ve seen DeFi for sure in in 2020 2021 emerging with liquid staking lending boring and the last year new forms of yields first one is restaking which is you know a narrative that we we can talk about it which is essentially a structured product on on on your state assets and the second one for me on top of our degrees that we''re going to talk about our fixed rates you and as the market get more and more institutionalized you know investors users would like to have more predictive predictability in the yields and more have more fixed rates yeah so we''ve seen some pretty incredible blow-ups and failures in the space over the last couple of years maybe you guys could answer the question like what were a lot of those problems and have they been solved and the new products that are coming out like what''s the difference today 2025 I think I think the the biggest difference between the products then and now is that the products are being sold now on real proper use cases I think there were too many narratives and if you thought about how the way the products are being marketed and discussed the channels I think that''s that''s materially changed and that reflects maturity in the in the ecosystem I think what we''re seeing is that you''re not going to have lots of people trying to use discord and twitter to just drive emotions into into what we deem as a yield or product so I think that that for me is a big big difference what hasn''t really worked in the past has been you know what we say like you said right stake something your your returns in something else and you''re just selling yeah it''s the same token something else or you''re liquidating and you''re saying oh you''re saying oh my returns is 30 percent because that token went to the moon I think that''s not proper risk and reward and I think that that''s actually a liquidity game so that''s not real yield if you would ask me it''s who''s the last one out of that building so what we''re seeing now I think is really changed I think investors and people involved should always ask this very fundamental question right where is it coming from for those that are new to the space that the old school model was launch an ICO and then the platform try to tie up the tokens and reduce the liquidity to drive the price so you''d stake the token a and you get the rewards in token a and it goes great when things are going up and then it''s a house of cards when things are going down yeah yeah yeah yeah I think the FTX collapse in 2022 show that a lot of the exchanges would offer centralized lending as yields right you would have Bitcoin you would have a theorem would have Solana we offer you from five to 10% and in the background five to ten percent and in the background it was you know genesis taking your money and lending it to to other companies such as ftx or lamina we''ve seen the limit of that because it''s quite it was quite opaque how the money was managed how the risk was managed what was the counterpart it could be risky crypto companies in that sense and the reason you wouldn''t see the safest yield in crypto which is taking is because even in 2022 it was still very much complex for an exchange or wallet or custodians to offer staking to their users i think we''ve kind of fixed this problem now um on most of the your favorite exchange most of your favorite wallets if you''re an institution using you know you''re a qualified custodian or a custody solution you can access staking easily um via api with the right reporting uh and companies like us are providing this now what needs to be fixed is on and by the way if you look at stakeable assets 50 of these assets are staked so it''s it''s already a very mature market if you have soul if you are eat there''s already high chances you''re already staking them on a low risk basis but then what''s still missing is the uh i would say the defy yields or other bs if you''re a stable coin you have only seven percent chances to yield them uh so it''s it''s still a very mature market because on most of these platforms these stable coin yields usdc usdt other stable coins um are not available securely uh you know in a simple manner there''s too many choices so i think it feels that through different yield sources boring lending hardware raise uh this will be the the next two or three years problem that will need to be fixed um you know accessing stable coin yields more easily if you''re via your favorite platform yeah that''s a good point so and most of the stable coins are uh at least if we just focus on the big ones usdt usdc they''re paying no uh then no yields about two three years ago we were looking at our platforms how do we make uh real asset tokens not usdc if they see i''m talking about a tokenized treasury or tokenized share of a company make it more usable where could you stake it and earn those rewards and it had never really been done before i found the only thing i could find online was a one-page research paper that was actually launched by copper the custody company when i tracked it all the way down it was a guy living on mykonos who just came up with ideas and they weren''t actually doing it but the point of the story was he said we''ve got to get to a point where this whole yield is not just crypto and we''ve got to add real asset tokens and then we''ll see this huge explosion of growth so you just touched on it then but back back study at melbourne lake what what what are you seeing now that is now coming we''re seeing on chain wise at least the real asset tokens that have found product market fit most of the wall street assets uh but there''s a lot of stuff going on private credit private debt real estate what what do you think is is changing now related to yield and bringing you know real crypto tokens with real world asset tokens and how that''s going to unfold because that that''s just this enormous uh growth industry that''s like a day two yeah you know i think for for most of us sitting you know and thinking about real world assets and and tokenization what does it really mean for me uh as an asset holder um i think what we''re not understood is the power of the liquidity value of having that token in your ownership and what does that mean for example today if you buy a share the share is not in your wallet it''s being held somewhere else but it''s being provided to the rest of the market as liquidity for return and i think tokenization and bringing real world assets onto that actually returns that economic return of providing liquidity uh to the market back to the market back to the owner of the holder and it''s similar to what kiln is doing in terms of staking you''re staking your ease to support a network you could be staking your your apple token into the network to support the the liquidity of it and the economic return actually goes back to you that''s what i think is going to be the future what''s changed is that now the the the liquidity has changed why we started to use property as the first thing to try let''s put rwa wine these are not liquid enough but with the tokenized money market fund that we''ve done with uh with black rock this is now we''re talking about scale and we''re talking about people who are willing to to hold on to it who''s going to have a bit bigger portion and then we start to build products on top of it we try to give the uh you know you give you give the return back to the the holder of the asset so i think that''s going to be the the proliferation that we''re going to see yeah i think um it''s funny to see the the comparison between staking and defi and real world assets because uh staking was a fairly easy problem to solve for the end user you had if you have if you have sold you can earn three percent on if you can earn 10 percent on so um there''s not that many options when you have usdc or usdt what where do you put your money do you put your money on ave on compound on morfo on on though t-bills tokenized um do you put your your money on arbitrum on optimism on ethereum that even on these three d5 protocols in three different chains might have three different different yields so there''s many many many more opportunities and uh yields and rewards differences so i guess what needs to be fixed is just um abstraction if you have um usdc you are on your favorite exchanges wallet uh custodian and we offering you a five to ten percent uh rewards opportunity four point five percent because if the boring lending yields are below the t-bills then you know you''re gonna you''re gonna touch a t-bill and higher if if you go on your favorite uh oh sorry on on the blue chip boring lending protocols that might offer you higher yields during bear markets because sorry bull market because you''re in bull market usually boring and lending yields are higher than t-bills so i think abstraction and reporting is the first first problem to solve the other problem to solve is volatility rates um on in d5 yields you sometimes have um a yield that is at five percent one day and it''s going to be at 15 percent the other day so this this very unpredictable way of getting rewards uh in d5 is um not reassuring for 99 of the users or 99 of the institutions so i think what we''ll you''ll see emerging is uh actually you know um anchoring in a four or five or ten percent yield over 12 months and and then in the background it will use real world assets or you will use more uh d5 yields uh combined right but there will be a complete abstraction one or three choices to the end user because today you have 20 or 30 different choices you don''t know exactly what to choose yeah so a lot of terminology in in crypto is is either a similar or different word but basically just naming a service that we use in financial markets right tradfi so i just wanted to get your opinions on you know real world asset um tokens this whole new use case for yield generation whether it''s real estate or treasuries uh we''ve got larry fink wall street coming in we''ve got ondo uh coming from the defy side we''ve got blackrock coming from the the tradfi side like where who do you think is going to win this what do you think is going to go on there you''re probably going to say blackrock yeah that''s a tough one just i actually i actually i actually think um and i was a long believer of this uh people used to say well there was a time that crypto was going to buy over the banks uh right back back in the 20 21 but i think it was always the coming together of the two worlds uh and and i think we''re seeing it um um what tokenization as a concept brings forward and how it discounts the future is that it is going to increase the ability of the individual to raise liquidity for very illiquid assets how if today you''re holding on to your property you''re getting a mortgage that''s your liquidity but if you could start saying i''ve got my house in the tokenized way i''ve put it up for into a staking kind of a situation that''s going to change the world so and that would need both the traditional side of finance to provide the liquidity and the digital side to provide the infrastructure i don''t know it''s a question for you i i really don''t have the answer who will be the winners of real world assets issuance tomorrow is it the blackrock infinity of the world or will you have much more decentralized uh you know issuance um i guess julian you you''re very familiar with this uh ecosystem having an issuance platform yourself so what do you think blackrock fidelity or newcomers yeah so we''ve got a situation where the the real product market fit in rwa is back at wall street we''ve gone all the way back and that''s come about because crypto is so volatile where do people

yield in the background is it tb yields that it''s completely embedded it''s actually a same token that is yielding is it more basis trade uh yields that give you maybe a higher yields than the 4.5 percent up to 10 or 15 percent uh you will see much more access to that to hundreds of millions of users that wouldn''t have access to uh finance and digital dollar before and i think this is what it''s coming this year um even more in you know in a um accelerated manner than last year and that''s very exciting yeah i that before they closed down busd and rich tier is a friend of mine so that was very disappointing three of the top six cryptos of us dollar stable coins uh about a year ago i had a chat with chris perkins as the president of coin fund it''s one of the og crypto funds in the us it''d been lobbying most a group of them lobbying us and i asked him what was the one the one thing that you think or know that no one else really knows so well the one thing is that there''s been bipartisan understanding in america this guy like 12 months ago that stable coins increase us dollar dominance which is what they thought they were losing the bitcoin so they''re going to like let that roll to your point these us dollar stable coins now which are the only current fiat currency that really exists in the stable coin world is going to proliferate and it''s going to grow and as you said if you can get your hands on it''s much easier for someone in an emerging market to get a stable coin than it is to get a real dollar um so that''s quite interesting um we''ve got one one minute left you guys have shared a lot of your experience and really appreciate that i''ll give you 20 30 seconds to tell us a little bit the last closing comments on what what''s in store for qcp this year and and what would you like the audience to take away from today i think i mean for us at qcp we''re focused on building out a regulated business and we think that derivatives is the future uh with where you can get yield uh on top of what''s existing today and i think as the markets develop we''re going to see quite a fair bit of this so i hope you guys start reading up on that bit yeah laza yeah we''re pretty much focused on on staking the past four to three three to four years um making staking yields access to most of your favorite platform and we kind of uh you know succeed that uh now it''s a um massively adopted product and we are one of the largest not the largest company in that space and i think the the next one is definitely making uh simcoin yields accessible to hundreds of millions of users and and that will be um and that will go much beyond staking we call it the saving account for the world and we''ll try to make it happen yeah yeah so i think my last comments is if you want to get uh more knowledge around yield rwa etc the only way to do it is to get started you sign up on platforms you access the newsletters you put some money to work so you actually get your fingers dirty you''ll probably get have a bit of anyone who''s been in crypto that was the whole journey as well and encourage you to to check out their platforms and thank you very much for your time today', '["all right hi everyone welcome to our stage my name is Julian Kwan I''m co-founder and CEO of two licensed real-world asset token platforms InvestorX out of Singapore and IXS out of the Bahamas today we''re going to talk about yield and what has happened in the history of digital assets there''s a whole bunch of different kind of things to explore I think just quickly before I let the guys introduce when we think about I think yield in the space of digital assets and crypto over the years it''s predominantly been a lot of you know stake token a and get rewards back in token a and a lot of crypto to crypto the next evolution here is the real asset tokens which are essentially you know tokenized treasuries tokenized money market funds etc most of them are securities but then they''re they''re paying off sort of interest rates and whatnot so I think there''s been a lot of different evolutions and today we''re going to ask a couple of the experts over here what they''ve seen try and give you guys a quick very quick six years in in 20 minutes and then hopefully some time for some questions so Melvin do you want to quickly introduce yourself and QCP thanks thanks Julian afternoon everyone my name is Melvin I''m the CEO of QCP QCP is the leading digital asset partner in Asia and what we''ve been always doing is really helping to put digital assets on balance sheets whether it''s a corporate an investor on individual what we''ve done in the recent times is that we were the first designated market maker for Beudel which is the BlackRock tokenized money market fund and we believe that this is the future of finance thanks for having me and Lazo welcome yeah thanks for having me Julian so I''m Lazo Sabo the co-founder and CEO of Kiln and Kiln we are the leading also leading company on-chain rewards platform which means we offer staking and DeFi to a lot of institutions in the space exchanges custodians wallet new banks asset managers and we have more than 13 billion assets are yielding today so thank you very much for having me yeah so why don''t we jump in so maybe you guys could share your thoughts on what yield products in the digital assets space have you seen you know kind of a summary over the years bit of an evolution what failed what succeeded and give the the audience a bit more color around that I''ll start first and I think many of many of us us who are in in this sector for a while now would be a quite happy it''s the 19th of February so 18th of February had a lot of significance for many who are returning money who will return money from the FTX and that was actually the first version of yield if you remember they were saying that if you left if you kind of staked or left it with me you''ll be yielding but that was a very traditional credit product that didn''t work out very well and I think what we''re seeing as we evolve as we''ve seen tokenized money market fund staking as a product I think these are coming through as what we deem as a yield that came from where you understand the economic activity that you''re doing I think fundamentally to to all the things that we do it''s important to understand the underlying business the underlying use of of the funds and I think we''re coming to that phase and it''s great it''s great to to see this this evolution yeah and on our perspective at kiln we focus very much on on-chain yields so on-chain yield for us started with staking staking you know us for the ones without that don''t know what staking is is you locked your your native assets on proof of stake blockchain to validate transaction and in exchange get some rewards from the inflation and and the network fees of the protocol you validate so if there and Solana are sticking protocols and you can stick your a thermon Solana again rewards in return so 2018 2020 it was pretty much of a retail sticking approach where you would invest in ICO and in stake to your favorite validator 2020 and onwards you would start to stay from your favorite platform the exchanges though it was still very complex for exchanges to up to our first taking that''s why they would prefer to offer centralized lending and Genesis and and the FTX events kind of collapsed a big part of this model and then since then we''ve seen DeFi for sure in in 2020 2021 emerging with liquid staking lending boring and the last year new forms of yields first one is restaking which is you know a narrative that we we can talk about it which is essentially a structured product on on on your state assets and the second one for me on top of our degrees that we''re going to talk about our fixed rates you and as the market get more and more institutionalized you know investors users would like to have more predictive predictability in the yields and more have more fixed rates yeah so we''ve seen some pretty incredible blow-ups and failures in the space over the last couple of years maybe you guys could answer the question like what were a lot of those problems and have they been solved and the new products that are coming out like what''s the difference today 2025 I think I think the the biggest difference between the products then and now is that the products are being sold now on real proper use cases I think there were too many narratives and if you thought about how the way the products are being marketed and discussed the channels I think that''s that''s materially changed and that reflects maturity in the in the ecosystem I think what we''re seeing is that you''re not going to have lots of people trying to use discord and twitter to just drive emotions into into what we deem as a yield or product so I think that that for me is a big big difference what hasn''t really worked in the past has been you know what we say like you said right stake something your your returns in something else and you''re just selling yeah it''s the same token something else or you''re liquidating and you''re saying oh you''re saying oh my returns is 30 percent because that token went to the moon I think that''s not proper risk and reward and I think that that''s actually a liquidity game so that''s not real yield if you would ask me it''s who''s the last one out of that building so what we''re seeing now I think is really changed I think investors and people involved should always ask this very fundamental question right where is it coming from for those that are new to the space that the old school model was launch an ICO and then the platform try to tie up the tokens and reduce the liquidity to drive the price so you''d stake the token a and you get the rewards in token a and it goes great when things are going up and then it''s a house of cards when things are going down yeah yeah yeah yeah I think the FTX collapse in 2022 show that a lot of the exchanges would offer centralized lending as yields right you would have Bitcoin you would have a theorem would have Solana we offer you from five to 10% and in the background five to ten percent and in the background it was you know genesis taking your money and lending it to to other companies such as ftx or lamina we''ve seen the limit of that because it''s quite it was quite opaque how the money was managed how the risk was managed what was the counterpart it could be risky crypto companies in that sense and the reason you wouldn''t see the safest yield in crypto which is taking is because even in 2022 it was still very much complex for an exchange or wallet or custodians to offer staking to their users i think we''ve kind of fixed this problem now um on most of the your favorite exchange most of your favorite wallets if you''re an institution using you know you''re a qualified custodian or a custody solution you can access staking easily um via api with the right reporting uh and companies like us are providing this now what needs to be fixed is on and by the way if you look at stakeable assets 50 of these assets are staked so it''s it''s already a very mature market if you have soul if you are eat there''s already high chances you''re already staking them on a low risk basis but then what''s still missing is the uh i would say the defy yields or other bs if you''re a stable coin you have only seven percent chances to yield them uh so it''s it''s still a very mature market because on most of these platforms these stable coin yields usdc usdt other stable coins um are not available securely uh you know in a simple manner there''s too many choices so i think it feels that through different yield sources boring lending hardware raise uh this will be the the next two or three years problem that will need to be fixed um you know accessing stable coin yields more easily if you''re via your favorite platform yeah that''s a good point so and most of the stable coins are uh at least if we just focus on the big ones usdt usdc they''re paying no uh then no yields about two three years ago we were looking at our platforms how do we make uh real asset tokens not usdc if they see i''m talking about a tokenized treasury or tokenized share of a company make it more usable where could you stake it and earn those rewards and it had never really been done before i found the only thing i could find online was a one-page research paper that was actually launched by copper the custody company when i tracked it all the way down it was a guy living on mykonos who just came up with ideas and they weren''t actually doing it but the point of the story was he said we''ve got to get to a point where this whole yield is not just crypto and we''ve got to add real asset tokens and then we''ll see this huge explosion of growth so you just touched on it then but back back study at melbourne lake what what what are you seeing now that is now coming we''re seeing on chain wise at least the real asset tokens that have found product market fit most of the wall street assets uh but there''s a lot of stuff going on private credit private debt real estate what what do you think is is changing now related to yield and bringing you know real crypto tokens with real world asset tokens and how that''s going to unfold because that that''s just this enormous uh growth industry that''s like a day two yeah you know i think for for most of us sitting you know and thinking about real world assets and and tokenization what does it really mean for me uh as an asset holder um i think what we''re not understood is the power of the liquidity value of having that token in your ownership and what does that mean for example today if you buy a share the share is not in your wallet it''s being held somewhere else but it''s being provided to the rest of the market as liquidity for return and i think tokenization and bringing real world assets onto that actually returns that economic return of providing liquidity uh to the market back to the market back to the owner of the holder and it''s similar to what kiln is doing in terms of staking you''re staking your ease to support a network you could be staking your your apple token into the network to support the the liquidity of it and the economic return actually goes back to you that''s what i think is going to be the future what''s changed is that now the the the liquidity has changed why we started to use property as the first thing to try let''s put rwa wine these are not liquid enough but with the tokenized money market fund that we''ve done with uh with black rock this is now we''re talking about scale and we''re talking about people who are willing to to hold on to it who''s going to have a bit bigger portion and then we start to build products on top of it we try to give the uh you know you give you give the return back to the the holder of the asset so i think that''s going to be the the proliferation that we''re going to see yeah i think um it''s funny to see the the comparison between staking and defi and real world assets because uh staking was a fairly easy problem to solve for the end user you had if you have if you have sold you can earn three percent on if you can earn 10 percent on so um there''s not that many options when you have usdc or usdt what where do you put your money do you put your money on ave on compound on morfo on on though t-bills tokenized um do you put your your money on arbitrum on optimism on ethereum that even on these three d5 protocols in three different chains might have three different different yields so there''s many many many more opportunities and uh yields and rewards differences so i guess what needs to be fixed is just um abstraction if you have um usdc you are on your favorite exchanges wallet uh custodian and we offering you a five to ten percent uh rewards opportunity four point five percent because if the boring lending yields are below the t-bills then you know you''re gonna you''re gonna touch a t-bill and higher if if you go on your favorite uh oh sorry on on the blue chip boring lending protocols that might offer you higher yields during bear markets because sorry bull market because you''re in bull market usually boring and lending yields are higher than t-bills so i think abstraction and reporting is the first first problem to solve the other problem to solve is volatility rates um on in d5 yields you sometimes have um a yield that is at five percent one day and it''s going to be at 15 percent the other day so this this very unpredictable way of getting rewards uh in d5 is um not reassuring for 99 of the users or 99 of the institutions so i think what we''ll you''ll see emerging is uh actually you know um anchoring in a four or five or ten percent yield over 12 months and and then in the background it will use real world assets or you will use more uh d5 yields uh combined right but there will be a complete abstraction one or three choices to the end user because today you have 20 or 30 different choices you don''t know exactly what to choose yeah so a lot of terminology in in crypto is is either a similar or different word but basically just naming a service that we use in financial markets right tradfi so i just wanted to get your opinions on you know real world asset um tokens this whole new use case for yield generation whether it''s real estate or treasuries uh we''ve got larry fink wall street coming in we''ve got ondo uh coming from the defy side we''ve got blackrock coming from the the tradfi side like where who do you think is going to win this what do you think is going to go on there you''re probably going to say blackrock yeah that''s a tough one just i actually i actually i actually think um and i was a long believer of this uh people used to say well there was a time that crypto was going to buy over the banks uh right back back in the 20 21 but i think it was always the coming together of the two worlds uh and and i think we''re seeing it um um what tokenization as a concept brings forward and how it discounts the future is that it is going to increase the ability of the individual to raise liquidity for very illiquid assets how if today you''re holding on to your property you''re getting a mortgage that''s your liquidity but if you could start saying i''ve got my house in the tokenized way i''ve put it up for into a staking kind of a situation that''s going to change the world so and that would need both the traditional side of finance to provide the liquidity and the digital side to provide the infrastructure i don''t know it''s a question for you i i really don''t have the answer who will be the winners of real world assets issuance tomorrow is it the blackrock infinity of the world or will you have much more decentralized uh you know issuance um i guess julian you you''re very familiar with this uh ecosystem having an issuance platform yourself so what do you think blackrock fidelity or newcomers yeah so we''ve got a situation where the the real product market fit in rwa is back at wall street we''ve gone all the way back and that''s come about because crypto is so volatile where do people earn yield sitting on stable coins uh well they started buying tokenized treasuries uh that were on chain uh the banks were talking about this for many years doing their own private chain you know no one really cared there were a couple of private chain protocols they failed um it had to go on public chain and now larry thinks talking about that''s the only way forward so but the point is that we always saw this convergence where the the trad fi guys would start selling crypto they would start tokenizing rwa for efficiency because they''re closed wall banks and gardens they don''t they''re not going to touch the defy guys but if they can save money which they can there''s a lot of studies out there now um by using tokens versus paper they do it so they''ve been doing that now conversely the defy guys were always going to come for the rwa you saw this in 2021 ftx binance bitfinex they launched tokenized stocks which are rwa they just didn''t do it with guys like us so they had no licenses so they pulled them down now we''re having that 2.0 moment uh coinbase is out in abu dhabi building an rwa exchange that''s probably more because of the sec problems but you''ll probably see them come out in the us later this year with rwa crypto.com has been buying broker dealers around the world so they''re going to add rwa to the tokens and you know we''ve just partnered up with uh with the super app in japan line it''s a fintech messaging app 200 million users and we''re the rwa partner so so they''re adding more products right um and on the other side as well you''ve got um you you could see that these the crypto exchanges who are who are selling digital tokens bitcoin ethereum altcoins stable coins we''re always going to want to sell more things just once they''ve got these big audiences so another thing we''ve done recently partnered with four uh crypto exchanges in southeast asia the 25 million users can buy reward asset tokens because the crypto guys don''t have the licenses but the takeaway is that trad fi has been coming full speed uh towards the space and and and defies as well so i think ultimately yeah you''re going to start seeing more coinbase versus you know jp morgan as the fight versus too much but but either way that there''s there''s a lot of different assets out there that there''s a technical problem with trad fi the australian stock exchange tried to build their own rwa exchange failed new york stock exchange tried to do the thing failed hundreds of minutes there''s too many middlemen in the way getting paid and they do not want to get out of the way so you basically have to start a brand new system which is sort of where we''re involved but um there''s a lot to talk about there but we''ll keep going um so this isn''t financial advice of course but like from a practical perspective maybe you guys can give some um ideas to everyone here about like yield like where where do you get yield for stable coins now what are some of the platform names like what are some of the products out there and try to give a bit more color to that yeah i well our business isn''t really um derivatives and that''s where where our strong suits are and our thesis is very simple um when we were looking at credit um you were you were lending to outright unsecured to to an exchange for four percent uh my question back is why don''t you monetize the volatility of this token that everyone''s so scared of and if you think about that if if you''re looking at monetization of volatility your returns are north of ten percent easily depending on your risk appetite um another simple way to get yield is to understand that see the market structures um so one of the things that we did with with uh with budo was really using it as as underlying to create to take advantage of some of these basis trades that we''ve been hearing so much about so i think these are simple ways uh from from a more market structure style uh you know to to get to get yield that you understand what you''re trying to monetize yeah i mean our um mission is is now to make sure you get access to boring lending yields when you have usdc usdt or your favorite stable coin um from your favorite platform your exchange custodians wallets um and that''s on you know ave compound more for many other boring lending protocols but these are the the three main ones for example and um as people want to leverage in bull market you get interesting yields uh from five to to fifteen percent uh for the for the for the highest and and riskest one and uh you already see that most of these pairs are backed by rwas i think next year you will see the the rwas and the t bills rates a bit all uh leading the the path but but not only uh being the default yields uh as you know these boring lending yields will go down and um and early ways will will be the primary um um strategy that that you might uh access to again from your favorite dashboard from your favorite uh platform um that''s coming so i think uh you know related to rwa like what what is uh what we''ve been kind of seeing what''s interesting as well which i mean a lot of people here probably live in you know new york singapore hong kong developed markets easy to buy uh financial instruments uh that''s certainly not the case in the majority of the world um vietnam indonesia whatever countries in in latam a lot of these buyers can''t get it so um i was just looking at mr over there waving his uh his hat i uh anyway so the point is that there''s a lot of different use cases so when you start to see you start to hear about these these assets like when people started tokenizing treasuries people like what''s the point you can buy them on wall street and it was like well there''s 200 billion dollars of stable coins earning no yield we''ll tether and circle are making the money let''s give them a product so i guess almost coming up to sort of one of the last questions like what what do you guys think instead of the biggest opportunities that''s that''s rolling out like related to yield related to rwa you guys are deep in the space like what are your sort of almost predictions for this year that you think are going to be uh the big stories i think one of the biggest stories this year should would be really uh people understanding that yield can come from good good products like staking good products like uh you know a money market fund but i think uh what''s really missing and what most of us are uh too too distracted by because there are too many tokens in this uh in this in this universe to even understand is that actually if you look at the simple things such as bitcoin ethereum solana there is a lot of uh room for you to monetize the volatility and add that to part of the portfolio i think and wait for more stable developments with regards to what real world assets is coming and because it is coming and then deploy your capital in in that in the risk adjusted way yep i mean i agree on the volatility part i think ethena is a very good example of you know uh interesting basis trade uh yields that was um flowing most of defy last year uh and still continuing to a fewer extents and i think this year we''ll see i mean you know the biggest product market fit in crypto is stablecoin these days um you know latam africa southeast asia um people want to access digital dollar uh and now with a kind of abstraction passkey wallets that can be completely abstracted from from millions of users my mother and my grandmother um once you access digital dollar you access a yield in the background is it tb yields that it''s completely embedded it''s actually a same token that is yielding is it more basis trade uh yields that give you maybe a higher yields than the 4.5

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('solana__building_the_world_s_internet_capital_markets', 'Solana_ Building the World_s Internet Capital Markets', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Music Good afternoon Hong Kong! I hope you guys are doing well. Very very excited to be here with you all to talk about really the latest with Solana on this exciting little session we''re going to have on the really building the world''s internet markets. My name is Henry Arsliyan. I''m the co-founder of Nineblocks Capital, one of the market neutral crypto hedge funds regulated in Dubai. I spent 15 years here in Hong Kong, so good to be back here, back home actually on that perspective. We''re going to talk today about a lot of the latest developments on Solana, what''s happening in the ecosystem and the future of Solana. And to do this we''re joined by Lily Liu, the president of the Solana Foundation. Lily, great. Welcome to Hong Kong as well. Thank you Henry. Fun fact by the way Lily, many people know her as the president of the Solana Foundation. One thing you may not know about her, she used to be in the crew team at Stanford in the rowing activity, in the rowing sports, the boats of eight people from what I understand. Hong Kong we have dragon boat, here we go, and you have rowing as well and crew. And it''s very relevant to crypto because what it teaches you is pain tolerance. Pain tolerance and unfortunately we need that a lot in the industry. So Lily, I''m sure a lot of people want to hear from you on what''s happening in the Solana ecosystem. I want to cover a lot of developments on the Solana, on broader markets as well. But maybe to set the scene, can you share with our audience what are some of the latest developments you''re seeing with the Solana ecosystem? And then we''ll dive right in. Well, frankly everything is happening on Solana, right? If you look at every single sector, at some point people have called Solana the DeFi chain, the NFT chain, the gaming chain, the D-Pin chain, the Sablecoin chain, and lately, yes, the Memecoin chain. And so what it really means to be a general purpose L1 is that you have to do the hard thing, which is that you have to have breadth and depth across a full variety of different use cases and verticals that exist in this kind of ever growing industry. But you don''t think, I mean you mentioned Memecoins actually don''t need to bring, they bring a lot of new users. I mean from a data perspective, a lot of the users must be coming from the Memecoin ecosystem I presume, right? They do. Look, it''s no secret that what, 16 years on from when Bitcoin was created, what is the ever present critique that a lot of people have had of this industry? That it''s all just about speculation. And that it''s been, you know, initially Bitcoin was, 2013 was when it got up to like 1300 and people felt a certain way about that. And I''m sure you guys remember the ICO days when DentaCoin was worth a couple billion dollars. And then there was of course the NFT cycle, gaming coin, so on and so forth. So the idea that people want to be able to speculate on stuff on chain is not new. Yeah. So how do you see the future, you know, Lily, let''s say we look a couple years down the line. The last today, today we''ve had a numerous conversation on various L1s and how the ecosystem is growing. What''s your view, let''s say, not only from a Solana perspective, but also yours on the future of like a cross chain and multi L1 ecosystem? Do you believe there''ll be interoperability? Do you believe there''ll be 50 L1s? Like how do you see the future roadmap? Sure. I think there''s going to be, I don''t think you''re going to have the same market kind of dominance allocation as you have. And for example, search or in e-commerce, because I think that the cost to go start market and get to some degree of scale on a new chain is that startup cost. And also the incentive to exit is just a fundamentally different kind of expected value calculation than if you''re building in the Web2 world, whether it''s e-commerce, SaaS or whatever it might be. Right. And, you know, even as those kind of EV calculations come down over time, as there''s more chains and more use case and so on and so forth built out. I think that''s one of the kind of one of many unique dynamics in crypto, which is that it''s open source. Anyone, almost anyone can go and launch a chain. That does not mean that all chains in the same way that not all websites are equivalent. Right. There''s I don''t even know how many millions of websites. And yet there are a few that are hugely dominant. So I think, yes, it''s going to be a multi-chain world. And also what we''ve seen is that because these chains are not just technology, there are also communities and they''re ultimately communities of users. And that is actually what gives coins and chains longevity over time. And so essentially once a coin has a community, they don''t really actually go away. I mean, if you I don''t know how many people have looked at the market cap of, for example, Ethereum Classic, which very few people talk about, or even Bitcoin Gold or Bitcoin Diamond. And they have huge market caps still because of because of sort of the original size of the community they were imbued with and also longevity as well. So I think, yes, it''s going to be a multi-chain ecosystem and recognize that. But, you know, what I think is going to be the most unique about something like Solana is what really drives value. Why are blockchains valuable? Well, I think that it''s always been blockchains have always been about creating global financial infrastructure. Yeah. Right. That is the title of the white paper. It says peer to peer electronic cash system. It does not say digital gold, which is not to say that, you know, that there''s a store value. It''s extremely important for us to kind of for that to be basically the anchor asset of our entire industry. But what about the rest of that vision? Right. Who''s going to be building that and what infrastructure can support that? So that, from my perspective, is what Solana is here to do. That''s why we talk about Internet capital markets being the infrastructure for that. But when you look at the future of Solana, I mean, obviously we''re talking about the world Internet markets, but do you believe each chain will have a specialization or an area they''re mostly focused on? And if for Solana, what do you think that niche will be, if any? Well, I wouldn''t frame it as a niche. I think that if the whole purpose of blockchains is to be global financial infrastructure, then inherently this entire kind of tech stack, this entire purpose of this industry is about creating a financial layer, a financial infrastructure which is accessible to five and a half billion people. Right. The quantity of people that have access to the Internet. And if that''s the case, then really the core function is to have liquidity, right? Yeah. To provide global liquidity. And, you know, one could look at the kind of extreme sort of explosion of interest in speculative use cases and say what that proves out is that if you can tap into the global liquidity of anyone who can log onto the Internet, then you have potentially explosive markets. Yeah. And so I think I don''t see that as actually as a niche. I see that as being the foundational purpose of what we''re all doing here. Yeah. It''s broader than that. You know, I remember when post FTX, a lot of people said, oh, Solana is dead. There''s not in much interest. And obviously Solana has had a great, obviously had rocket choppy couple months, but I mean, it''s been actually quite a successful year or two since FTX, especially. To what do you attribute the success of Solana? Is it the power of the community? Is it the tech? Yeah. Is it the foundation doing a great job? Like what really drove a lot of this? It''s really the tech and the community. And from the outside observer in November 22 and December 22, I can understand why a lot of people looked at Solana and said most certainly dead, right? Most certainly roadkill might come up for a breath or two, but that''s done. But really from the perspective of being inside the community, not much changed, right? People are still building and still had actually doubled down in conviction. And not even that. I will say there are a number of people that in November 22 actually said, I feel excited about this, right? Because we have a chance to continue building what we believe in and really rebuild the ecosystem as well. So maybe it''s just the pain tolerance, right? We talked about earlier. Exactly. Here we go. Rowing comes in. Being crew comes in handy. Out of interest, any regions of the world where you''re seeing more interest on Solana that compare like globally when you guys look at it from a global perspective? Yeah. So Solana, look, open source ultimately just a GitHub repo. We''re all public servants of a GitHub repo is what we all are at the end of the day. So this technology open source is inherently global. That said, it''s something that should feel Chinese in China, should feel American in America, should feel German in Germany and Indian in India, right? So the use cases and what people want to do with the underlying technology will be expressed in the developer community, in the application layer, and the choices that people make. And that''s exactly what it should be. Now, if you ask me, what are the most important markets in crypto? Well, it''s always been the same answer, right? Which are the two large markets that have breadth in talent and in capital? Well, that''s the US and China. Yeah. And over the last four years, I wouldn''t say that both of those markets have been terribly open to crypto. That''s where everything has started from the very beginning. And so it''s kind of like an ebb and flow type of thing. I think since November, when we have a just total sea change and kind of like that US shaped hole in the middle of this industry is now being filled, did a complete 180. Yeah. I think we''re going to see a ton of changes, right? Because what''s happening is the US is just changing the Overton window on every topic, right? Way outside of crypto as well, but also changing kind of where the median point is on crypto regulation, wanting to be a leader in technology, and also seeing stablecoins as being strategic to the US. And I think that''s going to really push quite a number of people around the world. To what extent, from a scale to one to 10, of course, we all know that obviously change in the US is positive for the industry. And we''re all seeing what''s happened, different conversations from stablecoins to strategic reserve discussions to the end of regulation by enforcement as well. What is the main development you are watching in the US you think will have an outsized impact on the, not only on the Solana, but also the broader crypto ecosystem? Yes. I think that certainly there''s going to be a lot of kind of legislation and very specific things that people are looking at, right? Yeah. But the biggest one that already has been signaled is we''re no longer going to persecute the crypto industry, right? Yeah. And we''re no longer going to take this entire group of people just as a class because of some sort of ideological disagreement. And we''re going to say they''re all bad and they should all should be debanked and in indirect ways take the full weight of the state and turn that against this industry. Yeah. Okay, great. So we''re over that. And then I think it''s, well, you know, we''ll see what gets embraced, but I think one that is very aligned is unstablecoins. And so from the US perspective, it''s very clear that the US wants to be dominant in all technologies that matter. And the US is also very interested in extending US dollar dominance and stablecoins are a way of continue to extend the economic sphere of the dollar. I was looking at some charts the other day and there are 50 economies around the world that have over 5% CPI inflation, right? And that accounts for about 1 billion people in the world. And so I think the US kind of just sees this very strategically and potentially even that incremental demand perhaps even being able to affect long term interest rates, which is a big KPI of the Treasury at the moment. Yeah, I can imagine that. You know, one topic, and I''m sure you''ve been asked this multiple times, many people think about Solana, they think about meme coins. And now the last 72 hours, we think about Libra with all the debacle there. To what extent do you believe this whole meme coin, Libra, that''s a noise around, pumped up fun and everything, was positive or negative on the brother Solana ecosystem? Well, I don''t think that Libra is bad for everyone, right? I don''t think there''s any question about that. You don''t think it''s bad? I think it is bad for everyone. It''s bad, yeah, okay. Right, it''s very clearly bad for everyone involved. I think it''s a pretty terrible situation. I don''t think there''s much to discuss there. I think that, now, with meme coins, okay, well that''s, what, anywhere between 20 and 50,000 meme coins a day. Are all of them Libra? No. Are all of them going to be sort of retirement assets you''re going to be holding down, handing down to your children? What? They''re not? Oh, man. But what I think, you know, I hate to go back to regulation again and again, but what''s happened in this industry is, so there''s this technology that sort of remixes money, social connections, a sense of community, and does that global. It''s pretty radical technology at the end of the day, right? Yeah. And has the ability to kind of also recombine aspects of what you would previously have called a transaction token, utility token, and also things that have some sort of yield bearing element to them. And so because of this kind of regulatory uncertainty we''ve had in basically all jurisdictions in the world, what people have been pushed into is they''ve been pushed into the extremes. They''ve been pushed into, well, anything I do that I sort of will, if I engage in sort of good faith innovation around governance mechanisms, on-chain price discovery mechanisms, ways of sort of actually transparently engaging the community in utility governance, whatever, that''s a really risky area to be in. Yeah. Or even if you have a token that represents a share of, let''s call it a fee pool, that''s also considered. So everything that is, that even has a little bit of something in the middle is, well, you better not do that. Otherwise, you basically spend all of your money on lawyers. So let''s push this entire industry to do things where people just throw up their hands at the very beginning and say, I told you it''s worth nothing, never will be worth anything. And I think that that''s actually been the product of the Reikland-Door environment in which we live. Which I, what I think would be a lot more interesting is to explore all of the, you could call them structured products in between, right? And the ability to have a token that entitles you to, for example, some of the fee revenue in some of these protocols, right? That is, that''s always been part of the roadmap of, for example, DeFi. But no one has dared to do that because of just the thicket of, you name it, that would just encounter you on day one. It''s very, but you''re right, Lily, because it''s very ironic in the way regulators, they put the constraints are so hard that it pushes people on the sidelines, right? And that''s what obviously is a lot of interest or, I mean, you could argue for a lot of people that are completely cut off of the system, the meme comments are becoming the way. When it comes to DeFi, actually, do you believe, I presume you''re pretty bullish on the future of DeFi. Any vertical of DeFi you think is very exciting, especially from a Solana perspective? Well, we talk about PayFi a lot. And so to date, DeFi has always been synonymous with trading. The core transaction is a trade of one token for another token. But, you know, the original vision for the space was the peer-to-peer electronic cash system. That''s a transactional economy. It''s fundamentally a payments economy where you''re sending in, let''s call it a token, for a good or service in return. Where is that economy? Why does that not exist on chain? Now, might not be surprised that my answer to that is that has not been able to exist on chain because we haven''t had performant infrastructure. Okay, right? You would expect that would be my answer. But I think that that is the part of, if you think about DeFi more broadly than trading, like truly decentralized finance, like an economy that exists on chain on this kind of global financial infrastructure, then I would say payments is that huge, that''s kind of like our white whale as an industry. And that''s what I''m the most excited about. One last question before we move to the fire round of questions. You obviously run the foundation of one of the biggest L1s right now globally. What is the biggest challenge of running a foundation? It''s a very unique role you have. Maybe just the time zones, right? Never sleep. There''s always someone who wants to talk to you. Yeah. So I think that, I think, you know, the sheer breadth of what is happening. Yeah. So if you think about the range of, you know, on Web 2, just think about the range of people who use the internet and the range of use cases and even just content that exists on the internet. Yeah. Now, at least on the internet, there''s like no one to call like 1-800-TCP-IP. It doesn''t exist. Yeah. Whereas that''s the same case of what happens within Solana. There''s a full range of financial content. And so on one end, you''ll have the money market fund, which is, you know, liked and unobjectable to everyone. And then on the other end, in the current world, you have financial content that a lot of people find to be very controversial. It''s called the meme points, right? Yeah. And so that whole, and you can imagine kind of like, let''s just call it the breadth of humanity and civilization that spans those two ends of the spectrum. And so I think, you know, finding ways to be relevant to that full range, because I think that''s what it means to be global financial infrastructure, right? And so that''s what it means to be this open source protocol that you do need to be accessible, available, and infrastructure for the full range of assets. But it''s also the full range of humanity. The full range of humanity. I love it. So, Lily, we have literally less than two minutes left. My bell is with me back in Hong Kong. I''m going to ask you quick questions, and I want one or two words answers. Okay. You ready? Mm-hmm. You''re back in Hong Kong. What''s your favorite thing in Hong Kong? Eating. Food. The food. Oh. If, well, here you go. Even the sheet is falling. Lily, if you''re not in the crypto industry, what other industry would you be in? Being a tiger mom. A tiger mom. Here we go. As a tiger mom, what is the one course you think kids should go learn right now that you wish you had learned when you were a kid? Oh. Well, all starts and ends with math. Maths. Here we go. That''s a favorite in Hong Kong. Very predictable, yes. This is a tricky one. If you could hold one other coin, non Solana, for the next 10 years and not allowed to sell, what would you hold? Obviously, Bitcoin. Bitcoin. Or Dogecoin. Or Dogecoin. Or Dogecoin. Ha, ha, ha, ha. If you could go back to university today and take one course you wish you had taken, what course would you take? I would have taken many fewer classes and hung out more with my friends. Here we go. Interesting one. Donald Trump gives you a call and wants to put you on their crypto committee. What''s the one advice you give to Donald Trump? Move faster. Move faster. Here we go. What is the one other layer one you admire, you think have done a good job with their community building and their foundation? I think Ethereum has done an incredible job with community building. They led the way. Ethereum. Here we go. Another tricky one. Tomorrow morning you have to go launch a new startup. You have the choice of these following co-founders. Hmm. Jack Ma, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, or Taylor Swift. I''ll tell you which one is the best. Who do you pick? Check any of the first three. So Taylor Swift. Probably not. Not always. I was thinking one of the first three. Interesting one now. This is the final question. Question anybody comes on stage with me or goes on to my TV show. Lily, you have a chance to have lunch or dinner with one person dead or alive. Lunch or dinner with one person dead or alive. Who do you have lunch or dinner with? I don''t have lunch or dinner with Trump. What? Trump. Trump. Here we go. Guys, this is Lily Yu, the president of the Solana Foundation. Thank you very much for being with us today. We''ll pass it back to our MC. Thank you very much, everybody. To be continued... ... ... ... ... ...', 'Music Good afternoon Hong Kong.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('spotlight_on_hong_kong', 'Spotlight on Hong Kong', '未知講者', 'Keynotes & Welcomes', ' . My name is Casey Lau. You may know me from Rise, which we used to have in this same place here in Hong Kong. Thank you for that one cheer. But mostly I do Web Summit, which is a big tech conference around the world. I''m actually going to Qatar right after this for our conference there. But I''m very excited to be supporting Hong Kong. I also am the co-host of the GM Show. It''s a weekly series that I do with Meme Land, talking to founders in Web3 space. So of course they thought of me to host this panel with three builders here in Hong Kong. How many people are from Hong Kong in the audience? Okay, a few people. Great. How many people are not from Hong Kong in the audience? Okay, two. We''re going to convince you guys to move to Hong Kong at the end of this 30-minute panel. So let''s start to the gentleman on my left. What''s your name and what does your company do? So my name is Jacob and I''m the CEO and co-founder of Clearpool Finance. Okay. We are a marketplace for private credit and we''re doing this on-chain. So we are a DeFi protocol. Great. One of the, I guess, leading DeFi protocols out of Hong Kong. Out of Hong Kong. Great. And where are you from originally? Originally, I''m from Italy. Italy! But I''m in Hong Kong since nine years already. Okay. So I''m a permanent resident. Nice. I consider myself a Hong Konger. Okay. I came here nine years ago. I thought I''d come for, you know, six months or something. Yeah. And, you know, here we go. Nine years later, I''m still here. What''s your favorite restaurant? What''s your favorite restaurant? That''s a good question. Let me think. Oh, I have a lot of favorite restaurants. I think I went to the, oh my God, what''s it called? Chilli Fagara. Okay. Chilli Fagara restaurant in Central. Nice. One of my favorite restaurants. Okay, great. Sorry. I just threw you on the spot like that wasn''t a pre-planned restaurant question. And next to us, Jackie. Oh, what is your name? What do you do? I''m Jackie. I''m a local born Hong Kongers. I live in Hong Kong. I study in Hong Kong. So I just been an OG in Hong Kong as well. Yeah. And my company is called Pousa. It''s a global market making firm. So we train all the biggest exchange and we provide liquidities to the people so that they can trade with a much more low storage. Yeah, that''s it. And I''m very excited to be here. Awesome. Jackie, there''s two people here that are not from Hong Kong. Where do you think they should go while they''re in Hong Kong this week? This week? Of course, going to Consensus first. Okay. What food or what local Hong Kong thing they should do? What food? If you really want to try some local food, then I would recommend going to Namjee. Namjee. Yeah, Namjee. Very tasty. Okay. Good, good, good. All right. And Sarah, tell everybody what your name is, what your company does. Hi, everyone. I''m co-founder of Aegis Custody as well as Aegis Clearing Company, D-ACC. Digital Essay Clearing Company. Sarah is a company. I''m a co-founder of Aegis Custody as well as Aegis Clearing Company. The E-A-C-C. Digital Essay Clearing Company. Sarah and we do regular custodians in the United States, in Hong Kong and Singapore. But specifically in Hong Kong, Digital Essay Clearing Company aims to be like DTCC. Okay. Where they are public-private partnerships as well as participants from different financial institutions. Great. And where are you from originally? I was born in Taiwan. Taiwan. Okay. And how long have you been in Hong Kong? So, I got into Hong Kong through the talent program. Okay. So, I got a Hong Kong ID card. That''s great. You need that. That''s really good. Yes. And so, do you have a favorite place you like to go to in Hong Kong? I mean, Taiwan has some great food, but is there a Hong Kong thing that you love? Yeah. I normally go to Caprice. Caprice. Okay. All right. That''s fine. That''s fine. Okay. So, this panel is about shining a spotlight on these builders in Hong Kong and learning a little bit about how they started, why they''re here, and we''ll compare it to other regions in Asia. But I want to first of all start with Jackie, because he''s the OG. You started the first. So, your company is actually 10 years old. So, you were before ICOs even. Yeah. Before ICOs. Before that stuff, right? So, tell us a little bit about why did you start your business here in Hong Kong? What did it look like in 2015 compared to today? Okay. Yeah, sure. Definitely. So, my company is a global market-making firm. So, we have presence in Hong Kong. I have lots of back office and middle office here doing helping us to make us grow. So, I think like in 10 years before, right, when you talk about cryptocurrency or BTC, people will think that it''s a scam. It''s like all about money laundering. They still do. Has it changed? Yeah. Yeah. But at that time, it''s even more worse. More worse. Okay. Yeah. Money laundering, buying drugs online. Okay. Yeah. All that and stuff. Right. So, I''m trying to have a business in cryptocurrency. Oh, are you doing something illegal? Yeah. Oh, please don''t. Don''t start. Yeah. And it''s even more hard when you talk to business partners or banks. If you want to be a local business, you must have a bank account, right? Right. And it''s 10 years before, it''s very, very hard to tell them what kind of business you''re really at. Yeah. I think now it''s much better because like much more people are accepting about cryptocurrencies and all those stuff. But still, this is one of the challenging point when we are talking about having a business in Hong Kong. Yeah. Right. Are you going to bring your family to ConsenSys to take a look at this giant crowd here? It looks legitimate, right? Yeah, of course. It''s definitely legitimate now. I mean, nowadays, I mean, no one will say that Bitcoin is a scam or anything. Right. Great. Okay. Sarah, same question to you. Why did you start from Taiwan? Why did you come to Hong Kong and start building your business out of here? Yeah. So we actually started in the States. Okay. So even though I was born in Taiwan, I''ve been living in the States for over a decade. Well, I think the difference between now and maybe over six and a half years ago when we started is because we''re dealing with many financial institutions now. Yeah. So like onboarding, previously, like we onboarded like Binance US in the US. So the onboarding process of that versus now onboarding a bank is quite different. Yeah. The questionnaires that just get it added out recently, it''s just unbelievable. You''ll be addressing a lot of issues that you never imagined that you have to. So I think that''s the challenge is like even getting or even like doing clients or work. There''s just a lot more requirements in addition to the regulatory as well as in addition to compliance. Great. Okay. Awesome. Jacob, I know I''ve been to Italy and I''ve seen their tech ecosystem. So I know why you came to Hong Kong. Yeah. Just kidding. Oh, no, that''s not true. I''m not kidding. That''s true. So tell me a little bit about, so you weren''t into crypto when you landed in Hong Kong, but you eventually got into it. Why did you decide to make your business here in Hong Kong in the Web3? Yeah. So as I mentioned, I came nine years ago. I was one of the earlier guys for Food Panda for Hong Kong and Asia. So quite a change later into FinTech. And I think the main reason of making Hong Kong the hub was just that I was here. And I think the special thing about Hong Kong is Hong Kong is extremely crypto. The population is very crypto passionate, savvy or passionate. Right. You know, everyone in that, whenever there''s like a cycle, you know, whether there''s NFTs, the whole city basically speaks crypto. Right. Everywhere you go, you see buses, the whole MTRs are plastered in, you know, NFT ads, et cetera, et cetera. So it was during that time when, you know, you just get sucked up into this crypto world. You start looking at it. And then I think, you know, Hong Kong was definitely one of the best places or still one of the best places. But it was the place for crypto. Yeah. It was easy to get a little bit of a network, you know, meet important people. That''s how I met my co-founder. Yeah. You know, who was already in crypto for a longer period of time. And, you know, it just naturally progressed to have Hong Kong as my base. Yeah. So it wasn''t like a conscious decision. It was just being here and having been influenced by Hong Kong. Have you been back to Italy recently? Yeah. I''m being back. It''s great because sometimes when, you know, the market''s really bad, I go back to Italy. Nobody knows about Bitcoin, about all of those things. It''s great. FTX collapsed here. Everyone is depressed. I go back. People are like, what are you talking about? What are you talking about? What? That''s awesome. Yeah. That''s a vibe I get when I go to Europe. Exactly. Okay. So I deal mostly these days with Web 2 startups, right? And with Rise Web Summit, we do a lot of Web 2 stuff. And Hong Kong was a thriving place with many unicorns and stuff like that. Since the pandemic, kind of gone downhill. So a lot of startups are leaving because there''s no money, there''s no talent, and there''s no market here. But you guys are all building Web 3 here. So this is my question to you. We have all of these three things here, right? We have the talent, we have the market, we have capital. What are your thoughts on what''s missing from Hong Kong? Sarah, let''s start with you. Well, I think in the institutional Web 3 space, even though we have interacted over 10 banks in Hong Kong, the adoption process takes time. Yeah. And especially, you know, Hong Kong, you have the Western Bank, you have also Chinese-related bank. So like, even though Hong Kong is pushing for Web 3 for financial institutions, a lot of the Chinese banks, they were still uncertain about whether, you know, the Beijing government will support. Yeah. Okay. So I think that''s where I think it needs, I''m actually not sure whether it needs more clarity for Hong Kong or needs more clarity from Beijing. But that''s one of the reasons that some of the banks really wanted to, but they are afraid of, you know, making a big stride. One of the big things the government says here, one country, two systems. That''s a big thing. Seems like sometimes it''s good, but sometimes it''s also bad, especially for business, right? How about you, Jackie? What about you? How have you seen Hong Kong in this idea? I think when we are looking at like the crypto industry in Hong Kong, right? I think like in the old days, like Hong Kong was really a great place for crypto business. Like some of the big names are from originally from Hong Kong, right? Bitfinex, the Tenfa issuers, and then Bitmax, and then even FTX, right? Yeah. Although it''s gone, but it''s still, it''s originally from Hong Kong. Yeah, it''s still in our hearts. Don''t worry. I still have a tote bag. Oh, you still have your tote bag. I got one as well. Yeah. But anyway, but I think during the COVID was the place where the system or the government changed about how they want to do a business and how they try to shut down. So that makes, like, as you said, lots of like Web 2.0 and other builders like freeing away from Hong Kong. Yeah. But after the, now the COVID is gone, right? I think all the major infrastructure of things are still in Hong Kong. So I think if it gives them some more back time, I think Hong Kong still be a good place for like founders or builders to build their own stuff. Is there anything missing though? Do you think? I think you''ve seen the most. Ten years. That''s a long time. Yeah. I think one of the major things that can catch up is about the regulator stuff. Because like now, if you look at US after Trump coming in as the president, right? Everything goes so fast. Like even has its own Trump coin, right? Yeah. Right. So it''s so up okay on those cryptocurrencies. But in Hong Kong, it''s like the world is like moving ten step. But Hong Kong is just like moving one step. Yeah. It''s just now talking about OTC, talking about stable coins. But everything is talking about other things already. Okay. Makes sense. Makes sense. Okay. Cool. Jacob, what about you? So many great things in Hong Kong. What''s something missing maybe that you think should be? Yeah. So I think the great things in Hong Kong, I think Hong Kong has a lot of, you know, very smart traders. I guess people like Jackie and his team. So a lot of the big trading firms, you know, originated from Hong Kong. And there''s really a lot of smaller trading firms, you know, all over. Many of them are, you know, still market leading. I think on the other side, like, you know, the sort of like builder side, application builder side, Hong Kong is probably not that strong. Okay. I think even traditionally Hong Kong is not really the place for startups. There are a few but like I would say it''s a little bit less developed than some other places in the world like like the Bay Area. Hong Kong is a, you know, financial city, it''s a market city. So you have a lot of strong people there. Yeah. Maybe on the talent side, I think Hong Kong is not really known to be a place for developers. Right. You probably have a lot of good sort of like trading people for like finance guys, and less builders, less people on the on the on the on the development side. How do you think Hong Kong can encourage that more? Yeah, so I think I think right now, even as a as a government initiatives go, right, I think there''s a lot of like, very good initiatives on the sort of like institutional side. Yeah, I think for you know, and myself, we''re more like, you know, crypto native DeFi player. I think I think maybe that is one of the areas that is slightly less supported. Yeah. And I think Hong Kong can and should make a push in supporting, you know, this initiative. It''s a little bit more. Okay. Yeah, great, great. Okay. So I want to ask now, I know, Sarah, we talked before, you know, your team is very remote. Everybody''s working in different places. I live in Hong Kong. And also, I know a lot of Web2 companies, Web2 ecosystems really require capital and ecosystem. How do you feel about these things here in Hong Kong, as opposed to maybe Taiwan? Maybe Taiwan? Okay, the US like Silicon Valley, that''s like a special tier everybody wants to be a part of, right? But how do you see that these two things work together in Hong Kong? Do you feel it that that these two things are strong here, could be stronger, are pretty strong? You mean capital and talent or? Yeah, and ecosystem. Like this event here, this is the first consensus we''ve had here. But last year and the year before, we''ve had a few different kind of conferences. But this is quite a large scale international event, right? The organizers just told me 75% of people are from overseas. So it''s only a quarter of the people here are from Hong Kong or from this specific region. So everybody wants to know, does Hong Kong have the capital for startup investment and also talent and also the ecosystem like this continuously? I do think Hong Kong has exceptional talents, especially for Web3 and finance. And then there are so many people that are coming from Stradify that have already worked in digital assets for many years. I don''t think Hong Kong is a place for capital, especially for startups. I think that''s probably more for Singapore among Asian countries. Ecosystem, I would say probably yes. I mean, there are still quite a lot of companies that are from overseas as well as from Hong Kong perspective. And then I think overall, yes, compared to different regions, whether that''s US, Hong Kong, Singapore, where we all have license. Hong Kong does require the most heavy local infrastructure building. So definitely, I think the team we''re setting up, the infrastructure we''re setting up in Hong Kong is the most heaviest among all the other regions. So definitely, you''re going to see bigger teams, more operations, more infrastructure, which are also required by the regulations. Okay, interesting. Okay, Jackie, you''ve never raised any capital, but you hire people over the last 10 years. Do you find the talent good? And also, do you participate in the ecosystem? Do you host events? Do you go to events? You know, just that kind of vibe so everybody knows what''s happening in Hong Kong. Yeah, I think for like in Hong Kong, if you want to hire good developers, especially on the finance side, it''s much easier. Because like I said, Hong Kong is worse, a financial center, right? So there''s lots of talent from the traditional banks, investment banks. So that is not really the hardest part. But if you want to like, want to hire someone from DeFi. So I think this is something Hong Kong people is not originated. Yeah. So this is the hardest part. If you really want to find this kind of person, you maybe need to find another place like Taiwan or even in the Europe place. So it''s one part. The second question is? Like the ecosystem. Oh, the ecosystem. Yeah. To be fair, I think the ecosystem in Hong Kong is more around about finance as well. Yeah. So all the big names is all about exchanges. Right. Yeah. Like stable coins, those kind of stuff. But not like really builders to build the infrastructure of the blockchain. So you think there''s a lot of people talking on the top line of crypto, but not a lot of builders meeting up and sharing ideas. Like the Bay Area does that a lot, right? There''s a lot of developers, engineers talking about stuff. Okay. I agree with you on that one. How about you, Jacob? Yeah. I think, I mean, I do think there''s definitely like a good sort of, you know, there is a good ecosystem as well on the ground. I think Hong Kong, one of its unique advantages is just, I would say it''s, you know, it has less to do with, you know, regulation, all those things. I think just as a city, Hong Kong is a very good place to meet and have drinks. Yeah. Right? You just walk around, bump into people. Everyone kind of like lives in the same, like three districts. Yeah. Everyone has the office in the same, you know. I mean, you can walk like 10 minutes that way, 10 minutes that way and nearly everyone is there, right? So, you just, it''s very easy to meet up. It''s very easy to have drinks. It''s very easy to go to different offices. I was just telling to Jackie that I never made it to his office, but they''re known to have, you know, nice drinks there as well. So, definitely, I think that''s happening. We''re going there afterwards. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Nice views. So, that''s definitely happening. And I think, you know, one of Hong Kong''s unique strengths is that sort of proximity and that sort of like vibe that, you know, I think you have the same in traditional finance. Yeah. And that does foster a good ecosystem. But it definitely weakened. It definitely got less over the last couple of years. Yeah. Just because there has been a little bit of a net outflow of companies from Hong Kong to Singapore to Dubai. Yeah. And, you know, a lot of the large companies as well. A lot of exchanges. Things seem to change. Everyone''s set up. And then now it seems like everyone is slowly, slowly, like exiting again. Yeah. Okay. That''s a great segue to my next question. So, I''ve seen the same thing. Last couple of years, since the pandemic''s over, a lot of people have left Hong Kong, go to Singapore, go to Dubai. Right. We all know this is the normal story because Hong Kong''s restrictions were so tight. Right. It was very difficult to do business. So, a lot of people left. But now I see people are slowly coming back. But, you know, it''s been almost five years. If they had kids, the kids are like probably in high school now. So, it''s hard to just move people around. So, I feel like when I came to Hong Kong, I was in my early 20s. So, I came here. I believe the next generation are coming in are in their early 20s. I don''t know if this is being streamed, but if there''s people outside of Asia looking at coming to Asia. My next question will now be the big question everybody wants to know. Hong Kong versus Singapore. Right. This is the two things. So, I don''t know how many people are in Singapore. I''ve been to Singapore. When I go to Singapore, it''s like Asia-lite. Right. You go there. They got Orange Julius. They got all the famous American brands. Maybe more famous brands than we have. We got the Japanese brands here. We got the Korean brands here. Right. We got the mainland brands here. So, I see that. Right. And so, I want to know from you guys, starting with you, Sarah. What is the differences that you see between Hong Kong and Singapore for doing a startup specifically? Well, I just see an old friend from Invest Hong Kong. We were actually invited by Invest Hong Kong. They were really good at building relationships way back in the U.S., I think over five years ago. Definitely. So, we''re really appreciating them making that effort. And actually, when we first landed, they were also really helpful to help us get the world out. And even, I think, for our journey to get one activities. So, we offer digital clearing services for type one broker dealers uplifted for VA activities. It''s an over one-year process, including communicating with the regulator. And all the way, we have to communicating with the government as well. And then, Invest Hong Kong has been extremely supportive. I haven''t seen her for over a year. But, yeah. I think that''s the difference. I think we were really lucky to get the support from the government to land in Hong Kong compared to Singapore. Even though we''re also regulated in Singapore. Okay. Great. Yeah. All right. If anybody wants to know, the Invest HK booth is right there. You can go there. They''ll show you more of how to get into Hong Kong. Jackie, have you been to Singapore and looked at the market there? I''m sure you have, right? Yeah, definitely. I''ve been in Singapore to look around how the atmosphere, how the business is going. I do see that people in Singapore is more injected and then they are more like crypto friendly at the point. So, I think if we''re compared to Hong Kong and Singapore, I think it''s the old question about how the regulators look at like cryptocurrency and stuff. I think for Singapore, it must be more willing to accept them. And if we''re talking about Singapore, of course, we talked about Dubai, right? Dubai is like giving the 0% tax for crypto company, right? So, if you''re going to start a new company, a new crypto company, and you don''t have a place chosen in mind already, then the first thing you''re going to think is always Dubai, but it''s like 0% tax. And it''s, yeah, a very big advantage on that. But does Dubai have an ecosystem as good as like Singapore and Hong Kong? That''s, I think it''s very important. I think currently, if I compare now, I think Hong Kong and Singapore must be better. But you see that like things are going very fast in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, right? The biggest exchange are all selling the headquarters there. So, you will see that things will migrate quickly if like Hong Kong is not doing anything to stop it. So, the money part is important, right? Because I feel like 0% tax will not always be there. One day, it will show up again like in some other countries that have already popped back in. So, people have to decide, do they really get value out of that country than they would if they just stayed in a country that had tax, but has an ecosystem and everything already there, right? Okay, how about you, Jacob? You''ve been to Singapore. Probably have a lot of friends in Singapore, but you stayed in Hong Kong. What do you see as the two pros and cons of the two? Yeah, I mean, I love Singapore. I love Singaporean food. I''m just a little bit more of a Hong Kong guy and I''ve been here for longer. I love that. That''s so funny. I guess. That''s the main reason. I think in general, definitely, we can''t close our eyes and we have to admit that, you know, Singapore now has the bigger conferences. They have, you know, a lot of the big VCs, you know, they might have even moved their headquarter to Singapore or they decide to set up in Singapore. We lost a few big crypto companies to Singapore from Hong Kong. Yes, we definitely did. There was, you know, obviously also crypto uncertainty, you know, a few years back, etc. That also cost a few people to, you know, move to Singapore. So, overall, you know, there''s definitely at this stage, I think in terms of access of capital, Hong Kong has a lot of, you know, their family offices and there''s a lot of money in Hong Kong. I think people are generally, you know, very eager to invest into crypto from, you know, normal people on the street. Too eager. Too eager we''ve seen. So, Singapore is in a way also similar, but they just have like a lot more of the sort of international investors right now. I think the big shift right now is Dubai, right? Dubai is even more regulatory friendly. Like a lot of the exchanges obviously setting up in Dubai. But it''s also a great place for, you know, builders set up. So, a lot of the, you know, I would say slightly smaller, more innovative company startups, they might go to Dubai. Yeah. Just because, you know, it is set up to be more friendly for, I would say, high growth companies. Okay. Early stage companies, startups. Right. So, I think we are definitely losing out a little bit on that. They don''t have that, you know, talent pool in finance, etc. But as Jackie mentioned, people are quite, people move quite quickly, right? So, there''s definitely a little bit of a shift. Interesting. Towards Dubai. Yeah. Yeah. Sarah wants to jump back in. So, I have also other things to share about Hong Kong, which I think is the most amazing things even compared to the world. Okay. Like the women in Hong Kong are super strong and powerful. Okay. And so willing to support other women as well. Right. So, I mean, I just had breakfast with Evelyn, Citibank CEO. Like, she was so willing to meet up with us. And then before she went to the airport. But, and then also champion us, like within Citibank as well as like in the whole ecosystem. But not just her. Yeah. There was so many other like really amazing women in Hong Kong that are so supportive. And then they''re really like helping for the business. Yeah. And then also champion. So, I think we were having chat with a friend from the U.S. Like in the U.S., like a woman helping woman are considered to be a really risky thing. Like women don''t do that. You know? And then, but here in Hong Kong, no. Like I think, I think Hong Kong women must have done something right. They also must have done something right to educate the men in Hong Kong. It''s just amazing place. I think that there''s a lot of women in the audience. I think that, a little bit of a round of applause. If we were in the U.S., there''d be a huge like cheer for that. Yeah. That''s great, Sarah. But I think that makes a whole difference. And then like all the banks. Especially in this industry, right? In this industry, like SFC CEO is a woman. Like all the major banks, bank CEO, whether Citibank, Sancho Bank, they''re all women. And then so they are so willing to support women in business. So I think that''s a really good thing about Hong Kong. That''s great. I just walked past, on the way here, I walked past another panel. They asked the same question, Hong Kong and Singapore. The last guy said, Hong Kong for sure. And they''re like, why? Because there''s so many gamblers here. So I thought that was quite funny. So that''s a great, great thing. Okay. We have time for one quick last question. I think one of the things that we have to touch upon is what is your China play, right? This is going to be the big thing. Or do you have a U.S. play? I think that Hong Kong, as it is like seen as the connector to China. And we know there''s a lot of, you know, question marks about crypto market in China. But maybe, Jackie, let''s talk about do you have a China play? Is that important to you? Is that a benefit to doing your startup in Hong Kong? I think for China, it''s really about regulators stuff, right? Because like they banned the crypto three or four years before. And so all the builders or all the talents in crypto has like moved out from China. So I think really for the China play, I think it''s really we need to wait for the regulators to like start to like be more supportive to the crypto before we can really do anything. And for the U.S., I think we definitely see a lot of opportunities coming out. Opportunities. Yeah, because like every day they''re going to have like new things. Like one of them is like adding bitcoins as the reserve in the government, right? So this should be a huge way if it really happens. And then I think much more opportunities like things around that concept will rise afterwards. Interesting. I think that''s a good point. The Americans are doing a lot of stuff, which I think might influence China as well along the way. We''ll see. Sarah, what do you think? China play, U.S. play? Well, so we''re doing some work with Bank of China. It hasn''t announced. But I think if like a major bank in China, represent China, will be able to do something like all the other Chinese banks would follow. So I think that''s something to be seen. It hasn''t really announced. But I think that''s one. They will have to always get approval from the headquarter. So that will signal whether the activities that the Hong Kong government has been promoting in Hong Kong really get recognitions, you know, also by China. But representing by banks in Hong Kong. And not just one bank, but multiple banks in China. And then I think I saw I think some of the posting from the government official. I think right now to get maybe the PR or some investments. They are now recognizing your assets to include digital currency. I don''t think they can invest in digital currency yet. But like for your consider to be how much networks you can consider the Bitcoin. So I think I think that''s also one of the things where you kind of seeing. And then they''re catering to people with Chinese citizens. Right. So they kind of like officially kind of recognize that as well. So. So, yeah. So I think China Chinese companies Hong Kongese company are definitely huge for what DACC like digital is a clean company that we''re currently working with. Yeah. And we definitely wanted to get the largest one to come in and support. I mean, as the signal for the market. But yes. So it''s huge. I don''t think you can have a Hong Kong Web3 ecosystem without Chinese financial institutions. So and then we work with the largest asset manager called E-Fund as well for tokenized money market fund. So definitely like Chinese institutions where we collaborate the most. And I think and that''s where you would see more and more recognition of, OK, in Hong Kong, like you say, one country, two systems. Yeah. Yeah. OK. Yeah. So you will be able to see, OK, Chinese financial institutions in Hong Kong, they are able to meet the regulations in Hong Kong. They were able to do activities regularly and compliantly meeting with Hong Kong jurisdictions. So I think that''s definitely something we''re working on. OK. Jacob, quickly to you. China play, U.S. play. Yeah. I think I echo Jackie for the China play. We''ve got to wait for regulation. I think a lot of the Chinese, which have been leading figures in this space, they moved abroad. And then there''s a lot of institutions which are, I guess, led by Chinese, but they''re like abroad. And they definitely greatly contribute to the ecosystem. I think for the U.S., it''s very interesting. I was just in New York last week at the OnDo Summit. OK. It was one of the major sort of like RWA tokenization summits. And I have to say that the energy was very, very good, very amazing. Big contrast to the market. Everyone seems very excited. Everyone seems like now is the time that things might really change. Right. So far for DeFi, everyone has been avoiding the U.S. Yeah. Right. And now we shall see. Right. I think the hopes are very high. We shall see whether, you know, something actually happens. Yeah. But overall, I think everyone right now is looking at the U.S. And obviously the U.S. is the largest, greatest market in the world. So everyone has to have a China play. Sorry, a U.S. play at this point. And then getting prepared for that. Yeah. Great. Excellent. Thank you very much to our panel.', '.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('stablecoins__shaping_the_future_of_payments', 'Stablecoins_ Shaping the Future of Payments', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Thanks for joining us everyone. My name is Sean. I''m from Topos Technology, specialized in providing token payment solutions for different payment scenarios. Today I''m very excited to have a group of knowledgeable leaders who have been working with various business to navigate token payment solutions for years. Before I dive into their insights and the experience, I want to invite them for a brief self-insertion. You want to start first, Wei? Yeah, sure. Hey everybody, my name is Wei Zhou. I''m currently the CEO for CoinsPH. Coins were the largest licensed exchange and wallet in the Philippines with about 18 plus million registered users. We process about 30 to 40 million dollars of trading a day and then a bulk of that recently has been in stable coins. So in addition, being a cryptocurrency exchange, we''re also the second largest EMI in the Philippines. So we process a lot of traditional payment as well. So I''m very happy to be on this panel to discuss the use of stable coins. Hi everyone, this is Joy. I''m from ATEXA, which is a Singapore-based cross-border company. We are doing the cross-border and our stable coins trading in Southeast Asia and also in Africa. So we majorly focus on the emerging countries, trading and we''re helping them to do all the payment infrastructures. It''s very honored to be here to share with everyone. Good afternoon everyone, my name is Jason. I''m the head of commercial at StraitsX. StraitsX. We are a 10-year-old fintech that has started our journey in payments and now we have also the issuer of the world''s fourth largest non-US dollar stable coin called the XSGD and also one of the first companies in the world to receive a license by a central bank to issue stable coins. So I''m very happy to be here and looking forward to this conversation. Okay, so speaking of stable coins, Singapore government released a stable coins framework in late 2023 while the US senators recently proposed a Genius Act which is specially framework to regulate stable coins payments. So I think the regulators are now building the frameworks to regulate the stable coins but I want to understand from our business leaders, leaders, in your perspective will stable coins become the mainstream payment method or some other stable coins or some other tokens will take the lead? Yeah, so I guess yes because we are doing this yeah and we are helping to build everything yeah. I think it''s very nice combination of three of us because we have issuer, we have exchange and I''m kind of infrastructure building yeah. So we ATX so we are trying to focus on emerging countries like Africa and Southeast Asia because lots of financial infrastructure there is not that mature so we are trying to helping them to use the stable coins and the stable coins we are helping them to include in the liquidity and the fund flows for helping them to do all the distributions and the fund receiving pay in pay in payout on RAM, off RAM, off RAM, I think it''s quite meaningful because we are helping lots of people to receive their currencies since it''s very volatile yeah. How stable coins will help I say for coins PH since the exchange? Yeah so just a little bit quick side note I think so in addition to running an exchange we also got approval last year from the central bank in the Philippines to issue a peso backed stable coin called the PHPC so we are still in a sandbox environment I think we are waiting for the approval to get out of the sandbox. I think for us what we are seeing sort of like what we see sort of the last 10 years is the growth of like you know in the Philippines at least what we call digital money right which is basically we see a lot of EMIs coming in basically building basically payments helping to connect basically merchants connecting banks and then connecting individuals right. But the problem with that layer is that it''s still sort of insulated within the Philippines per se right. Like you can''t it doesn''t really talk to merchants and talk to individuals and talk to people outside the Philippines and I think stable coins the bridge that''s going to make that happen. But I think like just big picture wise I think it''s stable coins is going to be what I call it the financial settlement layer for the internet in the future. Right. So I think all payments will be used be done through stable coins just because it''s faster it''s efficient and it''s other than transaction fees on chain you don''t really have to pay any other fees. Like for example right now if I''m transferring people money in the Philippines through used to pay you know I pay almost have to pay up to is that like 10 pesos or you know that''s that''s a lot that''s like 20 cents. It''s a lot of money right. Right. So if we can basically get that to be lowered and then make it instant you know why not. So I just see sort of the even for domestic payment which we''ve seen solutions coming in right we''ve seen domestic payment champions across different countries and regions. I think even that infrastructure is going to get replaced by stable coins. Yeah maybe to just add on to what you know Wei mentioned the the genius act is a overarching theme that the US has started the ball rolling. But if you look at this part of Asia and Hong Kong where we are right now and also in Singapore there''s always been a very forward-looking mindset that has been going towards the world of stable coins because the whole idea of stable coins is it needs to be stable. If it''s unstable it shouldn''t be called stable coins right. So in a very large way I think the regulatory element that comes in is just as important as the banking infrastructure that comes in to support the whole ecosystem. So you have the stable coin issuers you have the banking support infrastructure and you also have the government level of initiative to push this tree to create the holy trinity to ensure that stable coins have a forward-looking future in the world of payments. So I think in that sense it is a very important concept as we also see in Hong Kong the three sandbox applicants all of them have their own unique use cases. But at the same time will there be a corresponding support that comes in from the banking sector. We will see about that. I know Standard Chartered is in the fray with Animoca and also with HKT. But very interestingly we see parallels between Singapore and Hong Kong. There''s going to be a lot more of that. Hey, you know, what are these guys doing? Can we do the same? And I think the governments play a very important and critical role to ensuring that this kicks off to a very good start. Yeah. Thanks. Okay, thanks for sharing. So stable coins is used as a basic infrastructure and we use in helping even the domestic transmittance and also there will be more structure we need to build for stable coins. But even though we see speak high about stable coins, but stable coins so far has not been widely used for everywhere for all the payments. Right. So and I see as mentioned, there''s few areas that have been now using stable coins very often. So it turned out to me some markets or some regions have a higher demand for stable coins solution compared to the other industries. So I want to learn from you in your view. Right. So what is the industry or regions or BNs models will demand higher solutions from payment tokens, stable coins solutions than the other in 2025, even the year after? That''s a forecast. Yeah, that''s a forecast. All you see in your business, right, when you go in, do you see the high demand from certain business model come to your company? Yeah, you see, yeah, there''s something probably will be more prospective in the next year or the year after or something probably we can think of, we can do more to provide more suitable solutions for the business model. Is there any type or a certain or maybe it''s not a certain type of business, right? Certain areas, certain regions, certain place in the world, they demand higher solutions for stable coins than the others. Yeah, maybe I''ll just set a certain reference for everyone to start the ball rolling, right? So I think everyone here has a Visa and MasterCard, I guess. Anyone here doesn''t have a Visa or MasterCard? Okay, no. Okay, what? No? Okay. Everyone has, right? So if I were to look at the total transaction volume that has been processed on Visa and Master in 2024, that number comes to around $22.4 trillion. So let me ask you a question, right? To give you a reference point, how much transaction value on stable coin payments transfers has happened in 2024? Would you say, A, the amount is half of where Visa and Master''s $22.4 trillion is? Or would you say it''s more? How many of you think it''s half? At least half? Half or less than half? Everyone else thinks it''s more, really? Okay, okay. Three, four. So everyone else thinks it''s more. Okay, so that''s the golden answer. So interestingly, even for myself, the amount of stable coin transfers that happened in 2024 was 7.69% more than the total amount that Visa and MasterCard has possessed. That number stands at $24.6 trillion. So to that point, you see that today''s market, the amount of stable coin transfers has already reached that level that you can refer to with MasterCard and Visa. So that''s on the macro level. Let''s come down to Singapore, where we stand, right? We issued the XSGD stable coin, the Singapore dollar stable coin in 2019. Today is the fourth largest non-US dollar stable coin in the world, right? But just in 2023, the entire year of 2023, the entire amount of XSGD that was issued and spent on merchant services was barely less than $250 million. The whole year below $250 million. In the first quarter of 2024, that amount was $500 million. In the second quarter of 2024, that was $1 billion. So you''re looking at a 6X in six months just on the $0 stable coin used in Singapore alone. So if you expand on that and you go beyond our borders, then you can imagine what kind of uptake that would be for the likes of the USDC''s of the world, the USDT''s of the world, or even the Southeast Asian stable coins that Wei was talking about in terms of the Philippines. So there''s going to be a lot more of the use cases, not just for domestic, but also for cross border. So I just want to share that as a backdrop. Yeah, yeah. It''s a huge number, yeah. So also share some very interesting stories. When we go to a small village in Nigeria, we want to buy a boat of water, the clean water. Yeah. And we want to try to pay. They give us a QR code and it''s a wallet QR code. So you can see in the emerging countries like Africa, there''s a huge interface. Like the young generations, maybe they don''t have a bank account, but they will have a wallet account. And they either use cash or the tokens. Yeah. So it''s very frequent user image there. And that large of people, maybe they don''t have the financial infrastructure, but they do already get inside the Web3 industry. Yeah. Nice. Anything you want to add? Matt, what you... Yeah. I mean, I''ll speak just generically about sort of what I say, US dollar stablecoin first. And then I''ll speak a little bit about sort of regional stablecoins. I think for the US dollar stablecoin, where you''re seeing the most adoption are people that are dollar starved. It''s basically, if you don''t have access to US dollars, then that''s where we''ve historically seen a tremendous amount of growth in US dollar stablecoins, especially for the country up north. I think for basically anybody that does not have... What we have right now is with Tether, with Circle, you basically now have... Everybody has access to what I call a US dollar checkings account through USDT. Right? And I think you don''t... You just have a phone, you have a wallet, you can pretty much get USDT or USDC. But I think the evolution of that is that, you know, in addition to a checkings account, you kind of want to have a US dollar savings account as well. So I actually think the next evolution, the biggest growth in the stablecoin industry is basically, can I get yield on the stablecoin that I have in my wallet naturally without putting it at risk, without having to lend it out? Right? Are there going to be yield bearing platforms? And I think that''s sort of... That''s what I''m seeing sort of like just on the US dollar front. That''s where the building... That''s where sort of the infrastructure is being built. You know, in terms of issuance, spread, I think there''s already enough network effect that that''s going to grow in itself. But the other areas of growth, I think in terms of, you know, what Jason''s mentioned is sort of like what I call the regional stablecoins. Right? Like for example, if you look at Asia, like in our region, we have like six different major currencies, right? You have Hong Kong dollar, SING dollar, Japanese yen, Korean won, Philippine pesos, Thai baht, Indonesian rupiah, you know, Aussie dollar. All of these are traded against US dollars, right? There''s no... There''s like, if I want to trade pesos for Hong Kong dollars or for SGD, I have to go through US dollars. Right? If I want to trade pesos to yen, I have to trade through US dollars. Right? But with the rise of sort of these individual stablecoins, there''s going to come to a point in the day where I don''t really have to go through dollars to trade pesos against SING dollars or to trade pesos against HKD. Right? If there''s an HKD and I have a PHPC and we put that in a liquidity pool on chain, that''s just basically FX. Right? That''s basically the evolution of the current FX trading. Right? It''s transparent. People can provide liquidity to it. As long as the spread there is better than the spread and the traditional FX of going SGD to US dollar to PHPC, that''s a use case. So I think, you know, and then how big is the FX trade globally? Right? Massive. How big is just sort of single currency? Right? For example, for pesos to dollars, that trades about a billion dollars a day in the traditional FX market. Right? Right now, we do 10, $20 million of pesos to US dollar stablecoins. It''s like 1%, 2% of just on the peso side. How much does trade happens between Singapore or between Hong Kong with Philippines? Right? How much that is currently settled with traditional, none of it is probably settled with stablecoins. Right? I think trade commerce, but the thing is, is you need to have this infrastructure that are being built and you need to have liquidity and you need to have better spread. Right? Once the spread sort of that takes place is better than sort of what''s there. I think that''s when the money starts flowing. So I''m like big picture wise, I think all of that''s going to take place. It''s just a matter of time. And then for us to sort of build that. Yeah. Okay. So stablecoins basically will be currently is a US dollar alternative. Right? US dollar alternative, stay down the USDC, USDT. It''s also helping on the emerging countries. On the other end, probably will be like a future FX market. Instead of doing fiat currency in FX market, we''ll have a stablecoin FX market. Right? Okay. So Topos, we provide various solutions for payments. So one of those actually remittance. So when we talk to our partners doing remittance in various countries, we do see there''s a need for that. When they transmit money from say country A to country B, it may start with US dollars. Right? So USDT and USDC. But when we come to destination countries, their local currency is not US dollar. So in current process, it''s a way like we mentioned, right? So you need to convert the USDT, USDC to the local currencies is true traditional FX. In a way actually, it''s not very efficiently, especially using blockchain technologies. Right? So there are demands about what we''re discussing with our partner. So they hope there is a local currency back the stablecoins. Let''s say Philippine pesos, like PHPC that the coins PH want to launch. Right? So if we do have this kind of PHPC on the blockchain, so we don''t need to touch the traditional FX market. We can just swap the USDC, USDT into PHPC. And then the PHPC that you won''t won back by the Philippine pesos. So we easily can go through any local Philippine service provider. They can happily convert this PHPC into pesos and then send to the destination accounts or wallets or whatever is required. So this is we see is required in the future. But at this kind of time, I think probably it takes some time to issue stablecoins for different local currencies in this region. But I do believe when this happens, this also very, very strong supplement to the limiting solutions. While we have stablecoins everywhere in the Southeast countries, will help to complete the limiting small efficiency online. So on the other side, while we''re talking with our partners to provide solutions, a part of these emerging markets and US dollar and also the limitants. There''s one more use case we''ll bring to us. Okay, imagine when we do block trading, right? So block trading usually is big ticket purchase between buyers and sellers. So in traditional way, the buyers, in order to buy the things from the seller, they need to go to the bank, they need to place a big amount of money according to the contract, right? And the bank will give the bank guarantee. So the seller will see, okay, you give me the bank guarantee. So now I am sure you can pay me after I''m shipping the equipment to you. Then they ship the equipment, then later they will go to the bank to get the money. The money will be sent to the sellers through SWIFT. So the whole process will take some time and it''s also costly. For the bank to issue a bank guarantee, it is not free, man. You will need to pay a long sum money to the bank to issue the bank guarantee. The whole process takes time, the whole process is costly. So we are doing a POC with one of our partners who is specializing in trading. So they have a system to work with their customer. So their system will track the whole contract, track the whole shipping process, and then to tell the buyer and seller about the progress of when it was shipped from here and there, and when they can collect the equipment. So we work together in a way we customize our merchant acquiring solution for them to replace the bank guarantee with a smart contract. So the buyers no longer need to go to the banks to buy the bank guarantees. Instead, they can just turn their payments into stable coins and we will lock down with a smart contract, where no one else can take the money from a smart contract. Then we will inform the seller, in fact we will inform the system, okay the money is in place. So the seller can start to do shipments. So the whole system, their system will track the shipments and then when the shipment was done, so they will give the order to a smart contract. Then the smart contract will release the payment to the seller. The whole thing will be all automated with the trading tracking system as well as our payment solution with a smart contract. And then the cost is very low. Even for the seller, when they get the stable coins, they can easily use the stable coins for other deals or they can just convert the stable coins into a fiat currency, whatever they want to use, right? They get away from the swift processing and there''s a low cost for them as well. Okay, so this is the other use case actually we learned through the partnership with our friends. Okay, so we can see there''s more ways, there''s more businesses asking for stable coins along the way. Probably it takes some time because even the regulators need to implement the regulation frameworks, right? And also for all the countries in South Asia, even in other regions to just pick it up, to build their own process, to build their own framework, it will take some time. For the markets, for the banks or even the traditional FIs to take up this framework, it also takes some time. But we do see, right, beyond the remittance we''ve been talking all along, there are all many other businesses asking for stable coins that will help them to facilitate their current processing to make them more swift, more cost efficient. Yeah, thanks for sharing with us. I hope all the audience get something interesting and the sharing is more inspiring. If you want to get more insights about stable coins, see how the payments will help our business, you can follow us. We are coming from Topaz, we''re also part of the Platon ecosystem. You can learn about more stable coins, how we use stable coins in the whole payment process from our booths as well. Okay. Yeah, Siang, maybe if I can just add on something to what you said, right? So a big thank you to also Platon for sponsoring this panel. I wanted to say that our partnership with Platon and All In Pay is also a very important part of that ecosystem where you can bring foreign exchange across borders, but the last mile delivery where off-ramping happens, where the last beneficiary receives it in fiat and can buy food, drinks, water, utility, whatever they want, is critical to the entire user experience. So I think if you unwind the clock five years ago, the entire stable coin infrastructure was still very, very clunky. Getting USDC doesn''t mean anything to you if you are in some far-flung remote part of Indonesia where you have no access to being able to spend it, right? And I think with All In Pay, the technology to provide that last mile ensuring that customers can access their funds, you know, in terms of a currency that they''re familiar with, where Straits X being a payments company has that infrastructure in the Singapore ecosystem and beyond, there''s a union collaboration between the two, right? And I just want to quickly say that for us, one of the examples we did was our partnership with Alipay Plus and also with Grab, which is, I''m sure you all know Grab, right? So where 550,000 tourists from China come to Singapore every single month. They bring their Alipay wallet and they want to go buy chicken rice or chili crab, right? And they want to pay using the Alipay wallet, right? But the tricky thing is that they''re used to scanning QR codes and I don''t know why, but our Chinese friends love to scan QR codes. It''s like a natural habit. So when they come to Singapore, they scan, scan, scan, scan, scan. And today, right now, since November 2024, Alipay users can scan any Grab merchant QR code or any PayNow QR code, which is local QR code, and pay using the Alipay app. What''s unique about this arrangement is that every single dollar that is transacted is cleared and settled using the XSGD stablecoin, which means transactions are done on-chain. And that is a very important breakthrough because not only does it allow the Alipay spender to pay in renminbi, it also allows the merchant to receive in SYNC dollars. And both parties don''t need to know anything or have a PhD in blockchain or stablecoins. So user experience is important to ensure that the end-to-end is seamless as though it is Web 2. So I think that''s one example where we have been building this with a lot of our Web 2 partners and also with the likes of future leaders with Alipay and Platon. So thank you for having us. Thanks for adding this as well. So I hear something is also very interesting in a sense. The stablecoins itself is not only infrastructure to be built for Web 3 payments, but also will help the Web 2 settlement occurring. It makes the in-between entity settlements more easy and smooth. Especially if the entities come from different regions. So these stablecoins will help the traditional infrastructure. Yeah. So we do feel like stablecoins will bring more innovations, right? Into not only the Web 3 blockchain payments, but as well as traditional payment infrastructure. I''ll just expand on that. I mean, that''s really cool what you guys have built. Now imagine that if you''re a Singapore merchant, you can actually, with that QR code, theoretically, you can start selling things into China now. Right? You can actually, if you''re a Singapore merchant, all you have to do is just put up a QR code on your platform. Right? Then anybody from China can basically purchase items from your country now. And that''s sort of like, that''s what I was thinking like for us, for PHPC. It''s like once we have PHPC enabled on our platform, then pretty much, you know, to sell into the Philippines, you don''t really need to set up a business in the Philippines. Yeah. Or if you just set up a business to pay for taxes, but you actually don''t need to open a bank account to actually sell things into that country now. That''s really borderless. Right? I mean, that''s what it boils down to, right? If you''re like, you know, like you''re an e-commerce or online retailer or whatever, you know, one of the biggest pain points is actually how do I collect payments? Right? But if I can collect payments in XGD or PHPC, and I have an on-chain, I have an exchange in my country that I can exchange that back, then I don''t really need to open a bank account in that country that I''m doing commerce in. So I think that''s the next evolution. That''s very cool. Yeah. Yeah. We''re also looking into PHPC and we hope there''s more collaboration with PHPC as well. Yep. Yeah. So currently we have using a USDT and USDC as well, XSGD, you know, merchant acquiring system. We do look forward to have a PHPC as a part of merchant acquiring solutions. Yeah. Because it''s important to have the settlement done in the local currency. So that way the merchants themselves can actually file their taxes properly. Right? Because that''s important because they do, like one of the things why, you know, like in the Philippines or in Thailand per se, they don''t like payments being done in USDT is they think that''s a way for merchants to escape paying taxes. To avoid the taxes. Yeah. But you want to be a part of the system. Right? So that''s why having the native currency settlement is interesting. Right? Because from a bot, from a seller, you just want to collect dollar stable coins. Right? And then you can provide that exchange. Yeah. So you see, the more we drill down into this, the more we realize and we find out that stable coins does help us in a lot of business in the day to day, in the cross border, in many business cases. Right? So Platon has been studying this more than five years ago and also Topos had to build the whole solution for various payment scenarios a few years back. Right? But then we think this is the future. Right? We will build that now and we feel like sometime in the future, this everything will become a norm to everyone. And happily, I think with the new government in the US, they are pushing the stable coins to be more regulated manner and will be adopted by more and more business and governments. Right? So I will say the future is now. There is now. Poor site. So people are working with you. There is201222767 2023iler Fat.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('super_dapps__vertical_integration', 'Super dApps & Vertical Integration', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Hello everyone, we''re gonna get started here. My name is Josh, I''m a co-founder and CEO at Supra. We''re gonna be talking about some new things that blockchains have never done before. So what is Supra? Supra is a vertically integrated layer one. What does that mean? It means an all-in-one blockchain. And an all-in-one blockchain will enable new capabilities for dApps and we call these superdApps. So let''s start with the problem. The problem today is that most dApps have to run through multiple different networks. If you need price feeds, you use an external network. If you need automation, an external network, on-chain randomness, crushing communication, these are different disparate networks to achieve these capabilities. Notice those dotted lines? That signifies latency. So every time your application needs to call out to a different network, you have latency, so it''s slower. This problem gets worse in the layer two, layer three world. Because now you have an execution layer, a data availability layer. You still have to rely on external services for Oracle price fees, automation, on-chain randomness, crushing communication. Along the way, you have a worse developer experience. It''s slower and there''s less security. Because this is not layer one security anymore. This is your security is of the weakest component that your application uses. And it costs more because you have to use more gas tokens. So once again, there''s higher cost for the developer because they have to manage multiple different tokens. You have broken security guarantees because it''s not the underlying layer one itself anymore. And you have more latency, which means it''s slower. For developers, it''s also a complex developer experience. You have different frameworks, different programming languages, multiple CAS tokens you have to manage. It''s very difficult for developers to get what they want done in a secure and fast application. We''re introducing a new way to build applications through vertical integration. So what is full vertical integration? It is a layer one with multi-VM support. So we are actually a move chain. And we have EVM on testnet right now. After Ethereum smart contracts are enabled on Supra, we''ll actually enable Solana virtual machine applications on Supra as well. But we''ve also, on our single layer one, have automation, decentralized if this or that, or decentralized cron jobs. I''ll be talking about that more today. This is something that other blockchains don''t offer. Crouching communication bridge, price-free oracles, on-chain randomness, single network, single stack that can do more things. So how can a single network do so many services though? And how do you keep it secure? Well, we break down the network into what we call clans. The whole system is called a tribe. And we randomize the nodes into subcommittees called clans. These clans have to be shuffled periodically in order to keep the network safe. This is part of our security protocol. And this is what allows us to have a single network, yet be able to perform so many different services all at once. Moreover, once we have formed the clans themselves, those clans can be shuffled to be doing different services. So you don''t have to have the same set of nodes doing the same thing all the time. In fact, the unpredictability of which nodes are going to be performing the next service is precisely how we have security. Now, Supra is a high-throughput, low-latency chain. In a test across 300 nodes around the world, a truly distributed test, we achieved remarkable results. We achieved 500,000 transactions per second throughput with sub-second consensus finality. So we are among the fastest chains in the world. And this has been formally verified by the Microsoft Ivy Checker. This is a test that others can replicate. Now, you might ask yourself, how could you have so much throughput? Let me kind of break it down for you. On Supra, every single node on our network can be a batch producer. So they can be creating a batch and submitting it to the network on the order of, you know, every couple hundred milliseconds. If every single node, 300 nodes are performing batches, and these batches consist of thousands of transactions, this is how we start to have really incredible throughput. Moreover, you know, earlier I mentioned these clans. These are subcommittees. The data actually only has to be disseminated to the subcommittee clan to form a data availability quorum certificate or data availability proof. So you don''t have to get the data to be disseminated to the entire network to have strong guarantees that the data is available. So in this system, we had a network of 300 nodes and five clans. These clans consisted of 60 nodes, but these nodes were globally distributed. The data is disseminated to the respective clans first. We form the data availability proof, and then we run our moonshot consensus, which is considered the fastest classical Byzantine fault-tolerant consensus algorithm. And once again, we''ve been accepted to top academic venues. This is peer reviewed, and this is something that no one else has. So when you have fast, efficient data dissemination coupled with very low latency consensus, this is how you achieve these results. Once again, Supra is moving towards a multi-VM architecture. We''re actually virtual machine agnostic. We think computers can run different programs as well as different virtual machines. A single computer can be running iOS and Windows and Linux. Why can''t we just run multiple virtual machines? Now, some of the slides I''m going to be showing you next are a little bit slightly outdated, because we have some brand new ideas in the last, frankly, week and a half, which we didn''t have a chance to update here. Nonetheless, a single platform that can run multiple virtual machines allows developers from many different ecosystems to deploy on Supra. Once again, we went to mark with move virtual machine first. EVM, Ethereum, Solidity, smart contracts are deployable on our test net right now. Once we move that to main net, we''re going to be working on Solana virtual machine, SVM, and CosmWasm. So once again, our system is, the whole thing is called the tribe, right? And the subcommittees are called clans. The different clans can be running different services simultaneously in parallel. Actually, Supra has the most compute potential of any other blockchain as a result. So one clan can be running our decentralized Oracle agreement. This is a protocol that is finalizing data on 600 to 900 milliseconds. And I''m talking about data finality. This is not data production and then later final. This is full data finality. It is our opinion that this is a limit for this type of protocol. This means that Supra will always have the fastest, most fresh data available. VRF, verifiable random function. What are these used for? These are used for, like, on-chain games, lotteries, loot boxes, even leader election. And if we use our own on-chain VRF, on-chain randomness for many things, including MEV resistance. I''ll be talking about that today. As well as shuffling the nodes from one clan to another. So VRFs are actually quite interesting because blockchains are deterministic closed loop systems. How do you get randomness into a system that is perfectly ordered, right? And we do this through novel and just great insights in terms of cryptographic security protocols. So a different clan can be executing the Move virtual machine. Another one, the EVM. Another one, the Solana virtual machine. And then the other one can be running CosmWasm. Single stack can be processing many, many different transactions simultaneously, providing multiple services in a shared security environment. So let''s talk about some of our new ideas. This is something that we think is going to be very, very important for blockchain to go mainstream. So MEV, maximally extractable value. This is something that is extracting so much value from chains like Solana and Ethereum right now. And what does this equate to? It equates to poorer, worse execution for the retail. And when you don''t have the execution that you expect, you don''t feel good about that. It''s not fair, you know? So how do we prevent this? Now, I''m not going to say we have the full solution because this is a very difficult problem. However, to our knowledge, what we''re going to be presenting today is the best mitigation strategy possible. So first of all, what is MEV? There''s toxic MEV, there''s what''s called good MEV, sure. But toxic MEV is things like front running and sandwich attacks that are kind of illustrated in this animation here, where the Byzantine transactions colluding with the node operator are adjusting the transaction ordering to benefit them. So what is our solution? As I mentioned earlier, Supra has native on-chain randomness. So when you have a block of transactions, those transactions themselves can be executed in a random function. Meaning we require the execution to be executed randomly. So you cannot predict the order in which transactions are going to be executed. Which means node operators cannot collude to position transactions to benefit them and the people and the parties they''re working with. Instead, it''s unpredictable. You don''t know which order it''s going to be. So it doesn''t matter which order the transaction in that particular block lands. Remember, Supra is a high-throughput, low-latency chain. We are routinely finalizing three blocks per second. So we''re talking about 300 millisecond finality per block. So there''s not any latency here either because the on-chain randomness is generated through our threshold signature on the block itself. The randomization of transaction execution is one of the best MEV mitigation strategies that we are aware of. And remember, we''re also not introducing any additional latency here. That''s a major important part of this because speed matters. Now, the kind of, you know, astute hacker might say, well, if you guys are just going to randomize transactions, I''m just going to spam your blockchain. So in order to have MEV mitigation, we have randomized execution coupled with localized fee markets. In this particular animation, you can see the light blue box is getting filled up really quickly. A lot of transactions are trying to hit the same state or smart contract. And at the bottom, you can see that the cost to execute upon that exponentially grows. So localized fee markets make it prohibitively expensive to spam the block. So randomized execution with localized fee markets, we believe, is the absolute best way to handle toxic MEV. And once again, this is being done with no additional latency. Now, in blockchains today, there are many forces that are extracting value from the ecosystem. You have liquidators, external parties, high frequency traders, algorithmic traders, arbitragers, external services, MEV bots that are actually extracting value for their benefit. And that results in poorer, worse execution for the end consumer. Our whole North Star and blockchain''s North Star should be execution quality. How do we get the best execution quality for the end consumer? So moving forward here, I want to introduce a couple of ideas that are brand new that can help tie the picture together. Supra is working on a network owned liquidity or network treasury. This decentralized treasury will be controlled through decentralized governance to promote ecosystem initiatives. We can be reinvesting in projects. We can provide incentives for node operators and beyond infrastructure providers. And what''s ultimately important here is that Supra is looking to make sure we build a system that is long term sustainable. So blockchains are not just computer systems and distributed networks. They''re also economic machines, right? So what we''re going to be doing, and I''ll be explaining how, we''re going to be describing means and strategies in which the system doesn''t have to rely on transaction fees and MEV. Remember, we''re trying to provide MEV protection. And yet MEV is a significant revenue source for node operators. Well, if we take that away, aren''t node operators not going to be super happy? The answer is sure, they might not be. However, we''re going to introduce a couple of new revenue streams that will provide a revenue for the treasury, for the node operators, for the dapps, and for the community. These ideas that I''m about to share are brand new, cannot be done on any other blockchain. And we actually think that this could be a significant, maybe actually highly lucrative business model. So Supra is a layer one with smart contracts, native Oracle price feeds, and automation. Now, these are not external nodes that are running the automation service. Our validators run it. The native automation is deployed on our testnet right now. And what can this enable? Well, we can do things like automated arbitrage. So at the end of every single block, we can identify any imbalances in these blocks. DeFi pools and such. And with the decentralized treasury, we can use our own network-owned liquidity to rebalance pools on a block-to-block basis. One to three times per second. Why is this important? It keeps DeFi balanced. It keeps things solvent. And we call this zero block delay execution because there is no additional latency. There is no external network that has to submit the transaction. Our validator nodes are executing the arbitrage on a block-to-block basis. This arbitrage profit or revenue will be distributed to the treasury, to node operators that are actually executing it. So this is a new revenue stream for the node operator, as well as to the DAP in which these opportunities emerge. So the DAP itself has a new revenue stream as well. So remember, our kind of north star is execution quality. And instead of relying on external forces to rebalance DeFi, we do this through our native enshrined automation service. Moreover, with the same enshrined automated network, our node operators execute this, we can do automatic, deterministic, transparent liquidations. So in DeFi, if there is a position underwater, the automation network deterministically, transparently, can trigger the automation in real time. And you know exactly why and how it was triggered. It''s deterministic. Every single node will execute this basically in real time. Once again, this is good for DeFi because it keeps things healthy and balanced. And typically for liquidations, there might be up to a 1% fee. This liquidation fee can be quite lucrative if the position was quite large. Once again, this is a new type of revenue stream that can be routed to the decentralized treasury, shared with the node operators that are executing it, as well as to the DAP in which the opportunity arose. So this once again is another revenue stream for the DAP. The DAP can furthermore redistribute the proceeds to their community. So we think that this is a new form of business model innovation that cannot be done on any other blockchain in a zero latency manner. The redistribution of liquidation fees as well as arbitrage opportunities to the decentralized treasury, to the node operators that are executing the automation, as well as to the DAP in which this opportunity emerged. It is a superior business model to MEV. And by the way, this actually might be an even bigger business model compared to MEV. So once again, the distribution of these rewards are to the DAPs themselves, to the node operators, and to the treasury. The decentralized treasury will be governance controlled that can be doing things like token buybacks, right? So if the community wants the treasury to buyback the super token, we can do this. If they want us to invest in the ecosystem, we can do this. If they want to extend block rewards, you know, we can do this. Super is a fixed supply token. So maybe in 10 years, who knows what the results will be. We''ve designed it so that they should last about 12 years. But if we don''t, at least we have a growing, constantly growing block by block. This is zero block delay execution, constantly growing treasury that may be able to support the long term initiatives and health of the supra economic ecosystem. So with enshrined automation, this is also really cool. With enshrined automation retail, just everyday traders can create on-chain strategies. So the things I talked about were system-wide automations. Auto liquidation, you take a flash loan from the treasury, fill the, you know, the position, pay back the loan. The difference is, or the liquidation fee is the revenue and the profit. That profit is redistributed to the treasury. That''s great. Auto arbitrage, same thing. These are system-wide solutions that are executed every single block. But end consumers can also create on-chain strategies. This is like on-chain bots, okay? This is not an external bot that''s triggering these strategies. These are on-chain, once again, no-latency strategies that are implemented. So, super with the smart contract platform with 500 plus data feeds that include, you know, cryptocurrency, commodities, equities. We''re gonna be adding more information such as interest rate cuts, even sentiment analysis, world events, weather, all kinds of information. You can create strategies that include, if the price of Bitcoin is this and the general sentiment, the, you know, fear and greed index is in the 30% range. Buy more Bitcoin, you know? Or trade my asset into stablecoin. You can have, like, if this, then that, else if, else if logic, like micro scripts, these micro logic that are checked every single block, two to three times a second. And when they execute, they execute only with deterministic agreement. So, what I''m excited about is that folks can, what we''re building towards is an interface where folks can talk to AI, okay? With AI assistance, say, hey, look, this is my strategy. I''m trying to do this. It can create the strategy for you, back test that strategy on the last, say, six months of data. And if you''re happy with it, deploy your strategy on-chain. And what''s nice about this is this is deterministic, automatic execution. There is no latency. There is no, it didn''t trigger. If the conditions are met, if they evaluate to be true, it will be done. And it will be done sub-second levels. So, what''s really cool about this, furthermore, is that these are continuous strategies, meaning these bots, we believe, these on-chain automation strategies, are going to consume more gas than humans. We think it''s natural for folks to want to, you know, kind of enter the high-frequency trading arena with everyday tools, meaning we''re democratizing access to very sophisticated tools by vertically integrating the stack. So, once again, I think it''s very remarkable that this is going to very likely create more gas consumption than humans. We think on-chain activity will be primarily gas, rather driven by these automation services and on-chain bots, right? And right now, this is being deployed on Super''s testnet. And it should be on mainnet within, say, less than two months. So, we''ve been working on this for a year. This is a game changer. No one else has this. The combination of layer one, fast layer one smart contracts with native Oracle price feeds, getting Oracle data on every single block, as well as automation. So, you have the ability to create these conditional logic that''s checked for a couple times per second. It''s going to enable all kinds of new use cases. And this is not just limited to trading. It could be refilling wallets. It could be a family giving their allowance to their kids. It could be subscriptions. In fact, this stack can, with stablecoins, you can basically build Stripe. You can build Stripe for really quickly. In fact, we have some folks that are working with us to do this. So, we are really excited about this idea of full vertical integration that can enable new use cases that you just cannot do elsewhere. We''re the first to do this. And in particularly, the automation service, the zero block delay, zero latency automation is, frankly, a game changer. It starts to make blockchains act like real computers. You know, we talk about world computers, yet blockchains don''t communicate with the outside world. You need oracles. We talk about world computers, but these blockchains don''t communicate with each other. You need crossing communication or bridges. Once again, we talk about world computers, but they don''t have automation. You need some external party to do that. But what if you brought it all in one in a single stack? You have shared security. You have faster execution. You have a single token, so it''s cheaper. And it''s, you know, mostly the thing I''m most excited about is it enables new types of use cases you literally cannot do elsewhere. Now, I don''t have that much time, but I do want to talk about the next major thing that Supra is bringing to market. We''ve been working on this also for about a year. These are called Supra containers. Now, what is that? It''s dedicated block space for your, on the Supra layer one. It''s as if you have a layer two or subnet or pair chain or causal zone experience, but on the layer one itself. So app chains give developers the freedom to build and set their own rules, but at the cost of fragmented liquidity and broken composability, right? So these zones or sub chains or pair chains or layer twos or layer threes, they break composability, they fracture liquidity. Now, with Supra containers, you can actually build your own composable ecosystem while sharing liquidity across the entire layer one. You can set your own rules, have your own governance, have your own gas token, set your own gas fees, but because they exist in the shared infrastructure, you actually have composabilities across these containers. So it''s like a layer two, but on the layer one itself. And to have that type of experience, you had to focus on scaling the layer one itself. I''ve been pretty vocal that Ethereum should be focusing on scaling the layer one for like two years. And I think they''re finally going to start to do it. So with Supra containers, it''s like your own ecosystem. On the layer one, you can have complete governance. You can set your own governance rule. You can create your own token economy. You can have your own token. You can decide what kind of applications are going to deploy into this container and also which containers your container can interact with. As a result, because they''re all on the same layer one, you have shared composability and shared liquidity. And also, instead of bootstrapping an entire blockchain like your Cosmos Zone or layer two or, you know, subnet, you can deploy much quicker because you utilize our own layer one validators. You don''t have to incentivize new sets of validators. So once again, containers are effectively dedicated block space for your own execution environment. So with Supra containers, you get the best of layer two''s and app chains without the drawbacks. You have the ability to have atomic composability. App chains don''t have this. You have shared liquidity. App chains don''t have this. Network setup is cheap and go to market will be very fast because you don''t have to bootstrap a hundred different node operators. You also don''t have to worry about the economics of paying them all because you''re just leveraging Supra''s infrastructure. Moreover, if you''re doing a layer two or half chain or subnet or whatever, if you want oracles, you have to integrate with Supra''s Oracle service, Chainlink, others. If you want bridge, you have to integrate with layer zero or, you know, Axelar or some others. If you want automation, you might need gelato. If you want VRF, you might need, you know, Supra. So the thing is, even if you do decide to spin up your own app chain, right, you''re still going to pay a lot of money and a lot of complexity to integrate bridge, automation, oracles, and beyond. Whereas on Supra, you get it all for free. It''s built in. Everything we offer in our existing stack, you get in your container. So what''s really key here is that you have, you know, builders want to have their own custom environment. They want to have their own token economy. You can set your any type of governance you want. You can compose with other ecosystems. You can decide, hey, maybe, for example, this is a regulated DeFi container, and this liquidity cannot touch just open DeFi. It has to be KYC AML liquidity. So you can deploy your container and say, these are the rules, and we can only integrate with other ecosystems. You have shared security of Supra''s layer one, which includes extreme throughput, fast finality. And, of course, you have the vertically integrated services, the Oracle, the automation, the crushing communication, the VRF, single stack. So I''m going to just briefly talk about what are possible on Supra''s stack that you can''t do elsewhere. We call these super dApps. Supra dApps include, you know, layer one smart contracts, but that leverage two or more of our other services, Oracle price fees, processing communication, on-chain randomness. So what makes them Supra in the first place? They''re lower latency because Supra is really fast. Robust shared security because we have a shared security protocol. It''s just a layer one. Simplified developer experience because you don''t have to rely on different frameworks and gas tokens of other ecosystems to have the functionality you''re looking for. It''s cheaper for builders because it''s only a single token and also it''s cheaper for users for the same reasons. So any dApp across any of the VMs we support, once again, we''re the third move chain right now. First move layer one that launched. And we are rolling out EVM support right now. That is on our test net. Following that is Solana virtual machine. And I just want to mention that Supra is also working on parallel execution strategies across each of the virtual machines. They''re slightly different. Nonetheless, we have very promising results. We''ll be publishing that result either this week or next week. So what kind of superpowers can these dApps get on Supra? You can''t get elsewhere. These include crossing communication, price feeds, real world data, automation, on chain randomness, fast, secure, high throughput, multi VM support, cross chain liquidity, native DeFi systems. Meaning Supra also has, you know, as I mentioned, network loan liquidity, the treasury. Now, I do want to mention that why is that important? It''s important because we think that our collective treasury can actually lend out funds at a cheaper rate than a peer to peer protocol. So we think this is going to ultimately result in a better, more efficient DeFi experience and enable new use cases. I''m a little bit short on time here, so I''m going to be careful about this. I''m just going to kind of go a little bit quickly here. But next generation perpetual DEXs utilizing our smart contracts, Oracle price feeds, and automation for the liquidation. And also, you know, Supra is rolling out our cross chain communication protocol. It''s called a supernova. We used to call it hypernova. Supernova is actually layer one to layer one communication. We skipped the bridge. It''s considered a bridge less protocol for cross chain communication. Now, this is also going out this week on testnet. So we have a lot going on. We''re pushing a lot of different protocols and innovations. Just due to the time constraints, I''m just going to kind of go through this quickly here. But I''ll tell you what. I think I''m most excited about the two major innovations we''re bringing to market right now, which is Supra Nova''s cross chain communication protocol. Layer one to layer one communication. How do we do that? We do that by just recomputing the consensus of the change we interact with. In the proof of stake world, we know who the validators are. So we can just recalculate if they''ve reached supermajority or not. Cryptograph will be secure as a result. So you skip the bridge. Layer one, Oracle price feeds, cross chain communication, and the big one, automation. No one has enshrined automation. We''re the first to do this. This will open up all kinds of use cases. This will also enable cross chain execution, cross chain strategies. You can do things, for example, on chain indexes or indices, which actually automatically rebalance with the ownership of the underlying asset across different chains. The possibilities are endless. The vertical integration of many services in a single infrastructure, it was always inevitable. We''re the first to do it. Thank you, everyone. We have to change the independence of, cross chainacamize and round that you have to put into the background today for the entire climate project in itself. We''ve reached theGE and version.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('take_control_of_your_health_with_decentralised_intelligence', 'Take Control of Your Health with Decentralised Intelligence', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' How are we? Good to see you all. I''ll tell you a little bit about how crypto and AI can have a baby to give us much better healthcare. I''m thinking of a future where you can have all your data leveraged for instant diagnostics for health. But before that, a little bit of exercise because it''s after lunch. Who here is interested in longevity? Okay. Who thinks I''m going to talk about a new token that''s going to moon it by the end of the day? Okay. And I''m assuming the rest of you are here because you think I might tell you about a supplement that''s going to change your life. I''ll tell you a little bit about that in a second. But since we''re here to talk about health, I wanted to give you a little bit of a different perspective. Clearly health applies to anybody that has a body. So normally when we talk about health, people think of physical health, maybe a medical record, something boring. Well, the World Health Organization defines health as physical, mental, social, and emotional. And if you can see it, we''ve actually put together an even better taxonomy of health. Because this is a blockchain crowd, we talk about health as your hardware and your software. So your hardware are things that we can measure in the physical domain. How you nourish your body. How you rest. How you move. Your software are things that are harder to measure but are just as important. They are how we connect with our family and our friends and our community. They are how we connect with ourselves, our mindfulness practice. They are things like our connection with our future self, our values and our purpose. And why am I telling you all this? Because health is not something that lives only in the medical system. Your health data is in your wearable. Your health data is sometimes with your family. Your health data is with your gym, with your coach, with your shrink maybe. And having a full picture of your health is the main obstacle of why we haven''t had adoption of AI and blockchain in healthcare. And just to keep you engaged a little bit more, would anybody who is brave here hazard a guess which of those six pillars, nourish, grow, reflect, connect, rest and move is the key determinant of how healthy you are going to be at 80? Is anybody feeling brave? We''ve got rest and connect. The answer is connect. Harvard has been running a study for over 50 years of human health and longevity. It''s the strength of our connections at 50 that determines our health at 80. Remember that because that''s going to be a big topic for medicine and medical science going forward. So armed with that knowledge, let me take you back to 1985, which is roughly where healthcare exists today. We''ve all heard that healthcare is siloed. It''s reactive. Your doctor really only cares about complaints and ailments. Well, the problem is deeper. So the fax was invented in 1962, 64, I think. Today, 2025, the fax is the most common method of exchanging data in healthcare. Does that sound believable to you, blockchain crowd? That''s the story today. It''s pretty incredible. We have PDFs and we have faxes. So that''s why healthcare is reactive. On top of that, healthcare data dwarfs financial data by an enormous margin. Healthcare data is growing 48% a year. That''s faster than media, faster in finance. And finance obviously has very high blockchain adoption by health standards. So in your life, you''re going to meet on average 18 doctors. And for every hospital you go to in the Western world, you''re going to have at least 16 different systems. Think of this, if you want to check the balance in your wallet, there''s 16 apps you need to consult to get there. So that''s why I''m saying we''re still in 1985. If I had to describe the story here in one sentence, health is kind of like a common chat group where everybody has their phone on airplane mode and is sending postal pigeons to each other to interact. Great problem set up for crypto. So where are we with blockchain in health? Absolutely nowhere. Health is a 21 trillion industry. In the US, it''s the biggest single share of GDP at close to 20%. I dug long and hard and I found approximately 2.2 billion of blockchain projects in healthcare in 2024. So that''s less than 0.01%. Why? Well, I talked about the data problem already. There''s absolutely no common standards in healthcare that apply to crypto. So we have things like HIPAA for consumer protection. We have HL7 for data interchange. We don''t have that in crypto, which is a great excuse for healthcare not to touch it. We''re an AI company. Why haven''t we adopted ledger technology to secure your data and allow you to easily share it with doctors and get instant diagnosis through AI agents? Well, three reasons. Number one, if I had to compare blockchain technology today with our Postgres database, which is what we use at Calibra, speed is incomparable. Distributed ledger technology is still slow. Blockchain is still clunky. That''s changing quickly, but we''re still not there. Secondly, when I speak to my peers about why we are not sort of holding hands and jumping together like we did in finance, it''s mostly because there''s very few pilots and they''re very sort of far between and nobody''s really talking about this because the perception of blockchain in healthcare is somewhat different to that in finance. So if I''m depressed enough, let me offer some hope. What''s changing? Well, what''s changing is that healthcare is consuming, becoming a consumer product. We all know that healthcare has to be personalized. I''m sure most of you have wondered, what can I do to improve my own health span and lifespan? Maybe some of you are taking supplements. Maybe some of you have bought a wearable. That is something that everybody is talking about in health and that is not going to change. The second thing is that because of wearables and novel diagnostics like full body MRIs and all sorts of other ways of acquiring a lot of data, there''s a data avalanche. If any of you, one of you owns an Oura Ring or a Garmin or something else, you''ve got a lot of sleep data that you don''t know what to do with. And that''s only going to get a lot worse. There''s about to be a data explosion. Again, speaks to blockchain, but we''re not quite there. And the last thing is because our attention windows are getting shorter, we want everything instantly, just like in crypto. Right? So nobody wants to wait two weeks for their blood tests to come back and for their doctor to interpret in a week''s time. We want everything right now today. The solution to those three problems are AI agents. But, referring back to my previous slide, AI agents need structured data to work. And we are back to the early problem of the phones that are put in airplane mode and sending postal pigeons to each other or, to use a Netflix allegory, we''re trying to stream Netflix movies over the postal network. So those three trends is what we see as the catalysts for change in healthcare, which will affect every single one of us, especially those of us who live in the Western world. I want to talk about three specific use cases that we at Calibra are working on, that will hopefully give you a little bit of an indication of the future that hasn''t quite arrived, but is more or less here in certain cases. So number one is the use of self-sovereign entity. Is there anybody here who thinks they own their health data? Right? I live and work in Singapore, one of the most advanced economies in the world, certainly the most digitized economy I''m aware of. In Singapore, we already have a form of self-sovereign identity, it''s called SingPass. It scans your face on your phone, it produces a code and you can log into any government website. If I want to move doctors in Singapore, even though it has a singular health record system, I can''t. I have to pay them to give me my records and by snail mail or myself, I have to take them to a new doctor. We don''t own our health data. That has to change because every day you walk around producing health insights that are not harnessed for your benefit. Your wearable data, your gait, your smile, your skin tone, how you''re breathing, all of that is critical if we''re going to be doing real-time health analysis on you. That goes absolutely nowhere or in a wearable. So a self-sovereign entity must be capable of handling 1 million gigabytes of data. That''s 300 million books. Because unlike finance where there''s a few data types, in health there''s many, many, and we produce something through our cellular processes every second. So a self-sovereign entity and the wallet needs to be able to handle a lot of data secure in the right hash. It needs to be instantly shareable so that the agents can have access to it. And it needs to be tamper-proof so that it doesn''t impact our insurance, doesn''t impact our life, or if you''re really living in the future, doesn''t allow somebody to build a biological weapon based on your DNA. So this self-sovereign entity already is beginning to crest a little bit as a wave. You''ve all heard of Sweatcoin. That is one version of health data being organized. But there are two more that I''d like to call out, which is Burst IQ and Medrec. Those are two initiatives that are encoding medical data in a blockchain that''s designed for health, which would be ideally allowable for sharing. So if you''re armed with a self-sovereign entity, then you can see a scenario where all the data available about you is made part of the decisions about your health, which would be a dream come true. So your doctor doesn''t have to ask you many questions. He has all the data or they have all the data available for them to be able to make recommendations and take decisions. Not where we are today, but kind of where we''re going. So that''s use case one. Use case two, and this is for those of you that are here for the token, that''s the only time we''re going to mention a token. What''s different about this token is that that token gets more valuable when you get off the couch and start moving. So unlike a monkey JPEG, we are thinking and looking into changing the incentive structures of healthcare. Now, all of us have imagined that our future self is going to get healthier, faster, more disciplined. That future doesn''t quite arrive. Why? Because in healthcare, we have an incentive problem. The cost of our bad habits is in the future. So whatever you''re going to do at the races tonight, however many drinks you''re going to have, they will impact the future. But if you want to fast, if you want to exercise, the cost of that is today. And here was a very bad at temporal thinking. As a result, we always defer doing the right things for our health. And that is why Sweatcoin isn''t as popular as it should be. That''s one reason. So when I talk about HATS or health action tokens, we''re trying to look into behavior change, but in a slightly different way. Today, you can measure your steps, you can measure your respiratory rate, you can measure your blood work, and you kind of know where you are with your health. The problem is that the inputs and the outputs are disconnected. So in China, for instance, they ran a program incentivizing people to have wearables and increase their number of steps. The next day, you could see an explosion of sales of those spinning machines that can turn a tracker so that it can accrue steps so that people can get a discount on their insurance. That''s not the way to go. The way to go is to measure the outputs. And for that, we have our second use of blockchain technology. If I can marry some sort of an input, how many steps you''re taking, how many glasses of water you''re drinking, how many minutes of deep sleep, if I can link that to some objective measure of health, which I''ll show you a little bit later, then we can validate in real time and issue a token on the basis of an outcome, not a process. It''s much, much harder to game an output than it is to game an input. So the second thing we''re working on at Calibra is creating a token that links a marker to an outcome, issuing incentives on the basis of that. That opens up the opportunity not only for reinforced learning, which is completely driven by AI, i.e., for me, maybe steps work. For you, maybe it''s deep sleep. For you, maybe it''s hydration. For you, maybe it''s a supplement. But it allows us to have many alternatives to a health action. And then we can even have a marketplace, since these are tokens, for incentivizing healthy behavior that''s linked to outcomes and not inputs. I think that''s going to be a very powerful behavior transformation tool once we get our data in order. So HATS is the second use case. The third use case I want to talk about is really, I think, where the future is headed. And that is, how do we connect this future of having AI agents, however we define them. For my purposes, I''m defining an AI agent, which is an independent protocol that can take a little bit of data about you, phenotype you as somebody with a certain number of challenges in one of your health pillars. So maybe you''re a poor sleeper. Maybe you have a metabolic issue which might result in cancer down the line. Maybe you are somebody who has a nutritional imbalance or a hormonal imbalance. Right now, your path is go to the doctor, have them look at your blood work, and come up with some sort of a solution. If you ask them, does this work, you''ll say, on average, it does. But I don''t know how many people I''ve tried it on, how many people actually did it, and of those that did it, how many actually experienced the benefit? Well, armed with the self-sovereign entity and some sort of a measurement through tokens, we can actually have AI agents tender for our health service. They can say, well, dear Ivan, for somebody who is described by these phenotypes and these markers of health, I can offer some solutions, and by the way, here''s the on-chain data of everybody that''s tried it, and how it''s worked for them. So you have a little bit of a competitive process. By the way, we already have a lot of shortage of doctors. We''re not making any more as fast as we should. So this AI agent story is a very, very interesting way of introducing controlled experiments in healthcare that are perfectly transparent and work well on the phenotype of client that we are. Because our bodies work the same way, but we need different things in different proportions and at different times. So number one, auditable recommendations. You are suggesting something, where is the evidence that this works for someone of my phenotype? That''s number one. Number two is bias reduction. Because the recommendations that we''re issuing are not based on a randomized controlled trial, which is designed for the average person that doesn''t exist, we have the ability to control for biases. This particular intervention, does it work? And if it works, does it work for a 46-year-old Bulgarian with my phenotype? That''s a bias reduction that currently is not possible in healthcare, but will be possible if blockchain and AI had a baby. And the latest, I think, thing to consider is that none of us have any idea what is around the corner for large language models or AI broadly. The pace of change is frankly disorienting even for somebody like myself who lives and breathes this. So the ability to have something that allows you to hot swap models, hot swap agents, and tender out in a secure way, hey, who can help me get to where I want to be? I want to be able to dance the Zumba or rock and roll even on my great granddaughter''s wedding. That means I have to have healthy knees at 85 and be able to lift 30 pounds overhead. That''s my problem statement. Which AI in healthcare can help me get there? Well, you can hot swap all the possible models instantly and come up with a number of conclusions. That is not as far as you think. We are prototyping this as we speak. So I think for AI agents to be possible, we need to solve the data issue, we''re working on this. And then imagine a future where instead of having to go and sit at an office, you can actually have a conversation or simply click a button and say, hey, suggest the next best action. That future is closer than you think. In conclusion, I just wanted to show you what this future might look like. And this is more or less our data model today. Number one, I''ve talked about AI. I''ve talked about blockchain. I think I''ve hit most of the buzzwords. I''m just going to mention Trump just in case so that we have all the bingo words. The idea is that healthcare will always be a human discipline and it will always require a human in the loop. None of us are ever going to be accountable to a machine. But the data processing, the data collection and the resultant process needs to be governed by a machine because humans simply can''t handle it. So if you want a personalized health span journey and you want real time suggestions of what actions to take, that can be governed by an AI agent. And until regulation changes, there needs to be a practitioner in the loop who oversees the program, validates it, and is there as an accountability partner to make sure that you actually go ahead with the interventions that they are offering. So there you have it. We need to travel from 1985 to 2025 very, very quickly in healthcare. The solution to that is first understand that you need to be sovereign with your data. It''s no longer acceptable for us to be the domain of the health system when it comes to owning the most important data set about us. Far more valuable than our crypto wallet, I would argue. Far more valuable than our crypto wallet, I would argue, is that you will be the domain of the data. Once we have that sovereignty, we will have the ability to seamlessly and easily and securely share our data, which allows for us to have a real time guidance and action for how to manage and be the CEOs of our own health. I''m sure some of you disagree with me. I would love to talk to you after this. If you want to learn more, the gift I can offer you through this QR code is if you scan it and put your email address down, we''re going to send you a personalized longevity guide, which will take you through the six pillars of health, give you some ideas of what you can do today to set yourself up to be healthier when you''re 50 and 80. And we''re going to give you practical examples and references to science with what you can do in each of the health pillars. And hopefully that''s useful.

Embrace Quantum Hopefulness.', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' My name is John Lillick. I guess most people know me as kind of like the early Ethereum guy. I spent six years at ConsenSys. I was with Polygon. I run my own venture fund. And I helped lead a project called Telos, which is primarily focused on ZK. But along the way, we''ve been doing lots of different types of research. And this is a talk that I''ve given at a few conferences over the last few months. And today I''m going to expand on it a little bit. Obviously, it''s a little bit timely because we''ve had some pretty significant news from Microsoft today. Interestingly, the last time I gave this talk, the Google Willow news came out. So each time I give these talks at conferences, there''s some big piece of news. So basically, kind of the first thing that I would like to suggest is that we need to get very serious right now about public-private key pair infrastructure, elliptic curve cryptography. And the extent to which deriving a private key from a public key is something that could be possible in the near term, perhaps much sooner than we might have thought in the past. Okay. So the easy way to think about it is, and historically, I was always one of those people that thought in order to have a quantum computer, we need like the NSA or DARPA or the US military in partnership with Google to build a big gigantic machine. And this is going to take a tremendously long time. But actually, the timeline is accelerating tremendously and I''ll get into some more detail around that. And moreover, when you look at breaking elliptic curve cryptography, as it turns out, it''s a very low hanging fruit. Okay. It''s one of the first things to go. So when you look at the current state of the quantum ecosystem, and by the way, let me just, okay, let me make sure. Okay. So when you look at the current state of the quantum ecosystem, and this is sort of stepping outside of our crypto bubble, I would suggest that what you''ll find is a very robust ecosystem. You''ve got obviously very large, well-established incumbents, the IBMs, the Microsofts, the Googles of the world. But then you also have Riverlane. You have SciQuantum. SciQuantum, by the way, is one of the most exciting companies in the world, in my opinion. A lot of people in the crypto space haven''t heard about SciQuantum, but I think they''re going to play a tremendously pivotal role as it relates to security infrastructure for our ecosystem. SciQuantum is taking a very interesting approach. They''re building much smaller devices. Okay. 1,162 qubits each. And you can network many of these devices together and produce a big enough network that can potentially break Bitcoin every 10 minutes. So one of the things I always like to say is you can look at the roadmaps, okay? And you can look at, for example, DARPA. You can look at IBM. You can look at Riverlane. You can look at Google. You can look at all of these big institutions. I think Mitsubishi as well. And definitely some of the big Japanese conglomerates as well. And you can sort of track where we are today relative to what their timelines predicted many years ago. And I think what you''ll discover is we''re actually ahead of schedule. So this was kind of an old IBM sort of roadmap, okay? In terms of when we would hit Q-Day. But one of the things that''s happened is AI improvements have driven tremendous, tremendous acceleration on the algorithmic side, okay? So when you want to try to understand quantum risk in the context of crypto, obviously there''s a hardware story. We have to build quantum computing infrastructure at the hardware level. But there''s also the algorithmic side, okay? So when you look at, for example, the Google Willow news with error correction, and I''ll talk a little bit more about that. And when you look at broadly across the board, we''re seeing tremendous innovation on the algorithmic side. Powered by AI. And that''s a real AI use case. And that''s cutting down the timeline significantly. And in my view, this is an example of that. Okay. So there''s a guy named Lutinski. In 2022, he put out a very important paper. Okay? And basically, so there''s another concept called Toffley gates. And some of these terms might be foreign at this time, but I think they''re going to become just as commonplace as hardware wallets and private keys. And, you know, those were very foreign, weird terms to us in 2012, 2011. So we''ve got these different types of implementations. And what you''ll discover if you take a look at that paper is actually, yeah, the potential to put the qubit count physically connected into a single machine has been sort of displaced by this approach of many machines, not one big one. Okay? And so he put out another paper, Lutinski in 2023, how to compute a 256 bit elliptic curve private key with only 50 million Toffley gates. And so in this scenario, and this goes back to what I mentioned before, when you look at, for example, PsyQuantum and their approach, these much smaller photonic wafer platforms, you can kind of put together 6,000 of these devices and you have enough to break Bitcoin roughly every 10 minutes. Okay? Take a look at that white paper. I got to kind of move through this stuff because I got a lot of slides, but definitely take a look through it, put it in your AI, have it summarized for you, try to understand. This is kind of the main takeaway though. Again, 6,000 modules with 1,152 qubits each is enough to break Bitcoin. Okay? And when I say Bitcoin, I mean, if you have a public key from that public key, you can derive the private key. Okay? Okay. So quantum computers have entered into mass production. I would argue that''s the case. You can go on Governor Pritzker''s, he''s the governor of Illinois. You can go on his ex account, Mayor Brandon Adams, the governor, the governor, the governor Pritzker''s the governor of Illinois, Brandon Adams, the mayor of Chicago. PsyQuantum just opened an incredibly massive facility in Illinois. They have a very large facility in Brisbane, Australia, and so on. You can also even go to job search websites and you''ll find that they are hiring people who are qualified to help scale this out. Okay? Okay. And of course, what does this mean if we have Q-Day? Well, actually, it''s going to be sort of like pretty nondescript. You might go on X on Twitter and you''ll see people posting and saying, wow, this one guy bought Bitcoin in 2011 and he hasn''t sold any of it for 15 years. What an amazing GigaChad and he''s made so much money. Actually, that could be that you wouldn''t know the difference between that and a quantum attack. Likewise, it might be that some of these companies, when they get to that certain, you know, when they get to a point where they think they can break a 256 bit elliptic curve, they might offer that as a service. So if you''re that guy in the UK who accidentally threw out his hard drive with, you know, a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin in it, you might go to one of these companies, sign a contract and say, hey, if you recover this Bitcoin for me, you can keep 60% of it. And again, you wouldn''t know any different. You wouldn''t know any different until the frequency started to increase. In other words, instead of every 10 minutes, some old Bitcoin moved, it''s happening much faster or there''s many more transactions moving at a higher frequency. So again, what does this mean? We need to kind of prepare. I think there''s a couple of ways to think about it. There''s defense, which means taking existing networks, existing assets, existing infrastructure, making it sort of resilient in the context of this new type of paradigm, if you will. I''ve talked a bit about this on Twitter in the case of Bitcoin. I think it''s like a four to seven year roadmap in the case of Ethereum. It''s a very complicated thing to do in the case of Solana and some others. It''s likely to change performance characteristics. OK, but either we prepare or we risk tremendous, tremendous financial loss. And in terms of timelines, again, I would refer you back to Latinsky. You could take a look at that. I was talking to my buddy, Lex, a former colleague of mine. He''s also VC. And I told him I''m no longer doing any deals where tokens vest after 2027. I''m just not. I don''t have a lot of confidence. Definitely going to 2028 and 2029. I think this topic will be probably one of the things people talk about the most. OK, so I''ve given you a little bit of hopefully context and maybe some of it is concerning. But I also want to give you the other side of the picture, which is thinking about what this new entirely new technology could enable. OK, what does the future look like? Why should we embrace it? And what does quantum money look like? OK, and so, of course, like with anything, when there''s a big shift, there''s tremendous opportunities. When Bitcoin came around, it really opened everybody''s eyes to the art of the possible when we have no need for trusted intermediaries to facilitate transactions. And from that, of course, we had kind of early wave of altcoins. And I remember that. I remember a cork back in I watched a YouTube video from a guy named Bill Still. And I bought some cork and I bought some other other coins, but they''re basically just forks of Bitcoin that had a little bit of functionality change. They''d have to spin up a whole new network. And then, of course, Vitalik came and generalize that with the EVM. And so you don''t have to continue to build that network effect. And we''ve had this like tremendous innovation that''s gotten us to this point. And likewise, I think the innovation to come is going to be even more interesting in the next couple few years. So one shot signatures. OK. And so this is this is really interesting because and probably a lot of crypto people have heard about T trusted execution environments. You know, and and I guess that''s been like a pretty fancy buzzword. But what we''re talking about is leveraging superposition. OK. And enabling new types of signature schemes that are currently impossible to do. OK. Instant absolute finality. I think that''s going to be a pretty, pretty well known kind of, you know, people talk about finality. Right now. And that''s something that people didn''t really talk about 10, 12, 15 years ago. But I think instant absolute finality is going to be one of the one of the big talking big, big buzzwords to come as this stuff develops. OK. One time programs, one time applications. OK. So you execute on any one input exactly once. OK. So this is the notion of quantum memories. One time one time memories. And so you could imagine a tradable financial instrument that''s like a like a like right now we sort of have these defy applications like Aave and it sits there on Ethereum and it''s constantly just rotating. Everyone can see everything. But imagine if it was just every time you use Aave for your transaction, it only happened that one time and that''s it. So again, this is classically impossible. It''s currently not possible to build a one time application. And what''s really interesting is these one time programs are provably impossible. And again, I think you''re going to take a look at something like Weisner states and it''s going to be another sort of big thing that we talk about in the future. OK. OK. Let''s keep going. So quantum key distribution, QKD. You could take a look at the slides here. But basically, we get into some pretty cool stuff here. OK. You will know if someone is trying to spoof information. OK. So when you look at this notion of quantum no cloning theorem, OK, it just makes it very, very hard. It makes it basically impossible to copy something. OK. So an eavesdropper will not have the opportunity to come in and read your message essentially. OK. So what we''re talking about is essentially what my friends at Never Local like to call this perfect cryptography. OK. Basically provable perfect cryptography. It gets into some really interesting realms that are currently not possible. Security that is significantly enhanced in what we see today. And those become sort of foundational elements for something called quantum money. OK. And the way I kind of like to talk about this is ledgerless blockchains. So imagine you sort of have an application on your phone and tokens appear in your phone. And now you have the tokens, but you don''t need to reference a blockchain in order to verify that those tokens are real. OK. So blockchains that do not need miners, validators, nodes or any form of shared state. It''s kind of like cash. Right. So when you have a $100 US bill in your pocket, you don''t need to then go on the blockchain to verify that you have that $100 in your pocket. I mean, of course, the bill may have some security measures printed on it and so on. But similarly, quantum money is a feature that potentially enables some really, really cool opportunities, including ledgerless blockchains. OK. And so this kind of goes back to what I was saying earlier in terms of understanding the risk, being able to mitigate the risk, but then also getting excited about the future potential and future opportunities. I would circle back to that kind of mitigating risk part. And this is something I''ve talked a lot about publicly and I know that others as well. I think my buddy Eric Wall is somewhere around. He and my other buddy Udi are leading the Quantum Cats effort on Bitcoin. Jameson Lopp has done a really great job of signaling this issue and surfacing it. And I think, you know, my message very clearly to the Bitcoin maximalists who simply deny that any of this is real claim that it''s all a scam. If Bitcoin doesn''t take action and by taking action, we definitely at a minimum need OpCat. You need concatenation. And then after that, you really need to change the block sizes. And there''s actually quite a bit more that you need to do. And it''s probably like a four to seven year effort, frankly speaking, in my opinion. If you don''t take action now and the same goes to every other blockchain that has, you know, a robust community and a reason to care, whether that''s Ethereum, whether that''s Solana. Ethereum has a roadmap on its kind of beam trajectory that Justin Drake has articulated very well in my opinion. But I think it''s far too slow. Okay. It''s a lengthy roadmap that I think is very comfortable in terms of the timeframe. And it doesn''t account for the pace at which everything is moving. I think everybody needs to pay attention to this now, right now, because if you don''t, not only will you have a very hard time mitigating, but you''re also going to be competing with new technologies. You''re going to be competing with quantum money. You''re going to be competing with ledgerless blockchains. Okay. It''s going to be, in my opinion, a really spectacular kind of thing to witness as this transition happens. And this is one of the things I talk about with my friends and others. I don''t think we need to get to the point where quantum computers exist and quantum attacks are happening before there''s a violent shift in the market. I think we just need to get to the point where the market realizes that this is inevitable and that at some point in the near future, somebody is going to be able to launch, successfully launch quantum attacks. Okay. In other words, elliptic curve cryptography is credibly at risk. Once we get to that point and the market believes that that''s coming in the near future, that''s when I think we''re going to see trillions, you know, $3 trillion market. I think it''s all going to be wiped out. The vast majority of it is going to be gone. Nobody''s going to hold any tokens if they feel as though waking up tomorrow, your public key, you know, or your private key, you know, could be, could be exposed. Even though you have everything safely secured in cold storage. Okay. So that''s why I think it''s very important. And that''s one of the reasons why I''ve been kind of thinking about this stuff. Not only have I been investing in it through my fund, but the project I''m very focused on, Telos, we''ve been thinking about this well in advance. Device independent cryptography is another really interesting kind of characteristic in terms of the future of all of this stuff. So, you know, it''s, I like to say, unreasonably secure. Okay. Device independent cryptography, it is secure even if the attacker has no control, has control of your hardware. Right. And so we''ve seen like, and by the way, Ledger, Trezor, these companies, I give them a lot of credit. They''ve done a great job. But, you know, at the same time, we''ve seen sort of issues in the past. And some of those are related to the hardware. A lot of that is kind of how the user uses the hardware and so on. But this is a new type of way of thinking about crypto hardware. Okay. Device independent cryptography. Securing your ledgerless tokens. And, you know, really when you think about it also, and you think about like Ledger and Trezor and these great companies, you know, there''s others too like Grid Plus and others. There''s already many millions of hardware devices out there. None of them will be applicable for this stuff. I mean, the ledgers don''t have enough memory to run the bigger signatures and so on. So what we''re going to need is a massive reset and like many, many, many millions of hardware devices sort of like either upgraded and or entirely new models shipped out into the market. So this goes back to what I was saying before in terms of trying to understand the scope and scale of what the migration looks like. Okay. So, yeah. So basically embracing opportunity. Entirely new cryptography. Okay. New standards. NIST just released a whole bunch of quantum cryptography standards a few months ago. You could take a look online. And we have a new race, right? We have all sorts of discussions around this topic for the first time really in a kind of credible way. And every time some news comes out, this becomes a bigger and bigger issue. The meta around this is growing. And, yeah, we can kind of either wait to be broken or we can lead the transition to security. And I think that, yeah, again, and I don''t mean to harp on too much about Bitcoin maximalists, but I do think they have a tremendous amount of influence. And I''ve had lots of fights with Bitcoin maximalists over the years. And I know how much they can stifle progress. At the same time, I give them a lot of credit because they maintain a type of orthodoxy and they don''t fall for so many. They don''t fall for scams so easily. But the reality is this kind of like culture that''s emerging right now of like this stuff is all a scam and it''s all a grift and we don''t have to worry about any of it. I think it''s like very, very harmful because it''s wasting a lot of time. And if we don''t prepare ahead of time, we''re going to be in big trouble. Okay. So this is kind of my main takeaway message. You know, let''s reject Doomerism. Let''s also reject the denialism. Let''s embrace the future. If you want to get in touch with me. Actually, that''s my old Twitter. You can just find me under Alilic John at Alilic John. You know, these are just some of the teams behind these efforts. And yeah, thank you very much for your time.', 'My name is John Lillick.

Hi, everyone. I''m Louis from AI Square, and I''ll be moderating this session today. I''m with the CEO of Pundi AI, the founder and CEO of Flock.io, and the CEO of Kite AI. Gentlemen, before we jump into our very hot topic today, please introduce yourselves. Alright, I''ll go first. So Pundi actually started as a payments company seven years ago. So we were in the crypto space since 2017. And since last year, 2024, we have decided to go into the AI space. So what kind of value do we bring into the AI space? We want to be the vertical whereby we democratise AI, especially in terms of data. So right now in our test net on Pundi AI, we have 950,000 data sets. So those data sets are from Kaggle, from Hugging Face. So what we want to do is to combine the AI field with the Web3 field, the decentralised Web3 field whereby people all over the world can annotate, label, and basically process the data. So I''m very happy to be here. Thank you. Thanks, Zach. My name is Scott. I''m co-founder and CTO of Kite AI. Before Kite AI, I co-founded a streaming DB company called Rising Wave. We raised 45 million for that company. And before that, I spent four years at Uber. Built Uber for internal skilled AI. So grew the team from myself to 200 full-time employees. And before that, I was a founding engineer in Salesforce and Instant Data and AI Cloud. So I spent last 15 years in building foundational data and AI platform. And I graduated from UAUC Graduate School. Kite AI is building a base layer for the AI. So we are calling ourselves like AI Salona, Purpose Build Layer 1 for AI. So what we do is that nowadays, for example, take Ethereum as an example. There are $4 billion each year to give to each million validators. But we are trying to redirect 90% of the rewards to an AI contributor. So from the supply side, we want to make sure all the rewards go to the AI contributor. From the demand side, we want to have end-to-end transparency between the data and the model. So for example, nowadays, Apple cannot use any open source model. They cannot use DeepSeq. They cannot use OpenAI. The reason is that they don''t know what''s behind the model. Even if you have a million data points, actually it''s a well audited and very safe data point. You can adjust to take only one data point to cause disastrous results. So that''s why the importance of end-to-end transparency for the mass adoption of the AI. That''s what Kite AI is built for. So we call our algorithm Proof Attributed Intelligence or Pure AI. That''s what Kite AI is for. Thanks. Thank you. Yes. Hi, Jihao San, CEO and founder of Flock. And I think on this panel, everyone is quite a long-term builder in the AI space. And me too, spent the past 10 years working as global head of AI at traditional banking industry and then started to do Flock in mid-2022, where we figured out the issues about data silo, right? Between different banks, between different hospitals, the data cannot be shared. But model can only be good when they have enough data. So that''s where drives us to this concept of federated learning and blockchain. So basically that''s upon Flock, Federal Learning Blockchain. So by federal learning, we mean that your data stays local. You don''t have to send your data to a third-party API or wherever. But we can still train a model in a collaborative way. That happens on many interesting use cases. Like in healthcare, we work with hospitals that they don''t have to have your private data sent over to any cloud or wherever. But we can still train a model to predict your diabetic level, to predict your eye, clinical or even some ultrasound pictures. And we also work in traditional industry, Web3 industry as well. Like we have collaboration, maybe soon with Kite, but already with Pandey, to work out the models that can be built together with the community. Because we don''t collect those data, right? So everyone can contribute their intelligence about some certain topic, for example, the football industry. And then, yeah, that can be then used to drive the power for age in the future. So, yeah, that''s generally what we do. Basically, a training layer for the models. Great. So today we''re going to be talking about what I consider a very important topic. Like just a couple years ago, it seemed like the metaverse was the dominant narrative in Web3. And suddenly, AI came along, especially large language models. And it completely took the spotlight. I want to understand from your point of view, why do you think that shift happened? Was the metaverse not mature enough or was the promise of AI just too irresistible? Well, I think just like all the narratives, those hype goes come and bind very quickly in this industry, right? So, yeah, like similarly, there was a trend of hype when people were talking about intent-centric. And then that only maybe hyped for a month or two and then all faded out because there was issues about AI hallucination. Many of those intent-centric agents or whatever, they just can''t really execute for the functional, practical usages. Until now, there are new wave of agents maybe coming soon. Well, I''ll call them AI Agent 2.0 where the functionality and the hallucination can be well managed. So, yeah, similarly for metaverse, it was big. And then there was some obstacles about hardware, about AI-generated content that can be really appealing to the user, whatever. But I would see, you know, the trend may come back again when, you know, now we have a new generation of large language models and a generative algorithms. Maybe there will be a new, you know, different trend of this coming back. So, just like all the trends, like it comes up and down, up and down, and then we''ll see them again and again. And then every time it will come with something new. So, I''m not surprised at all. Hello. I see. Sean? So, I don''t think this trend is similar to any other trend. So, because I live in San Francisco for the last 11 years, we call this AI super cycle. This is bigger than 200 internet. This is bigger than 20-10 smartphone. It''s bigger than SaaS. It''s bigger than blockchain. The reason is very simple. Like, think about, you know, at Uber, I supervised two AI products we built before. One is a collision detection. If I take Uber from this place to an AirPod, if there is a car collision, Uber will call me immediately. Also, call 911. How much time, you know, do you know how much money we spend on this model? Very simple model. Five million dollars, almost 18 months to rolling out. Because everything needs to build from scratch. That''s not true after a foundational model. Ever since we have a foundational model, instead of spending like, you know, three different engineers building 16 weeks, 16 months, now you only need one engineer. This engineer don''t even need to understand AI. They just need to build a pipeline, spend less than $100 and two weeks to build a prototype. So that''s why they fundamentally change the environment and what, you know, the world we live in. Think about, OpenAI was not able to code like a programmer two years ago. But nowadays, OpenAI already is ranked top 50 for the programmer. Similar thing for mathematical computation. OpenAI will surely become the best mathematical computation. You know, this gold medal winner in this case. So that''s why, since almost like a year and a half ago, Microsoft has prepared $100 billion just to invest in AI. Because this time, it''s different. This is an AI super cycle. This is actually the consensus in Silicon Valley and, you know, San Francisco. The only thing is that which company is going to win. That''s the hard part. Think about the, you know, the two-sided internet bubble. You have tons of companies. Most of them go, most of them are in bubble and going to die off. But pick the right one out of the 100,000 companies is the hardest thing for the VC. So you saw, you know, everyone saw that Trump announced this $500 billion fund. But long before this, a year and a half before this, Microsoft already dedicated $100 billion to this. Because everyone says this is a trend. And also, nowadays, model actually smarter than most people think. Think about DeepSeq. If you look at the logical deduction from DeepSeq, it actually can lead to reasoning itself. This is a test-time computing. DeepSeq just released it. But for the last year and a half, this is actually an industry pushing. Like, let AI think slow. It''s like giving you a mathematical problem. You don''t want AI to solve it in a second. You want it to think slow. Reason with itself. Write down the steps. And then that''s actually another trend. So we''re going to observe AI become smarter and smarter and solve more and more problems in this case. So that''s why we call it AI super cycle. Thank you. Zach? Yeah. I mean, I think metaverse has its uses. But I think AI is just so big. I mean, it''s going to upend everything, right? I think in our lifetime, it will be bigger than internet. So if internet were to change everything which it had, I think AI will change so many things. It might even cause certain companies to go bankrupt. Like Fortune 500 companies to be upended by even startups that really adopt AI. So in the specific case of metaverse, maybe the question should be, will AI actually revive the fate of metaverse? Can AI permeate metaverse and kind of like re-energize metaverse? I think that would be true. And one thing that I also find very interesting is that I think many companies and countries or whatever will be training their own models, right? They have a foundational model and they want to train it so that they have sovereign, they have privacy, they have control over it. So I think it will be a very interesting super cycle. Yeah. Thank you. You''ve all shared some very profound insights on what AI is about to become or has already become. Now I''m more interested to get your opinion on, since in the global consciousness right now, AI equals large language models. Do you think that for Web3, there could be other forms of AI beyond large language models that could deliver impact? Oh yeah, of course. It''s not just large language models. There are, you know, generating models like stable diffusion or even other ones that can, you know, be more multi-modal. And I think, of course, it''s definitely not just large language models. But of course, large language models itself is also evolving. And then we''ll see some of the multi-modal functionalities on the newer version. Hopefully, I don''t know, GPT-5 or something that they will have such multi-modal application or concepts. But I would say generally, we will call it a transformer family, right? So yes. So all the transformer family algorithms, either it''s in the form of a language model or in the form of a photo generation model. These will be the mainstream, I think, for driving the AI age. Yeah. So I do think there are three types of models going to pop out this year. The first is a multi-modal. This is like a vision model, audio model. Think about the creator digital double. You know, OnlyFans is actually one of the biggest creator platform. They actually want to create a digital, creator digital twins for their creator. Because if they have a creator digital twin, their revenue subscription rate can 3x. So that''s why there is a strong demand for creator digital twin for this, you know, this vision model and this video model and audio model. This is definitely one thing. Second is that we''re working with UC Berkeley and MSK. MSK is one of the biggest cancer centers in New York. And then we are building a medical foundational model. And then they use the country. They only have data from UCSF. They want to explore the data subnet on top of us to provide audited cancer detection for blood cancer detection data. They are building a foundational medical model. There is some research from Harvard University, you know, already built like foundational model. This is like cancer detection foundational model. This is like a more like a vision model. Medical model we saw is another trend. The third is that we are working with a media research, robotic research lab. I think this year will be probably be the first year or birth year of robotic. The reason is very simple. The older robotic is built up based on the perception, planning and action. Both of them are more customized models. This is like an old format. You build everything yourself. But now they actually replace planning with a foundational model. It requires a lot of work and they make it very intelligent, very, you know, handle all the age cases. And since beginning of this year, like last two months ago, everyone is exploring end to end foundational model in this case. They even replace the perceptions smaller model. So in this case, I think this year, you will have a lot of risks from robotics, like from autonomous driving. So this could be a birth year for robotics. So that''s the three direction. I think this year, you will make a difference. More than larger language model. I think there will be a lot of models in the market, multi models, foundational models, and what we want to come in as a value added in terms of the data set that it has. So how do you differentiate between one model to another? I think data actually provides a very significant differentiator for this. So we want it to be a... Pundi AI wants to be the central repo. Over a million data sets in the platform for people to pick and choose and annotate and train. So I think that will be very interesting because I strongly feel that there will be different models coming out. And even the same foundational model implemented in different ways. So data will be the differentiator. Yeah. Okay. I think that that''s really the perfect avenue to jump into the next segment of our conversation, which is around ownership. All of these AI models require vast data sets to be trained on. And how do we define ownership in the context of Web3 for these models? Who fundamentally owns the insights that are generated by the AI? Like is it the manufacturer of the AI? The data set provider? Or the end user? Or a mix of all? Yeah, I guess, Dar. This is actually exactly the thing Flock is solving. The ownership of the model, ownership of whatever that you are created on chain. Because the reason why we have blockchain join this whole federal learning concept is to have a clear audit trail of everyone''s contribution. Either you provided the data or you provided your insights about the model. That''s all logged on chain that you can see clearly. So whenever this model is being used, this is basically the way how they calculate their revenue share with our creators, right? So this reminds me of Chris Dixon''s book about Read Write On. Basically, the early age of AI industry where some platforms like Kaggle, these are the early platforms where people actually posting bounties there and then they compete with their bounty and the winner wins it and that''s it. So that''s basically the stage of read, right? And then we have hugging face, which I will call them read and write. Because you can have your model there, you can host your model there also, but then still you''re hosting your model there and that''s it. There''s no any interaction for the model, let''s say revenues in the future. So that''s the read, write stage. It''s better than the Kaggle. I mean, there''s more functionality than the Kaggle platform, but then it''s still on the read, write stage. And then I think that with the blockchain join, with companies like us, like maybe the other two, we are pushing the read and write ownership of the blockchain. So that''s the right ownership stage where you have the bounty, sorry, you have the model, you can host the model, also you own the model. So whatever that happens to your model, you''re actually getting those revenue shares about and usages. So that can serve many long-term, long-term demand. Because you can imagine Google work with a very huge department store, right? Because there''s enough demand from that side. But then for the long-term ones like a corner shop, it''s unlikely Google will work directly with them. But with decentralized AI, like us, platforms like us, everyone can have their own model, be trained and be hosted. And then they can still earn long-term with their own model. So that''s where I think we are pushing for. Thank you. So I think one of the current trending we saw is that less and less data actually available online. So ever since the open AI come out, like 50% open source data previously would say, hey, you know, describing the robotic TXT, you can cry it and use it for free. Now I''m going to take it down off the internet. Now the internet become more and more worded garden. Because the people don''t want open AI, take some data, train a most powerful model, take billions of profit and then leave them nothing here. So that''s why the total, you know, the AI economic is broken. So in this case, I think we need to solve it in two steps. The first step, each company needs to get its right share of the money, profit. Because if they don''t get a right share of profit, they have no incentive to public data. The public data share will slash by half by the end of this year, based on some research and maybe even decrease further. This is the first step. You need to have public company willing to share data because they get a fair compensation. The second step is that this data ownership needs to go to individual. That''s actually very important. At the end of the day, all the public companies, they don''t produce data auto-sign. They actually based on their consumers in this case. And then as you know, as the Jaha mentioned, I think for the first time you can, with the blockchain help, you can identify who actually owns what data. Think about this. Nowadays, when you drive the Tesla, they collect all your data, but the data don''t own by you. You know, in this case, Tesla can use your data, train the best autonomous driving model. It''s basically used you as like experiment mice, you know, in this case. Like, in this case, the reason is that there is no way to systematically track ownership of data, systematically track the profit of data. You know, where did it come from, where did it used to in this case. On the other side, the data ownership always combines with privacy because most of the people say, hey, if I can profit from my data, I''m really definitely willing to. But if I say this will violate my privacy, people will have a major concern in this case. But from raw data to transform the data to the data used for machine learning, there is actually a lot, you know, big step. So that''s, you know, what Kite AI is actually building infrastructure, data and AI infrastructure too, to make sure everyone''s data. First, we''re going to form subnet, you know, make sure subnet''s profit is given correctly. Then subnet can distribute each individual contributor, but also preserve each one''s privacy because you only get the data at aggregated level. Remove all the personal information. So that''s what Kite AI is building for. Thanks. I think that the existential question for Web3 company with AI is that how can Web3 be meaningful when it comes to AI? So like how Web3 company can create real meaning in terms of AI? I think ownership is definitely one thing. The second leads to democratising of AI. So when we talk about ownership, it is in fact a very strong trait that Web3 has that can help AI. Right? So all sorts of problems that both of you mentioned, you know, like privacy, ownership, you know, Uber taking you as a guinea pig, you know, like wherever you go, you become your data trainer. So I think ownership really can be something that Web3 company can give value to AI. So when you look at a data set, right? Who owns the data set? It actually depends who you ask, right? If you ask the researcher that contributed data, he would say that he owns the data set. If you ask a model that trains the data, he will say that the model will say that he owns the data. So to different people, to different actors, ownership carries different meaning. So we in the Web3 world is actually very familiar with ownership in terms of like using NFT, ERC 721, or even different ERCs to represent ownership of data. So I think that actually kind of like opens up an advantage for Web3 companies to do all this. And this is not data set. It''s also like the models, right? The foundational model might be owned by this ERC 721 token, which is owned by everyone here. So everyone here actually co-owns the model. But the data set can then be actually partially owned by the model and also the people that contribute to the data set. So I think when it comes to ownership, when it comes to democratizing of AI, it is what we can do on the crypto companies. And for Pundi AI, what we want to do is that we want to provide a million data sets. Right now, we are near to that. We are 950,000 data sets. But what we want to do is to make this 950,000 data set spawn to different version, which is then owned by different people. Right? So the data set of consensus, for example, today, if it''s like, you know, it could be co-owned by the audience here. So I think ownership actually is something that Web3 can give an upgraded meaning to AI companies. Yeah. Thank you. That leads me to the next question. We''re down to our last six minutes. So I just want to get an overview of what the three of you think the future looks like in terms of AI in Web3. Are we looking at the kind of future where we have AI agents, which is a trend right now, making decisions on our behalf? Or do you think there are more meaningful or powerful use cases that are going to emerge from now on? Yeah. Want to start? I can. Yeah. So, first of all, AI agents can be meaningful as well. So it''s not just the memes, right? Because, yeah, I mean, we saw the first wave of those agents, and many of them are meaning. So, yeah, I admit that. But then the ones that we''re, I think we''re all pushing is the 2.0 version of those AI agents who are actually having their own functionalities that can actually help you, for example, doing the trading. Oh, you know, the new narrative recently, something called FAI, DeFi, like we said DeFi by using AI to automate the process or help you process the trading or training or whatever. And I know Pondy is also, I don''t know, are you going to reveal this? Doing the on-chain agent that you don''t have to have a human behind to work for the agent or market making. It''s all on-chain. So, yeah, so that''s the new wave of agents that we''re all maybe hoping for or actually pushing for. So the models building on Flock currently, we function them to many of those agents. We work with agencies or companies like Anymore Brands. They just announced, hey, Any with us yesterday. Oh, sorry, two days ago, which is a VC investment agent that you can take any CA or DAG, and then they''ll give you feedback about the interest of investing into this. So the agent can just hold in the funds. And then whenever your project looks good, then they will just automatically invest. So there''s no human in the whole process. It''s like all automatic. So, yeah, many of these useful, interesting agents will be emerging and then, yeah, the models will be trend on Flock, by the way. Scott, what''s your take on this? Yeah, so I think I always ask my question, is blockchain for AI or AI for blockchain? If it''s AI for blockchain, AI can empower every single app here. The total address for market is as big as blockchain. But what kind of AI build is blockchain for AI. We want to actually empower AI to use blockchain. I''ll give you one simple example. How do you think AI agent will make payment? They cannot use credit card. They can definitely not use cash. They cannot use debit card. So that''s why wallet is the best media to actually pay payment. Because wallet is programmable. You can break the payment into a smaller one. You can, you know, authorize one, delegate token and burn it later. This is no security risk in this case. So that''s why what we build here is focus on blockchain for AI. Use blockchain to empower AI. Again, AI is $10 trillion super cycle in the next 15 years. And currently there is no way to make payment. There is a lot of things actually not being able to solve. Use AI itself. That''s what''s going on. So that''s what we build for blockchain for AI. Right. I think when you talk about agents, everyone is, everyone of us will think about AI 16Z. So I think that''s like the kindergarten preschool version of agents. What will come out this year? First half of this year is on-chain kit agent whereby people use the agent to assist a person to invest in Aave or whatever lending protocol. So I think that is definitely coming. A lot of money market protocols are building this. So we will see that. So I think that will become a good assistant in terms of how I want to invest into my extra money. So if I have a thousand dollar extra, would I want to put it into Aave? Would I want to put it into Moonwell? Or do I want to put it into Nikkei 225 through agents? So I think that is definitely coming. Everyone is building it right now. The money market platform. And I think for a longer horizon, I would say that each of us will be represented by agents. So for good or bad, our soul, we will be represented by different agents. So each of us will have several agents. And depending on when I am, right? If I''m in a Premier League football match, I would use that agent to represent me to place bets. But if I''m in a, I don''t know, family setting, that would be a different agent because that agent knows what my family members want to buy in terms of gifts. So I think agents would permeate so much that it becomes almost part of us for better or worse. So super cycle, trillion dollar, but it''s coming. Yeah. Alright. In the last 30 seconds that we have, since you''ve all shared your different perspectives, would you say that we''re looking at the future of digital twins for ourselves with those agents that do things on our behalf? For sure. You know, someone showed me a demo. You can just talk to an agent for less than two minutes and the agent can talk exactly like you. I see. This is actually a demo show today, like last week actually. So I think, you know, a simple agent represents you not only like audioly or videoly, it''s coming very soon. There is no technical difficulty. It''s just cost perspective. Like, is it worth it? You know, do you want to spend $2 to actually clone a digital twin or yourself? Video part may be longer, audio part immediately. OK. eine Thank you.', '.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('the_next_wave__public_bitcoin_treasuries', 'The Next Wave_ Public Bitcoin Treasuries', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' My name is James Van Stratton, I''m the senior analyst at Coindesk and with me is Roger Hamilton. Roger could you just tell us a bit about yourself and Genius Group please? Sure, we are a Singapore based company, Genius Group is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, American. We are the only Asia based Bitcoin treasury company that is listed on the US exchange. And we started our Bitcoin journey three months ago when we announced that we were going to be buying Bitcoin, get to our first thousand Bitcoin and we are pretty much about half way there right now. Yeah, so I have had a keen interest in the Bitcoin treasury adoption. Recently I got announced as a strategy advisor to a UK public company as well to manage their Bitcoin treasury strategy. And it is interesting that this whole trend is starting, so it is not just in the US, UK but globally. So what is your take on US adoption from a treasury balance sheet and then just from a global point of view as well? Yeah, absolutely. So probably some of the audience knows that here in Hong Kong the first Bitcoin treasury company started this week, which is 1723. They announced they were going to have one Bitcoin that they were going to buy, which they bought. So one Bitcoin under $100,000 and their market cap went up by a billion Hong Kong dollars, over 100 million. It went up another 10% today. So why is it that Bitcoin treasury companies are seeing such massive growth in comparison to Bitcoin? I think we are going to get into why that is. We saw the same. Our volumes on the New York Stock Exchange were several million a day. On the day we announced our volumes went up to over 100 million shares traded. We tripled our share price and we have seen that again and again in different cities and countries because there is such an appetite for those that understand that this is much more than just buying Bitcoin. It is about creating an entire value layer for Bitcoin, which is going to give institutional investors as well as retail investors the ability to be betting on a team as well as the Bitcoin on maximizing this new digital economy. Yeah, I completely agree. And taking my personal experience with the UK, that the UK is starved for growth. Like our equities market is on a nominal basis since 2008 up 20%. If you adjust that for the M2 money supply we are down about 60%. So in an equities perspective, investors are starved for yield and getting Bitcoin as that hyper growth asset is like kind of supercharging everything. So when Microsoft actually initially started that playbook in 2020, they did that cash defensive position because inflation just started to take off. And then their stock started, I think they are a $1 billion market cap. They are now an $80 billion market cap. And he has used multiple capital raises in the past four years. So that''s ATM share sales, so selling shares into the market, convertible bonds, preferred stock. And every single capital raise he has done, he has created new records. So the $42 billion plan in October of last year, biggest capital raise of all time. So that was $21 billion ATM, $21 billion convertible bonds. And it''s just fascinating, I guess, as a CEO, just to see that another CEO has just absolutely transformed capital markets. Right, yeah. I mean, like if someone goes out and buys a dollar of Bitcoin today, they get a dollar of Bitcoin, right? If someone goes out and buys a dollar of Genius today, they get a dollar 50 of Bitcoin. And if the markets go where the analysts say it''s going to go and Bitcoin does get to 200,000 this year, we''re making $45 million of profit. For every dollar you put in, you''re making a dollar 50 of profit this year and you still have the equity, right? And so, and we''re going through a whole series of different investment vehicles, very similar, like you said, preferred shares. What can we do in terms of ATM? Genius has $150 million ATM we had approved. And we''re looking at saying what''s the M&A activity and things we could do to really make sure we''re giving a shareholder return. Nothing is going to be Bitcoin. So actually building a Bitcoin treasury instead and then building what we believe is going to be not $200,000 Bitcoin, but we''re the same as Eric Trump and many others at $1 million plus. If it was anywhere close to what Michael Saylor is saying, $13 million per Bitcoin, you take that against our 440 Bitcoin right now and you''re talking about already a $440 million, and you take that in the millions, you''re talking about already like a $440 million at a million. If it''s at $10 million, you''re talking about a $4 billion treasury that we have accumulated in three months that we just need to sit over the next five years and build a really solid business on top of that. And we''re still basically, even without that solid business, you know, sitting on a multi-billion dollar reserve. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But it''s fascinating to see that obviously Mike''s actually implemented their playbook and then every other company has got to kind of do their own iteration, their own spin-off. So you''ve got MetaPlanet, can''t do an ATM issuance, so they''ve had to find new and novel ways to do it. The UK market, we don''t even have an options market, so we have to try and find new and novel ways to increase our Bitcoin treasury. And then you''re seeing these new KPIs come in, so Bitcoin per share. So that becomes for an investor who doesn''t want to get immediate dilution, and it''s all about accretive dilution. So any time that any investor or the company dilutes the stock, you need to make sure that the Bitcoin is outpacing that dilution. And that''s Bitcoin yield, right? Yes. So Michael Saylor came up with the idea of Bitcoin yield, which is the idea that as long as whatever you''re doing to sell more stock or expand your capital base, the actual Bitcoin per share is going up, then you''re doing the right thing, right? Yeah. Our Bitcoin per yield in Genius in Q4 was 1,700%, right? That was at the end of last year. But here''s the most interesting thing, I think. If you''re in this space, whether you''re a CEO or whether you''re an investor in one of these companies, everyone who''s in it is small enough right now today, you''ve got a total of like 160 companies, public companies around the world that actually are owning Bitcoin right now today. If you go to BitcoinTreasuries.net, you''ll see a running total of it. We all know each other. So Simon Gurevich, who runs MetaPlanet, he''s going to be in New York next week for the Bitcoin Investor Week, which Anthony Pompliano is running. We''re sponsoring that. We''re going to be there with him. A lot of our strategy was coming off the back of what Simon and I have spoken about on what his experience was at MetaPlanet. When he started his, it''s a Japanese company that was $15 million in market cap six months ago. They went from $15 million to $1.5 billion after they decided to go down this pathway. You know, if you look at the 1723, which is renamed from Hong Kong Asia Investments to Moon Inc. That''s the new name of the company. The reason it went up by $100 million in market cap here in Hong Kong wasn''t really about the one Bitcoin. That was kind of like just, you know, just a PR piece. It''s the fact that the people behind that, Sora Ventures, are the same people that are behind MetaPlanet, right? They actually said to MetaPlanet, we''ll give you cash for your hotel business if you invest in Bitcoin. They really understand that if as a public treasury, you are the gateway for institutions into exposure in Bitcoin. And they did it well in Japan. They''re now behind the same company in Hong Kong. So we''re going to see, I think, MetaPlanet starting up in Hong Kong as well. And another partner is David Bailey, who runs Bitcoin Magazine, runs the Bitcoin conferences. And again, in terms of like the ability to connect up with the right people and learn the very latest strategies, whatever you''re hearing in the public as the latest strategies, what the CEOs are talking about are like six months down the line, right? So you''re getting a view into the future of basically where the returns on Bitcoin are going to be or where companies are building value on top of Bitcoin. And I believe the same as what Michael Saylor says is, frankly, in the long run, there''s only one thing that can outperform Bitcoin, which is Bitcoin with a value layer, which is a Bitcoin treasury company that has access to funds to do more than simply own the Bitcoin, but to grow the digital economy on top of it as well. Yeah, it was interesting you say that because on my announcement, our share price went up 40 percent and we had five million shares traded on that day. And Coincilium, they''ve IPO''d in 2015. So they were actually the first, essentially the first Bitcoin treasury company. And it was the most shares traded since they''ve IPO''d pretty much. And it shows that if you have the essentially, I don''t know, the right team or the right strategy and you can execute it, it can be really profitable. But being in this space since 2017, I''ve never seen sustained demand like we''ve seen before. Right. So I did just a bit of research prior. And since the halving, which was on April 20th, 2024, the stat was there''s been 137,700 Bitcoin that have been mined. And then if you include all the public treasuries that have acquired Bitcoin, so Mike Strachey, you guys, the miners, ETFs. And then you can then on on-chain analysis, you can look at short term and long term holders who are defined by anyone that''s held Bitcoin for 155 days. That''s actually totaled 449,491 Bitcoin. So that''s over three times the mine supply. Right. So where we''re getting Bitcoin at this $90,000, $100,000, and it won''t correct more than 20% really this cycle, there is a sustained demand that''s been bidding just below. So they''re not really waiting for, they''re not chasing the price, they''re waiting for the price to come below. And it''s price action that I have never seen before. Yeah. And the total, like you''ve got 21 million Bitcoin. You know, we use the example, same one that Michael Saylor talks quite a lot about in terms of Manhattan. You know, back in the 1700s, if you had land in Manhattan, think how much that would grow by. Manhattan actually is like 21 million square meters, right? So very similar to 21 million Bitcoin. There''s only so much of it. And now over 3 million, about 15% of all Bitcoin is owned by these treasuries of which the, you know, like the sovereign funds are still just starting. But between the ETFs and the Bitcoin treasury companies, we''re just talking about the stats there. You know, you''re talking about like about, you know, a million on, or million point four on an ETF side, about six, 700,000 on the, on the treasury side. My prediction is we, by the end of this year, we''re going to go from that 3 million to at least 6 million, at least doubling. The Bitcoin treasury companies will become more than the ETFs because the actual flows in have been on the ETFs. But you only get $1 Bitcoin for $1 of an ETF versus right now what''s happening with the multiplier effect of a Bitcoin treasury company. So I think that as more and more innovation happens, as we''re seeing, we''re, we''re an education company. So we have an education layer on top of Bitcoin. We are launching our Bitcoin treasury. We''re sponsoring this stage. We, we have our booth over there as well. The first people who are in our Bitcoin academy is Safedino Mouss who wrote the Bitcoin standard. Yeah. And of course he says, look, people read the book, they, but where can they learn about this? So we''re bringing his courseware onto our platform. We have Anthony Pompliano, Natalie Brunel, the top podcasters with all of their interviews also becoming these programs. The Bitcoin week, investor week next week, we have Cynthia Loomis who''s there, who''s like driving forward 20 plus states and the US government itself on Bitcoin treasury. You know, we have Vivek Ramaswamy, we have the likes of like Kathy Woods from, from ARK and all of the CEOs, similar meta planet, you know, all being there as well. We''re taking all the best pieces of that and turning it into our courseware as well. And so of course, everyone who''s interested in Bitcoin and Bitcoin treasuries, they''re learning from us. We''re making profit and revenues from that. And then we''re then using that to then build more Bitcoin, right? And, and buy more Bitcoin. And so every different company has their own value layer. And I think you have yours as well with your UK company. I think it''s really interesting to see how people are going to be making much more of a distinction on how they buy into Bitcoin. You want to buy direct and just custody it yourself? Or do you want to buy with someone who knows how to multiply the value of that Bitcoin through this digital economy? Yeah. The, the most interesting thing is the, Mike Strachey or the other public companies, all the Bitcoin they have is unencumbered. So there is no liquidation price. That''s the most important thing. They have full optionality on their Bitcoin, meaning the strategy that will evolve. It''s a bit like a land grab. You grab as much of it as you can. And then you look at, all right, how can I increase my revenue, my, which will turn into yield. I know that''s a very dangerous word in this space, but if you can find that on a risk adjusted basis in dollar terms or in denominated in Bitcoin, that becomes a really, really powerful tool. So I think that will kind of be the next iteration once we get Bitcoin at a very, very serious valuation. I think you''ll be able to dictate terms and start to lend out in very high multiples. Yeah. Well, here''s the interesting thing as well. Whenever you have massive high growth from early adoption, there''s a risk involved, right? Like if you were to invest in the top 10 AI companies today, knowing that in a couple of years, maybe eight out of the 10 will fail compared to the two that succeed. And there''ll be other movers in as well. You''re risking quite a bit if you''re trying to invest in all of them by which ones might fail. If you have the top 10 Bitcoin treasury companies today in the next couple of years, if some don''t do a good job of that Bitcoin, the Bitcoin doesn''t disappear, right? Those companies will end up merging with the more successful companies, which means the risk to you of actually losing out is much, much less. Plus at the same time, you get the multiple. So if last year, MetaPlanet goes up 1700%, MicroStrategy goes up 600%. This year, how many hundred percent does it need to go up for you to say it makes more sense to buy in Bitcoin now? Like last week, for example, we had a day where our share price close to doubled, right? And again, this is happening in terms of the volatility of what can go up and down in terms of the ability to be actually participating and also learning from the very best entrepreneurial minds that are in these Bitcoin treasury companies right now. Perfect. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.', 'My name is James Van Stratton, I''m the senior analyst at Coindesk and with me is Roger Hamilton.

So if you just want to go ahead, give a quick background about yourselves and then I''ll go. Professor? Yeah, my name is Xiaoli. I''m currently an assistant professor at UHK. I''m working on cryptography and some blockchain technology, related technologies like zero knowledge or succinct arguments. Yeah. Hey everyone. My name is Rodney Shen and I''m a third year computer science student at the University of Carlton in Ottawa and I''m also the founder of the blockchain club at my school. And for those of you who don''t know me, my name is Isabelle Key. I''m a final year student at Boston University and I run operations at the Blockchain Acceleration Foundation, which I''ve been doing now for about a year and a half. So with that, I think we''ll just go ahead and dive right in. I think we all know how competitive and cutthroat this industry can be. But where we''ve really seen innovation and these new creations really come about, especially things like Starknet, Ethereum, which we all know. Ethereum started by Vitalik. Vitalik is a Waterloo alum. So I think my question to you guys is, despite an ever-changing competitive environment, how have you guys worked to kind of prioritize the main focus here of just getting people on-chain? Yeah, I think, first of all, I would say blockchain clubs, they naturally thrive on collaboration because they are a place where people can get together and share ideas and it really create a healthy space for this collaboration. On the other hand, of course, the Web3 industry is very competitive, but I think the collaboration and competition can co-exist. I think the club just focuses more on the community aspect to hosting events like a hackathon, a workshop or discussion group to create the collaborative space. In my university of CUHK, I think this is further supported by design of courses or programs. For example, we are one of the earliest institutes worldwide to offer courses like blockchain and both from the applied theoretical side. To be honest, currently, according to my knowledge, we have six different courses for both the undergraduate and post-graduates. And two of them are coming from the business school for financial technology industry department. And four of them are from the computer science or electronic management. The engineering school ones are more focusing on the technology level things. And the financial department thing are more focused on the business model. They are trying to build business leaders, but with some technical insights so that they can serve the community better, like to bridge the different needs from the technical experts and the business leaders or investors. Yeah, I think this kind of program design really, really helps to bridge the theory and practice and also from the technology and the business aspects. Yeah. Yeah, I think that''s really cool. I think you guys have like six more Blox-Toying courses than we do. We have zero, so that was a joke. Yeah, when it talks about balancing competition and collaboration in the space, I think in my experience so far, a lot of it has just been, you know, we''re building up together, right? There''s not really this sense of competition and cutthroatness because simply because, right, in Canada, we have like 436 post-secondary institutions, but we only have about six university clubs, right? So it doesn''t really make sense for us to start, you know, fighting each other and fighting over sponsorships when there''s the Web3 community is so broad and diverse. And, you know, that''s really true when you just, you know, just go on Twitter, right? And you talk to, you just DM people on Twitter and ask if you want to like collab with them, and they''re more likely not to say yes, right? That''s one of our main methods of outreach we''ve done so far at our club. And another thing to add, right, I think it''s really funny because we have such little clubs, right? Everyone is, everyone''s like talks to each other, right? All the heads of, all the presidents of the blockchain clubs in Canada, we''re in group chats, you know, we''re all like university students. We send memes to each other and we talk about how we can help each other out. So I think it''s a, it''s a really new industry and I think it''s, it''s really cool because it just sounds like just hanging out with your friends and you''re building communities. So yeah, yeah, of course. I think that''s the best thing about like just the web through industry as a whole is it''s a very collectivist kind of movement. I think the goal of it basically is like we all accelerate together. And then I think with that, you know, as we all know, like one year in web three is like a generation past in web two and traditional finance. So with that, I think based on your observations of how long you guys have both been in the space, how has the sentiment kind of changed over time, you know, through bear through bull, um, through the different like regulatory, you know, impositions and sanctions that have been imposed throughout by various governments, as well as, you know, the rise of like meme coins and like all these different other kind of, you know, different sects of web three. So I think how has like the environment in your opinion shifted, be it whether it''s from a technical standpoint, a legal standpoint or just a general financial standpoint. Do you want to start first or yeah, I think that''s a really interesting question. I think, um, because our club''s so new, right? We haven''t been through so many cycles. So this is our first, you know, really fortunate we''re starting off in a bowl, which is, you know, really cool. Um, and when it talks about perception of students of what three, you know, I think they have a general basic knowledge before coming in, like, you know, what Bitcoin is, they''ve heard of that before. Um, but when it comes to new, more nuanced things, uh, more so like, you know, like ZK, uh, it''s probably a bit less. Um, but I think that''s something we''re trying to build on. Um, and I think, I suppose now I''ll say two things, right? So with meme coins, I think that''s a really good onboarding method, honestly, because I think it''s easy for everyone to understand, right? It''s something funny. Um, uh, but also the fact that I''d say, uh, of how fast the industry moves, right? Like you said, uh, year in, uh, but three is a generation in the normal world, right? And I think from where we are in Ottawa, right? I''m talking about our situation. Um, in Ottawa, I''m not sure if you guys know, right? There''s a lot of bureaucracy. It''s big governments, you know, and, uh, big telecom companies. So not the most innovative, not the best innovation. Um, I think it''s a breath of fresh air for students in Carleton. When we have, uh, an industry that''s moves at this fast of a pace, I think it''s something, uh, it''s a breath of fresh air for them. And I think this is a big reason why we get, um, so many students at our clubs, right? Because I think students do want to be entrepreneurial and do want to, uh, build cool things. And I think what three can be a means of, uh, doing so. Yeah, definitely. Especially the chance to be like first at something or like, you know, one of like, you know, the Genesis kind of generation of like the space. I think that really, you know, incentivizes students to want to participate and get involved. And then professor. Yeah, my experience is like very similar to Roni. Uh, I think it''s a combination of three, uh, reasons. The financial aspect, the, uh, uh, uh, and also the, uh, a financial aspect. And, uh, maybe let me just start with the financial one first. I think, uh, uh, according to my experience, like this, this generation of students really, really, really know that, uh, Web3 is a thriving industry. And, uh, they see that this as a place they can especially establish their career. And, uh, this is, uh, how aware actions are and they want to be a part of it. Uh, this, this industry already create, already show great potential to create, uh, many job opportunities, which is one of the most, uh, concerns of the undergraduate students. Yeah. Um, that''s like one concern. The other one is like a more like a cultural, uh, in a sense that, uh, um, you know, the ideas behind the, uh, concrete technologies of, uh, Web3 or blockchain is just incredibly, uh, like conceptually or intellectually appealing. Uh, I, I, I can tell this from, uh, my, uh, teaching experience. Like, uh, for example, when I, when I talk about some concepts or technical concepts, like for example, uh, uh, succinct and, uh, and succinct argument of knowledge. So this idea was initially rooted from, uh, uh, some theorem called PCP theorem, which is a very theoretical computer science thing. And, uh, uh, when, when I explain this connection to them, uh, they just hooked. They, they think, oh, this is fascinating in that, uh, you can turn a, uh, purely mathematical object and turn it into some, uh, uh, something in our real world. Like to, to provide the privacy and consistency in our real world. This just like, this is a purely like intellectually appealing. So this incurs their curiosity. I can see that after this topic, if you''re more motivated to investigate this topic further. Yeah. I think this is like one of also one of the men, men, uh, like motivations. The, the, the finally, I think the ethical, uh, concerns also plays a role in the sense that, uh, you know, uh, uh, web three promise to, uh, provide a more, uh, equal or privacy or decentralized internet environment. And, uh, this, this concept like it resonates with the young people nowadays a lot. And, uh, yeah, it''s just, uh, attract them like to this industry and they want to contribute their own share to make the internet a better place. I guess. Yeah. It''s just a combination of the three, three, uh, reasons. It''s all about building the open web. And then with that professor, I just had one more follow up to that as could you talk a little bit about a certain project that you''ve seen kind of go from like the academic space, like from the university ecosystem that''s, you know, been built out and like, is now like a fully fledged main protocol or projects. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, uh, the, the one, one example comes to my mind or the project called, uh, Z cash. I think most of you have already heard of it. It was a, like a, uh, project started in the academia and, uh, it was turned into a successful, like, uh, industrial example. So this Z cash is basically it''s a privacy focused, uh, a blockchain idea. You, you want to add on top of the, uh, blockchain, a traditional blockchain and prep protect the privacy further by using technologies like a zero knowledge proof. And, uh, these ideas were originated from, uh, uh, theoretical cryptographers in the academia, uh, specifically, I think, uh, Ellie Ben Sasson and professor, professor, professor, Alessandro Chiesa when he was at a UC Berkeley. And then, uh, it was nice to see that, uh, they successfully turned this into, uh, like, uh, a startup. And I think that their, their chains are running success, running like, uh, successively nowadays. And, uh, but, but of course this transition is not easy. Uh, I, I can see that sometimes we want to turn a academic project to, uh, like real world stuff. You have a lot of concerns. Like, first of all, you need to care about it. Like you have financial concerns. You need to think about how to hear engineering, how to respondings. And, uh, yeah, a lot of administrative staff are marketing and things. Also, you, you, you, sometimes you, you face questions from the regulators. So, like, I think this is the place that we are, uh, organizations like a BAF can play a big role or make a big difference. Because they can help, uh, like bridge the researchers and, and the financial people, like, uh, for example, e-masters and also, also the, uh, uh, legal experts, lawyers to help addressing this kind of, uh, issue to make the transition more smooth. Yeah. One of the best mottos right now is bridging the gap between academia and the real industry. And that''s something that we''ve been really, really successful with, you know, bringing students from all over the globe to different conferences like consensus, ETH, Denver, token, et cetera, as well as kind of, you know, supporting students in their, like, just overall building process. A lot of our students, you know, now are very successful. They''ve ended up at companies like Hedera. Some have gone on to work with us. Some have gone on to be at Coinbase or go for masters and PhDs. And throughout that entire thing, BAF has supported them through, be it academic, post-grad advising, grants and stipends to come to different conferences around the world, or even just kind of like giving them a space to really showcase their ideas. And that''s something that, you know, us as an organization has been really proud about. We believe in like a collectivist kind of, you know, mindset of just, I think it''s when one of us succeed, all of us generally tend to succeed. So that''s how we''ve really like approached working with students, academics and researchers from like all over the world. And then one final question for you, Rodney, is what have you personally done in your ecosystem to kind of keep the spirit of the open web going? Yeah. I think two main things, right? So for our events at our club, we have, one of them is like we have guest speakers, right? So we have guest speakers from the industry. So this is Sarah Founders. These are C-suite execs, big exchanges that come in and talk to our students and give insights, very nuanced insights about the field, right? Not stuff they can usually find on the web. Because I think this gives them a perspective about what Web3 really is coming from someone that has, you know, power in this field. And to transition that onto what we do is also like workshops, right? You know, I have a technical background. Most of our club is devs. We want to actually start learning and running workshops and learning together of how to actually, you know, leverage this technology, right? And they work hand in hand because, you know, they get inspired from, you know, hearing startup founders and talk about their successes to learning about, you know, have a reason to learn. And as well as when they do have this, you know, background and knowledge about the Web3, they''re going to be a lot more, it''s going to be a lot easier for them to understand the very nuanced topics that they talk about, right? So yeah, that''s... And I mean, you never know who the next Vitalik will be, so. But thank you to you both. I really appreciate your time.', 'I''m glad that both of you could be here today with me.

in the good fight against crypto crime so let''s start here uh with you give us a quick intro who you are what you''re doing and how you''re going to fight crypto crime great to meet you run uh yeah thanks for having me here at consensus i''m anthony i''m one of the co-founders of artemis uh we''re a crypto data provider that we''re trying to bring truth to crypto um so uh organizations like visa paypal standard charter use us uh to understand what people are actually doing on crypto what apps are they using uh where are they from um and what types of payments are they''re doing and so you know i think crypto is still unfortunately you know full of sketchy stuff and we hope to bring light and truth to crypto and and promote crypto to be the you know the future of finance excellent go ahead yeah yeah i''m testing oh it works uh my name is arnold i''m ceo co-founder of sphere uh we developed sphere pay uh which is the fastest on and off ramp in the world uh to my knowledge um and we do that using stable coins uh and lower level bank messaging optimization so effectively explicitly defining uh the way that the money flows through banks uh which as i''m sure we''ll discuss ends up being quite the headache um simultaneously we''re developing sphere net uh which is a private svm cluster uh that automatically runs things like transaction monitoring risk scoring uh some pretty cool uh tie-ins with zero knowledge proofs uh for regulated fintechs who might not know as much about blockchain uh but really see the use cases of stable coins and want an easy way to get started um and yeah mostly active in ladam uh apac the u.s uh and mostly support v2b fintechs uh pleasure to meet you all okay cool so chris who are you my name is chris jian chesky i''m the head of global investigations at trm labs we''re a blockchain analytics company i''ve been here for about two and a half years prior to that i was a special agent in irs crew investigation in the united states and uh happy to be here thanks for having me okay and uh leo right there hi everyone i''m really happy to be a part of this panel uh particularly with such um great panelists here with me uh my name is leonardo real leo it''s easier though and i''m heather''s chief compliance officer a role i''ve had since 2018 i''m in charge of the regulated activity including anti-money laundering uh but tether is a really unique company in that unlike most uh let''s say vasps we''re not singularly concerned with um the activity of our customers uh we''re also concerned with the secondary market which has hundreds of millions of users uh so it''s a very interesting role very cool and now we have justin''s son from tron we all know him so justin i heard that the t3 group which is tether tron trm which is looking to fight crypto crime it was your idea so what''s the story there yes um so first of all i think the uh combat elixir activity on the blockchain is not easy right it''s uh require uh data analysis require um real time like monitoring um it''s also requires like uh report you know i need to find the right person here um i''m really grateful you know um with the work of um tether you know kiam at labs and the tron uh we can all um bring together uh and the show to the regulators and the law enforcement in the world actually we have the professional team uh on those uh uh uh tasks and we make sure uh those tasks uh get down um and and also um i think um for example like uh not like everyone you know in crypto has this kind of the tech force you know focus on this kind of the specific task uh our um task group is um is permanent right so we have the full-time employee um postage updates um update uh uh every quarter and we have tasks uh basically collaborate with the law enforcement uh like every day uh i think by the time pass you know we will see uh more and more job get down uh and and and uh global wise i think the legal authorities uh will believe you know crypto is uh wow the best way to chase the back actor uh um and be transparent right about like all the things happen on the blockchain we can prove to everybody what happened so that''s i think the uh wow the best thing happened uh in the crypto okay very cool so chris you are ex-fbi and ex-irr irsci and you know you have fought crime for your whole career how is crypto different in crime fighting because i''m sure there are similar elements across all kinds of crime but like how is crypto unique in this regards yeah great question so uh when i went to the academy one of the things they hammer home to you as an irs special agent is following the money if you can follow the money you can find out who''s conducting the illicit activity behind it and certainly there''s no truer place for that to happen than with crypto particularly with the public blockchain and so having that skill set is really useful because it applies to so many different types of threat landscapes whether that''s sanctions evasion terrorist financing child exploitation if you can if you can follow the money you can figure that out and um this t3 has really been a probably one of the most exciting opportunities we''ve had at tm in the past couple years that i''ve been here one because just seen how quickly law enforcement has gravitated towards it we''ve been successful on five different continents multiple different jurisdictions i''m sure we''ll talk about frozen over 131 million dollars and it''s been a broad swath of crimes too from money launderers again like terrorist financing narcotics trafficking and scams um and i think ultimately just being able to have a public blockchain allows people like us that may not have access to information like we don''t have to go to the bank to get their records to see what happened to somebody''s account you can access them the public blockchain and so a lot of the cases that we''ve teed up have also been proactive we''ve gone to places like chain abuse and sourced victim reports and be able to confirm their allegations on a public blockchain and trying to do a lot of the work as much as we can for law enforcement around the world okay cool because you know with evidence you have certain standards to use right like a screenshot of etherscan just won''t cut it so how does tear on labs produce evidence to be used in investigations and prosecution uh well one of the things i think i''m most proud about of our global investigations team has a lot of former law enforcement like myself so not only would i say that they''re probably some of the best crypto tracers in the world but they also understand just investigations in general they understand the context the context behind the transactions and like the human who''s ultimately conducting those transactions so how does that fit in how can law enforcement use this string of transactions to then be able to articulate probable cause to be able to get a search warrant so using like their historical experiences uh using the context of what''s happening uh with the transactions online but then also that whatever information we can also find with it maybe we can make some connections to twitter to someone''s like uh vanity username maybe there''s some forum somewhere somewhere where somebody had some type of connection and like really having this whole puzzle that you''re able to build out uh particularly from an online public persona uh is i think really critical can get um an investigation a lot of where it needs to go but then ultimately law enforcement can use their authorities and the information they have to take it even steps further okay interesting now for tether why is it important to be part of this you know why is it important that you guys work with tron and trm labs in this effort so it''s important because trm labs is and sorry tron is is the blockchain that''s most used uh by the world uh in terms of usdt usage of course tether already had an external investigations team prior to trm where we were already working with global law enforcement uh but i think it''s really important that where we can uh leverage the the network of some of our trusted partners it just makes sense to be able to do that and so uh tron has a great network trm obviously has a great set of investigators with amazing skill sets and to be able to work with them um in a very fast way is a big game changer for tether uh the name of the game when it comes to blockchain investigations is speed uh if you aren''t fast enough to uh get information to the right authorities uh and to tether to freeze uh very quickly then you might have a situation where uh funds are dissipated to another blockchain that maybe isn''t feasible or uh through some serve mixing service uh where you might lose sight of the uh of the funds and so um having such great partners who understand the game who understand investigations who are very diligent and want to work quickly is super important and we''re very happy to be a part of this uh partnership cool so from tether''s point of view like what does it look like when you guys work with tron and trm labs in freezing funds like walk us through the step by step how it works um so in in terms of step by step we have a global investigations team on our side uh we have uh an investigations team where we''ve sourced people from former law enforcement agencies uh prosecutors offices uh investigators in banking as well as uh blockchain forensics experts and so we have a team that really understands uh the blockchain and they''ve been working already on their own with law law enforcement like i said uh previously uh but but basically um tron and trm are uh engaged constantly with law enforcement worldwide they have a fantastic network of uh law enforcement they''re conducting their own uh and osint investigations and almost kind of tee up uh potential investigations that are in line with uh the sorts of crime typologies that uh tether is interested in uh looking at and uh and that we collaborate with each other in order to stop uh we we''ve come to know how to work with each other we understand the uh risk tolerance that the companies have and uh we''re basically uh uh forwarded different cases uh that we assess and assess at the same time that law enforcement is looking at this and wherever possible uh we quickly organize the appropriate key signers on our side to uh freeze funds as quickly as possible okay cool and then continue to work with law enforcement throughout the case very nice all right so for the t3 group is there like a case you''re most proud of like which bust do you think was your most important one in the last year chris how about you chris do you want to take that one yeah sure um i think we highlighted one most recently with spain which i think was pretty impactful that in itself was about 27 million that was frozen and i think what was really kind of unique about that one is they gave us a heads up that they had an operation coming um certainly didn''t give us all the details of the operation but pertaining to the side of crypto they knew that they wanted to freeze these funds and uh as many people in law enforcement know that like once you go knock on a door anything can happen and that can include those funds being dispersed all over the world change to different assets and so timing was pretty critical we had about two days or so to get everything um analyzed to have everything ready to go and have it to uh meeting the risk standards for tether to be able to go and then there was a hard deadline things wheels were in motion to have it go and i think that one was probably the most impressive because if we weren''t able to work together from the public side to the private side and the partners within t3 to have that queued up uh that money might have been in the wind and they weren''t going to hold back the on the ground operations that they had because uh we couldn''t get our uh ducks in a row and thankfully we were able to wow it''s like that show 24 right it''s all about being urgent it''s being quick you know yeah it''s exactly like that nobody ever eats it just cuts and then you just go on to the next one okay very nice um so for arnold so you guys work a lot with the real world use cases of blockchain and crypto like payments and that kind of stuff and payroll so how do stable coins help with that you know why can''t i just run payroll through like ach or something you know how do stable coins help and also like what are the challenges uh involved in this yeah uh so stable coins are super useful because they''re a proxy for a dollar account uh dollar accounts are typically permissioned by american banks uh and with a stable coin you basically get a permissionless uh up to you to lose it uh dollar account no matter where you are in the world um if you don''t speak english you know all of your documentation is not in english uh kind of makes sense that it''s hard to get a dollar account from an american bank and as a result it''s been pretty incredible sort of the coinciding of threads between people getting access to dollar accounts and also coming online for the first time uh you know we''re pretty active in lat am costa rica hit internet majority penetration about a decade later than the united states and the general adoption of like e-commerce fintech because internet companies need to make money has led to some pretty surprising use cases invoice factoring being an example you know because you now have a dollar account someone can take risk uh and advancing your payment uh and you know generating yield on the back end i''ve met an amazing brazilian company actually here who does that works with like the coca colas of the world um i think the other really interesting one is internal uh inventory management yeah so if you''re familiar with like airwall x or wise or some of these more traditional payments companies stripe they typically have to use swift to send money to their own bank accounts they hold like pools liquidity scattered throughout the world uh and that''s how you get money locally stable coins make that 10 000 x faster but i think the challenge really comes back to swift and part of where we''ve been able to see latency improvements is that if you''re outside of the country where the issuer is or where the market maker is it still takes forever it still takes two three five ten days to get in and out of stable coins which kind of like defeats the point of being able to send a stable coin so being able to do that same day uh a moniker we like to use is there is no like costa rica or sorry there is no silicon valley of costa rica means that capital efficiency is super important latency risk because you know if you hold cop overnight colombian peso you could lose 10 of your balance sheet makes tackling some of those less obvious frictions with swift even with stables that much more important okay now what about then for artemis right you guys are in blockchain intelligence you know and all these use cases have intelligence part to it right like there is challenges and threats but you guys are working to like you know help the concerns of trad fi and of stakeholders in making sure blockchain is clean yeah and so from what we''re seeing i think um you know i think there are two angles one is that everybody even though you know stable coins don''t go up in value uh traditional finance uh has been asking us uh like day in day out um like how much stable coins are in the system is it going up like is there more supply and the reason being that uh stable coins are liquidity and lifeblood of any any network and so ultimately these traditional finance investors care about buying a token like swana or ethereum is it going to go up and so if there''s more clean state uh stable coin supply on these networks uh that are powering real use cases naturally these networks value will go up and so again even though you can''t invest in stable coins stable coins are very very important uh to the sort of yeah the the livelihood and health of a of a network for sure and you''re also ex-trad fi is that correct so one of your trad fi colleagues talking about stable coins is on their radar or is it still something they are going to ignore or what uh they definitely cannot ignore it so i would say we started artemis about three years ago um and i think the only people are talking about stable coins are sort of dex traders who are trying to you know bring liquidity into into crypto but um fast forward to 24 everybody so you know i used to work at paypal i was there for six years uh they are knocking down on our door be like hey we need stable coin data right now we are literally we cannot we do not understand what''s going on and we want to know because we want to get into the action and so i would say yeah 2024 was the year of stable coins and i think 2025 will be also continue to be this year of stable coins but then paypal won''t get involved if they think that stable coins facilitate you know drugs and crime and that kind of stuff yes exactly so that the question they ask us is hey what are people doing with stable coins and so there''s this kind of strange chicken and egg problem here where it''s like the you know these public companies in the us won''t go into stable coins unless they know what''s going on and they know it''s clean but then there''s no real good data on like what the uh what the clean usages are and so that''s where kind of artemis comes in where we highlight a lot of these like use cases like what you know what arno just was talking about with severe pay i can name like 10 other companies that are doing something uh they''re really interesting you know not just trading um and you know it''s just like these companies aren''t being highlighted what being highlighted is trump launching a meme coin and it''s kind of unfortunate it''s also kind of annoying that you know the meme coins in some ways get the attention when things like payments and payroll and the so-called boring stuff of crypto of sorry trad five rather is on crypto now but not getting the headlines yes exactly um i i actually got a really interesting anecdote yesterday from a large asset manager uh they were like hey the you know i asked them what what''s holding back crypto and he was like honestly the wall street journal and financial times all these folks just need to cover the real use cases of crypto because all they cover are like trump stuff and so it''s just gonna you know incite fear into the you know the public mainstream mindset but as they say if it bleeds it leads right in media so yeah so justin um tron right now has 62 billion in stable coins on the network how do we get to 75 or 100 billion what''s the next step yes um so first of all i i think thanks to uh the tether um power right so we have seen uh one or two billion of usdt increase on tron network uh every month i think the majority of them contribute to the um users action actually uh tron uh um 62 uh billion dollars reserve it''s just uh one number i think i have been like more focused on actually we have around 20 to 30 billion dollars uh worth of the transaction volume happen on the network every day i think this is more important and approved to everybody um tether has been used like very actively uh among you the users in the group uh because for ethereum for example uh even ethereum has the equivalent amount of the tether on ethereum but the problem for those ethereum uh the transsector volume is only 10 billion dollars it''s only uh probably 30 percent of the uh tron volume so that''s why i think our um as a network operator uh our mission is to collaborate with tether uh to make sure the users uh use this stable coin um in the way they want and to guarantee cheap uh faster uh instant transaction uh and they basically can make transaction anytime they want they can deliver the cash uh to uh to uh to the destination um so uh so that''s why i think also while the secret recipe of like tron network uh how it got you know so big you know successful um i think we will continue to do that uh we want to deliver this to um to the customer and also uh um with the you know service quality provided by tether uh we want this to be uh uh you know uh available infrastructure for people globally yeah and then we can''t get to that point if it''s not a clean network if politicians around the world think that stable coins equal drugs and bad actors we gotta keep this clean yeah yes definitely so uh we want like politician law enforcement trust this network too right so i i don''t want to give them like an impression once you know any fund goes to crypto it''s like goes to um um basically a dart hole or anything right it''s it''s impossible to trace anymore you know uh the bad actor is just get away with it right with the funds you know it''s gone so uh we we want to deliver uh this message to to the regulators it''s like crypto is the same space it''s just like serves the users better right it''s a cheap fast instant transaction but that that it does not mean you know it''s a black hole you know once the funds going there it''s gone you know we''re gonna find like everything we can um by uh uh establishing a very professional team you know making uh phone tracing report you know focus on that uh as chris you know just mentioned you know even a few days you know uh ahead of notice is enough you know we will do whatever we can to help law enforcement to get get back the money yeah for sure um so going over the sphere how do you guys work with trm to make sure that your payroll and your fund flow is clean yeah so you know compliance on chain companies like trm uh basically label cluster various wallets so that way you can check wallets the transactions that are associated with them and basically build like a heat map of like where you know suspicious activity occurring and so naturally we would run that through all the transactions that we facilitate uh supplementing of course uh more traditional i''ll call it aml vendors on the bank side it''s that combination that really makes it rock solid because you get it on chain you get it from the sending bank you get it from the receiving bank so three layers of you know sanity checks to make sure that there''s nothing wrong going on um i think the future uh though will be uh this like weird uh maybe marriage between traditional and on-chain compliance where right now like run times on chains don''t really differentiate uh between transaction or account types uh in the same way that they would on a traditional fintech ledger um and you know hopefully this allows us uh not to make it a meme but say ai agents come on and make some of that manual work uh and compliance escalation easier uh you combine that with the work that''s being done on zero knowledge proofs and you can start to bake some of these uh controls uh that you would normally pay like a unit 21 on the fiat side for you can bring that data on chain and make it easier for companies like trm uh to really monitor the whole end-to-end picture uh not just like what''s coming from exchanges or maybe being bridged uh but you know coming from the fiat world uh and going to it interesting okay so for chris for trm like what''s unique about sphere and the challenges you might see in payroll and stuff like that for fraud like is that provide a very unique and different way to look at fraud versus just like transactions permittances is there something there yeah i think so like in crypto investigations it''s very important to find these kind of cash out these on-ramps off-ramps of where crypto connects to the real world so you can follow you know a bitcoin transaction all these circles uh but at the end of the day somebody usually wants to use those funds to pay for something right and so having a company that''s you know facilitating payroll and other ways to distribute funds like you want to make sure that those are legitimate off-ramps you want to make sure those aren''t ghost employees you want to make sure there isn''t some types of sanctions invasion going on uh certainly my colleagues back at the iras would make a statement about tax evasion as well and so you know there are many different um specific i''ll say threats to be able to focus on so like this just mentioned um there''s the traditional fiat side of it and looking like who are these people are legitimate but then also from the payment side where are the funds coming from where are they going i think it''s you know kind of unique and crypto sometimes hold themselves to a higher standard even like if you think of a bank and somebody deposits cash and says here like to put this in my account where''d you get it from like my grandma gave it for me well like the conversation is kind of over right like you''re going to follow the cash backwards and like look at security footage all the street cameras for the past years like no but in the crypto world you can take those hops backwards and see like oh you said you got this on thursday but really the transaction that''s funniness uh occurred like four years ago and it''s from a dark net market or something like that and so there are many more um opportunities in crypto to be able to kind of uh make sure that those transactions are safer yeah it''s funny actually you can be a cop and work from home with crypto you''re not out in the field not doing surveillance you''re actually in your house looking at transactions that''s quite unique yeah absolutely i had a similar investigation to terrorist financing and i''m thankful i would do not have to be forward deployed to war-torn syria can look at the transactions of an overcover agent you know in my basement at home uh at my own leisure in real time like that is a unique opportunity afforded by a public blockchain very cool so for leo like tether is pretty big in emerging markets what kind of challenges does this bring for compliance because you know in the us or europe or most of asia it''s a different story for compliance than in like southeast asia or africa um so tether has taken very proactive steps to ensure that we have the cleanest and safest network that we can have uh and we do this probably in two different ways uh kind of what we do directly and what we do indirectly and so with emerging markets and other markets that we think are important to us we''ve taken the measures to uh actually proactively reach out to law enforcement usually beginning with the state police in order to uh connect with them build a communications bridge that is highly efficient where they understand uh what our capabilities are and we understand what their capabilities are uh we understand how to communicate with each other very quickly what kind of information we need in order to uh undergo a freeze quickly uh we''ll often do cross training so they''ll tell us about what they''re seeing and we''ll also explain to them some typologies that we''ve seen and in this way we set up um basically a system uh that''s very efficient and very effective um i can give an example uh last year we uh started a latam initiative where we went uh proactively to brazil uh chile and argentina in order to do exactly this uh and this allows us to uh begin the relationship in a jurisdiction in the right way in the way that we think is the the correct way by putting compliance first by putting anti-money laundering practices first so that''s something that we do very directly with law enforcement worldwide uh it''s not only uh in you know countries where we are based it''s all over the world and more recently we''re even working with a governance uh institution we were not quite yet to announce it um publicly but we''re actually helping uh a massive uh global governance institution to train law enforcement in some of the poorest countries in the world to use open source intelligence tools in order to trace uh transactions and and um potential criminal activity uh using blockchain explorers osin scrapers and things of that nature and so we''re very active with law enforcement worldwide to keep the network as safe as possible uh that''s what we do directly more indirectly though i think that the way that uh anti-money laundering works is is in a way decentralized and uh what i mean by that is that every country creates their own anti-money laundering uh regulations that they then pass on to their regulated uh uh entities like financial institutions or vast virtual asset service providers in most countries and so every um entity uh that has customers and serves uh you know services crypto uh products and services they have their own aml responsibilities uh for their each of their customers and whenever they identify suspicious activity they report it to their local fiu and so you have vasps doing this all over the world reporting this to financial investigations units financial investigation units then share that information with each other globally and so one thing that tether does is as we expand our network and we either partner directly or uh you know help to grow different companies we are very interested in knowing what their aml compliance program looks like and we believe that uh where a company has an excellent aml compliance regime and we you know kick the the tires on that to make sure that that''s uh the truth that''s a very good sign for us us that''s a company that is forward thinking that''s thinking about uh long-term success and i think that the the more such partners we have worldwide in developing uh countries and as well as in developed countries the the better chances are that we grow a very clean network and and so we like to work with those sorts of companies well it''s also it''s pretty cool that developing you know world law enforcement agencies now have crypto training and it really shows the future of finance starts with that where emerging markets have police officers that are crypto native where the fbi or like you know in canada the rcmp might not have that same skill set but they do in say brazil or colombia or chile or somewhere um they certainly have that skill set in the us and canada as well i know but the point being is that the future of finance starts with training up law enforcement in emerging markets yes very very much agree our partnerships with uh emerging markets are really important and and this is the way we like to expand into jurisdictions uh we are now working with 230 law enforcement agencies worldwide across 53 jurisdictions and we''ve frozen as a company uh over 2.5 billion uh usdt uh we really do believe that uh uh when you have uh when you have kind of the combination of of good regulations good technology that allows for investigations and collaborations with law enforcement with blockchain tracing companies with blockchains like tron um uh etc this is how you keep a good network that will actually be able to scale en masse and meet the requirements uh of uh regulators of governments etc very cool so we have 10 minutes left let''s go around the table and talk about what you guys think will drive adoption in the next year justin you''re first yes for me i believe still it''s the boring topic we talk about today right stable coin the payroll like payment um probably most of the topic media won''t pay attention about actually uh really driving the increase of uh uh uh here okay how about for spear pay yeah what do you see as the next factor to drive adoption you know i think people are still pretty early to the internal uh reconciliation like inventory management game um uh a founder within the space uh uh once told me that payments eventually just becomes compliance and risk uh and that eventually either becomes foreign exchange or high risk lending um and within emerging markets this is so powerful because local payment service providers are always going to know more about how to underwrite a local citizen than say a bank in the developed world um so i think you''re just gonna see a lot more retail adoption and naturally with some of the uh maybe recent acquisitions and fundraising rounds uh institutions are also starting to take a peak uh 10 000 x so hard to argue against very nice for artemis what what do you think yeah i think um very collaborative regulators um which i think is coming in the united states um because i think what people forget is that one of the most popular financial assets that almost all of you have exposure to which are etfs are actually a collaborative project between u.s regulators and financial institutions um and so if we can bring that sort of collaboration between regulators and innovators again into the world we will see crypto proliferate the way etfs proliferated okay but that starts with compliance though right and making sure that there''s rules to be followed in the first place and that companies follow the rules in crypto absolutely um compliance again in a collaborative manner as opposed to like anti-crypto you know operational truck point 2.0 type style like sort of burn everything kind of regulation exactly how about 4trm yeah i love the etf answer like i think of my parents they''re never going to bridge assets between blockchains right but they will put money in my children''s college savings plans that may have a bitcoin etf so seeing more uh situations like that where more people can be exposed to crypto for positive things uh and then given being the uh token investigator here i think i''m gonna go with just like building trust finding more ways that people can uh see accountability in a blockchain knowing that when they put money into some type of vehicle uh in crypto they''ll be able to get it back eventually or the product''s gonna do exactly what it is uh and finding more ways like t3 to be able to uh deter illicit actors from going to a blockchain it''s never going to be zero right all the reasons we talked about of why crypto is efficient uh low cost is going to attract illicit actors we can''t stop that but what can we do to try and keep it minimum i think it''s going to help build more confidence and more people in it for the future okay how about for tether uh like i said i think the combination of good regulations technology and collaboration is what really will lead everything but but i think first and foremost good regulation is important i''m currently tracking uh upcoming stablecoin regulations that are uh incoming in many parts of the world including the developing world and i believe that there is um there are a lot of uh institutions that already have a large retail market of their own who are waiting for regulatory clarity in order to create new and innovative products that are a lot more efficient than what they have to offer right now through the use of stable coins and i think that as these regulations uh come to bear we''ll see that a lot of institutional uh players will actually uh begin to create more products with stable coins in countries where uh stability is not uh taken for granted and so if you''re in europe if you''re in uh us or canada for example you''re used to having a stable currency it''s not a novel thing and you have many ways to pay for coffees you have uh email transfers and you know many credit cards etc uh but if you''re in a high inflation environment uh things are a lot different and so i think in those countries it''ll be very exciting as uh regulations for stable coins uh come to fruition uh the ability to create the products that perhaps we take for granted in developed countries in those nations i guess we''re kind of spoiled in the west where we have visa tap to pay amex lots of dollar access and we might not appreciate the fact the person in you know chile or somewhere where it''s inflation prone or argentina has to figure out inflation to buy milk or to buy groceries absolutely and this is why i think heather works so well it''s uh usdt offers stability all over the world uh in a very fast and efficient manner and um you know we take this very seriously we understand that this is something that can help uh the whole of the developing world and that''s why we put uh aml compliance first that''s why we put collaborations with law enforcement first because the only way that this will work the only way that governments can trust this is if they understand that uh there is a way to freeze illicit funds there is someone you can contact in order to uh help uh deter identify and and stop uh criminal activity very nice so justin need the last word what''s next for you guys for compliance yeah i think for t3 so first i''m super grateful for tether tm labs and tron team to collaborate together to build this project i think we will continue to invest into this project to continue to grow because i believe the stablecoin market cap overall will triple right even 10x in the next 10 years so i think we will continue to invest into this group and to set like a role model for uh global like regulators um there is some uh past group or some people in the private sector you can come up very nice okay guys that was great fun thanks so much thank you thanks everyone bye', 'so we all know justin''s son the man that needs no intro whatsoever but we don''t know these guys on stage and they''re very important people in the good fight against crypto crime so let''s start here uh with you give us a quick intro who you are what you''re doing and how you''re going to fight crypto crime great to meet you run uh yeah thanks for having me here at consensus i''m anthony i''m one of the co-founders of artemis uh we''re a crypto data provider that we''re trying to bring truth to crypto um so uh organizations like visa paypal standard charter use us uh to understand what people are actually doing on crypto what apps are they using uh where are they from um and what types of payments are they''re doing and so you know i think crypto is still unfortunately you know full of sketchy stuff and we hope to bring light and truth to crypto and and promote crypto to be the you know the future of finance excellent go ahead yeah yeah i''m testing oh it works uh my name is arnold i''m ceo co-founder of sphere uh we developed sphere pay uh which is the fastest on and off ramp in the world uh to my knowledge um and we do that using stable coins uh and lower level bank messaging optimization so effectively explicitly defining uh the way that the money flows through banks uh which as i''m sure we''ll discuss ends up being quite the headache um simultaneously we''re developing sphere net uh which is a private svm cluster uh that automatically runs things like transaction monitoring risk scoring uh some pretty cool uh tie-ins with zero knowledge proofs uh for regulated fintechs who might not know as much about blockchain uh but really see the use cases of stable coins and want an easy way to get started um and yeah mostly active in ladam uh apac the u.s uh and mostly support v2b fintechs uh pleasure to meet you all okay cool so chris who are you my name is chris jian chesky i''m the head of global investigations at trm labs we''re a blockchain analytics company i''ve been here for about two and a half years prior to that i was a special agent in irs crew investigation in the united states and uh happy to be here thanks for having me okay and uh leo right there hi everyone i''m really happy to be a part of this panel uh particularly with such um great panelists here with me uh my name is leonardo real leo it''s easier though and i''m heather''s chief compliance officer a role i''ve had since 2018 i''m in charge of the regulated activity including anti-money laundering uh but tether is a really unique company in that unlike most uh let''s say vasps we''re not singularly concerned with um the activity of our customers uh we''re also concerned with the secondary market which has hundreds of millions of users uh so it''s a very interesting role very cool and now we have justin''s son from tron we all know him so justin i heard that the t3 group which is tether tron trm which is looking to fight crypto crime it was your idea so what''s the story there yes um so first of all i think the uh combat elixir activity on the blockchain is not easy right it''s uh require uh data analysis require um real time like monitoring um it''s also requires like uh report you know i need to find the right person here um i''m really grateful you know um with the work of um tether you know kiam at labs and the tron uh we can all um bring together uh and the show to the regulators and the law enforcement in the world actually we have the professional team uh on those uh uh uh tasks and we make sure uh those tasks uh get down um and and also um i think um for example like uh not like everyone you know in crypto has this kind of the tech force you know focus on this kind of the specific task uh our um task group is um is permanent right so we have the full-time employee um postage updates um update uh uh every quarter and we have tasks uh basically collaborate with the law enforcement uh like every day uh i think by the time pass you know we will see uh more and more job get down uh and and and uh global wise i think the legal authorities uh will believe you know crypto is uh wow the best way to chase the back actor uh um and be transparent right about like all the things happen on the blockchain we can prove to everybody what happened so that''s i think the uh wow the best thing happened uh in the crypto okay very cool so chris you are ex-fbi and ex-irr irsci and you know you have fought crime for your whole career how is crypto different in crime fighting because i''m sure there are similar elements across all kinds of crime but like how is crypto unique in this regards yeah great question so uh when i went to the academy one of the things they hammer home to you as an irs special agent is following the money if you can follow the money you can find out who''s conducting the illicit activity behind it and certainly there''s no truer place for that to happen than with crypto particularly with the public blockchain and so having that skill set is really useful because it applies to so many different types of threat landscapes whether that''s sanctions evasion terrorist financing child exploitation if you can if you can follow the money you can figure that out and um this t3 has really been a probably one of the most exciting opportunities we''ve had at tm in the past couple years that i''ve been here one because just seen how quickly law enforcement has gravitated towards it we''ve been successful on five different continents multiple different jurisdictions i''m sure we''ll talk about frozen over 131 million dollars and it''s been a broad swath of crimes too from money launderers again like terrorist financing narcotics trafficking and scams um and i think ultimately just being able to have a public blockchain allows people like us that may not have access to information like we don''t have to go to the bank to get their records to see what happened to somebody''s account you can access them the public blockchain and so a lot of the cases that we''ve teed up have also been proactive we''ve gone to places like chain abuse and sourced victim reports and be able to confirm their allegations on a public blockchain and trying to do a lot of the work as much as we can for law enforcement around the world okay cool because you know with evidence you have certain standards to use right like a screenshot of etherscan just won''t cut it so how does tear on labs produce evidence to be used in investigations and prosecution uh well one of the things i think i''m most proud about of our global investigations team has a lot of former law enforcement like myself so not only would i say that they''re probably some of the best crypto tracers in the world but they also understand just investigations in general they understand the context the context behind the transactions and like the human who''s ultimately conducting those transactions so how does that fit in how can law enforcement use this string of transactions to then be able to articulate probable cause to be able to get a search warrant so using like their historical experiences uh using the context of what''s happening uh with the transactions online but then also that whatever information we can also find with it maybe we can make some connections to twitter to someone''s like uh vanity username maybe there''s some forum somewhere somewhere where somebody had some type of connection and like really having this whole puzzle that you''re able to build out uh particularly from an online public persona uh is i think really critical can get um an investigation a lot of where it needs to go but then ultimately law enforcement can use their authorities and the information they have to take it even steps further okay interesting now for tether why is it important to be part of this you know why is it important that you guys work with tron and trm labs in this effort so it''s important because trm labs is and sorry tron is is the blockchain that''s most used uh by the world uh in terms of usdt usage of course tether already had an external investigations team prior to trm where we were already working with global law enforcement uh but i think it''s really important that where we can uh leverage the the network of some of our trusted partners it just makes sense to be able to do that and so uh tron has a great network trm obviously has a great set of investigators with amazing skill sets and to be able to work with them um in a very fast way is a big game changer for tether uh the name of the game when it comes to blockchain investigations is speed uh if you aren''t fast enough to uh get information to the right authorities uh and to tether to freeze uh very quickly then you might have a situation where uh funds are dissipated to another blockchain that maybe isn''t feasible or uh through some serve mixing service uh where you might lose sight of the uh of the funds and so um having such great partners who understand the game who understand investigations who are very diligent and want to work quickly is super important and we''re very happy to be a part of this uh partnership cool so from tether''s point of view like what does it look like when you guys work with tron and trm labs in freezing funds like walk us through the step by step how it works um so in in terms of step by step we have a global investigations team on our side uh we have uh an investigations team where we''ve sourced people from former law enforcement agencies uh prosecutors offices uh investigators in banking as well as uh blockchain forensics experts and so we have a team that really understands uh the blockchain and they''ve been working already on their own with law law enforcement like i said uh previously uh but but basically um tron and trm are uh engaged constantly with law enforcement worldwide they have a fantastic network of uh law enforcement they''re conducting their own uh and osint investigations and almost kind of tee up uh potential investigations that are in line with uh the sorts of crime typologies that uh tether is interested in uh looking at and uh and that we collaborate with each other in order to stop uh we we''ve come to know how to work with each other we understand the uh risk tolerance that the companies have and uh we''re basically uh uh forwarded different cases uh that we assess and assess at the same time that law enforcement is looking at this and wherever possible uh we quickly organize the appropriate key signers on our side to uh freeze funds as quickly as possible okay cool and then continue to work with law enforcement throughout the case very nice all right so for the t3 group is there like a case you''re most proud of like which bust do you think was your most important one in the last year chris how about you chris do you want to take that one yeah sure um i think we highlighted one most recently with spain which i think was pretty impactful that in itself was about 27 million that was frozen and i think what was really kind of unique about that one is they gave us a heads up that they had an operation coming um certainly didn''t give us all the details of the operation but pertaining to the side of crypto they knew that they wanted to freeze these funds and uh as many people in law enforcement know that like once you go knock on a door anything can happen and that can include those funds being dispersed all over the world change to different assets and so timing was pretty critical we had about two days or so to get everything um analyzed to have everything ready to go and have it to uh meeting the risk standards for tether to be able to go and then there was a hard deadline things wheels were in motion to have it go and i think that one was probably the most impressive because if we weren''t able to work together from the public side to the private side and the partners within t3 to have that queued up uh that money might have been in the wind and they weren''t going to hold back the on the ground operations that they had because uh we couldn''t get our uh ducks in a row and thankfully we were able to wow it''s like that show 24 right it''s all about being urgent it''s being quick you know yeah it''s exactly like that nobody ever eats it just cuts and then you just go on to the next one okay very nice um so for arnold so you guys work a lot with the real world use cases of blockchain and crypto like payments and that kind of stuff and payroll so how do stable coins help with that you know why can''t i just run payroll through like ach or something you know how do stable coins help and also like what are the challenges uh involved in this yeah uh so stable coins are super useful because they''re a proxy for a dollar account uh dollar accounts are typically permissioned by american banks uh and with a stable coin you basically get a permissionless uh up to you to lose it uh dollar account no matter where you are in the world um if you don''t speak english you know all of your documentation is not in english uh kind of makes sense that it''s hard to get a dollar account from an american bank and as a result it''s been pretty incredible sort of the coinciding of threads between people getting access to dollar accounts and also coming online for the first time uh you know we''re pretty active in lat am costa rica hit internet majority penetration about a decade later than the united states and the general adoption of like e-commerce fintech because internet companies need to make money has led to some pretty surprising use cases invoice factoring being an example you know because you now have a dollar account someone can take risk uh and advancing your payment uh and you know generating yield on the back end i''ve met an amazing brazilian company actually here who does that works with like the coca colas of the world um i think the other really interesting one is internal uh inventory management yeah so if you''re familiar with like airwall x or wise or some of these more traditional payments companies stripe they typically have to use swift to send money to their own bank accounts they hold like pools liquidity scattered throughout the world uh and that''s how you get money locally stable coins make that 10 000 x faster but i think the challenge really comes back to swift and part of where we''ve been able to see latency improvements is that if you''re outside of the country where the issuer is or where the market maker is it still takes forever it still takes two three five ten days to get in and out of stable coins which kind of like defeats the point of being able to send a stable coin so being able to do that same day uh a moniker we like to use is there is no like costa rica or sorry there is no silicon valley of costa rica means that capital efficiency is super important latency risk because you know if you hold cop overnight colombian peso you could lose 10 of your balance sheet makes tackling some of those less obvious frictions with swift even with stables that much more important okay now what about then for artemis right you guys are in blockchain intelligence you know and all these use cases have intelligence part to it right like there is challenges and threats but you guys are working to like you know help the concerns of trad fi and of stakeholders in making sure blockchain is clean yeah and so from what we''re seeing i think um you know i think there are two angles one is that everybody even though you know stable coins don''t go up in value uh traditional finance uh has been asking us uh like day in day out um like how much stable coins are in the system is it going up like is there more supply and the reason being that uh stable coins are liquidity and lifeblood of any any network and so ultimately these traditional finance investors care about buying a token like swana or ethereum is it going to go up and so if there''s more clean state uh stable coin supply on these networks uh that are powering real use cases naturally these networks value will go up and so again even though you can''t invest in stable coins stable coins are very very important uh to the sort of yeah the the livelihood and health of a of a network for sure and you''re also ex-trad fi is that correct so one of your trad fi colleagues talking about stable coins is on their radar or is it still something they are going to ignore or what uh they definitely cannot ignore it so i would say we started artemis about three years ago um and i think the only people are talking about stable coins are sort of dex traders who are trying to you know bring liquidity into into crypto but um fast forward to 24 everybody so you know i used to work at paypal i was there for six years uh they are knocking down on our door be like hey we need stable coin data right now we are literally we cannot we do not understand what''s going on and we want to know because we want to get into the action and so i would say yeah 2024 was the year of stable coins and i think 2025 will be also continue to be this year of stable coins but then paypal won''t get involved if they think that stable coins facilitate you know drugs and crime and that kind of stuff yes exactly so that the question they ask us is hey what are people doing with stable coins and so there''s this kind of strange chicken and egg problem here where it''s like the you know these public companies in the us won''t go into stable coins unless they know what''s going on and they know it''s clean but then there''s no real good data on like what the uh what the clean usages are and so that''s where kind of artemis comes in where we highlight a lot of these like use cases like what you know what arno just was talking about with severe pay i can name like 10 other companies that are doing something uh they''re really interesting you know not just trading um and you know it''s just like these companies aren''t being highlighted what being highlighted is trump launching a meme coin and it''s kind of unfortunate it''s also kind of annoying that you know the meme coins in some ways get the attention when things like payments and payroll and the so-called boring stuff of crypto of sorry trad five rather is on crypto now but not getting the headlines yes exactly um i i actually got a really interesting anecdote yesterday from a large asset manager uh they were like hey the you know i asked them what what''s holding back crypto and he was like honestly the wall street journal and financial times all these folks just need to cover the real use cases of crypto because all they cover are like trump stuff and so it''s just gonna you know incite fear into the you know the public mainstream mindset but as they say if it bleeds it leads right in media so yeah so justin um tron right now has 62 billion in stable coins on the network how do we get to 75 or 100 billion what''s the next step yes um so first of all i i think thanks to uh the tether um power right so we have seen uh one or two billion of usdt increase on tron network uh every month i think the majority of them contribute to the um users action actually uh tron uh um 62 uh billion dollars reserve it''s just uh one number i think i have been like more focused on actually we have around 20 to 30 billion dollars uh worth of the transaction volume happen on the network every day i think this is more important and approved to everybody um tether has been used like very actively uh among you the users in the group uh because for ethereum for example uh even ethereum has the equivalent amount of the tether on ethereum but the problem for those ethereum uh the transsector volume is only 10 billion dollars it''s only uh probably 30 percent of the uh tron volume so that''s why i think our um as a network operator uh our mission is to collaborate with tether uh to make sure the users uh use this stable coin um in the way they want and to guarantee cheap uh faster uh instant transaction uh and they basically can make transaction anytime they want they can deliver the cash uh to uh to uh to the destination um so uh so that''s why i think also while the secret recipe of like tron network uh how it got you know so big you know successful um i think we will continue to do that uh we want to deliver this to um to the customer and also uh um with the you know service quality provided by tether uh we want this to be uh uh you know uh available infrastructure for people globally yeah and then we can''t get to that point if it''s not a clean network if politicians around the world think that stable coins equal drugs and bad actors we gotta keep this clean yeah yes definitely so uh we want like politician law enforcement trust this network too right so i i don''t want to give them like an impression once you know any fund goes to crypto it''s like goes to um um basically a dart hole or anything right it''s it''s impossible to trace anymore you know uh the bad actor is just get away with it right with the funds you know it''s gone so uh we we want to deliver uh this message to to the regulators it''s like crypto is the same space it''s just like serves the users better right it''s a cheap fast instant transaction but that that it does not mean you know it''s a black hole you know once the funds going there it''s gone you know we''re gonna find like everything we can um by uh uh establishing a very professional team you know making uh phone tracing report you know focus on that uh as chris you know just mentioned you know even a few days you know uh ahead of notice is enough you know we will do whatever we can to help law enforcement to get get back the money yeah for sure um so going over the sphere how do you guys work with trm to make sure that your payroll and your fund flow is clean yeah so you know compliance on chain companies like trm uh basically label cluster various wallets so that way you can check wallets the transactions that are associated with them and basically build like a heat map of like where you know suspicious activity occurring and so naturally we would run that through all the transactions that we facilitate uh supplementing of course uh more traditional i''ll call it aml vendors on the bank side it''s that combination that really makes it rock solid because you get it on chain you get it from the sending bank you get it from the receiving bank so three layers of you know sanity checks to make sure that there''s nothing wrong going on um i think the future uh though will be uh this like weird uh maybe marriage between traditional and on-chain compliance where right now like run times on chains don''t really differentiate uh between transaction or account types uh in the same way that they would on a traditional fintech ledger um and you know hopefully this allows us uh not to make it a meme but say ai agents come on and make some of that manual work uh and compliance escalation easier uh you combine that with the work that''s being done on zero knowledge proofs and you can start to bake some of these uh controls uh that you would normally pay like a unit 21 on the fiat side for you can bring that data on chain and make it easier for companies like trm uh to really monitor the whole end-to-end picture uh not just like what''s coming from exchanges or maybe being bridged uh but you know coming from the fiat world uh and going to it interesting okay so for chris for trm like what''s unique about sphere and the challenges you might see in payroll and stuff like that for fraud like is that provide a very unique and different way to look at fraud versus just like transactions permittances is there something there yeah i think so like in crypto investigations it''s very important to find these kind of cash out these on-ramps off-ramps of where crypto connects to the real world so you can follow you know a bitcoin transaction all these circles uh but at the end of the day somebody usually wants to use those funds to pay for something right and so having a company that''s you know facilitating payroll and other ways to distribute funds like you want to make sure that those are legitimate off-ramps you want to make sure those aren''t ghost employees you want to make sure there isn''t some types of sanctions invasion going on uh certainly my colleagues back at the iras would make a statement about tax evasion as well and so you know there are many different um specific i''ll say threats to be able to focus on so like this just mentioned um there''s the traditional fiat side of it and looking like who are these people are legitimate but then also from the payment side where are the funds coming from where are they going i think it''s you know kind of unique and crypto sometimes hold themselves to a higher standard even like if you think of a bank and somebody deposits cash and says here like to put this in my account where''d you get it from like my grandma gave it for me well like the conversation is kind of over right like you''re going to follow the cash backwards and like look at security footage all the street cameras for the past years like no but in the crypto world you can take those hops backwards and see like oh you said you got this on thursday but really the transaction that''s funniness uh occurred like four years ago and it''s from a dark net market or something like that and so there are many more um opportunities in crypto to be able to kind of uh make sure that those transactions are safer yeah it''s funny actually you can be a cop and work from home with crypto you''re not out in the field not doing surveillance you''re actually in your house looking at transactions that''s quite unique yeah absolutely i had a similar investigation to terrorist financing and i''m thankful i would do not have to be forward deployed to war-torn syria can look at the transactions of an overcover agent you know in my basement at home uh at my own leisure in real time like that is a unique opportunity afforded by a public blockchain very cool so for leo like tether is pretty big in emerging markets what kind of challenges does this bring for compliance because you know in the us or europe or most of asia it''s a different story for compliance than in like southeast asia or africa um so tether has taken very proactive steps to ensure that we have the cleanest and safest network that we can have uh and we do this probably in two different ways uh kind of what we do directly and what we do indirectly and so with emerging markets and other markets that we think are important to us we''ve taken the measures to uh actually proactively reach out to law enforcement usually beginning with the state police in order to uh connect with them build a communications bridge that is highly efficient where they understand uh what our capabilities are and we understand what their capabilities are uh we understand how to communicate with each other very quickly what kind of information we need in order to uh undergo a freeze quickly uh we''ll often do cross training so they''ll tell us about what they''re seeing and we''ll also explain to them some typologies that we''ve seen and in this way we set up um basically a system uh that''s very efficient and very effective um i can give an example uh last year we uh started a latam initiative where we went uh proactively to brazil uh chile and argentina in order to do exactly this uh and this allows us to uh begin the relationship in a jurisdiction in the right way in the way that we think is the the correct way by putting compliance first by putting anti-money laundering practices first so that''s something that we do very directly with law enforcement worldwide uh it''s not only uh in you know countries where we are based it''s all over the world and more recently we''re even working with a governance uh institution we were not quite yet to announce it um publicly but we''re actually helping uh a massive uh global governance institution to train law enforcement in some of the poorest countries in the world to use open source intelligence tools in order to trace uh transactions and and um potential criminal activity uh using blockchain explorers osin scrapers and things of that nature and so we''re very active with law enforcement worldwide to keep the network as safe as possible uh that''s what we do directly more indirectly though i think that the way that uh anti-money laundering works is is in a way decentralized and uh what i mean by that is that every country creates their own anti-money laundering uh regulations that they then pass on to their regulated uh uh entities like financial institutions or vast virtual asset service providers in most countries and so every um entity uh that has customers and serves uh you know services crypto uh products and services they have their own aml responsibilities uh for their each of their customers and whenever they identify suspicious activity they report it to their local fiu and so you have vasps doing this all over the world reporting this to financial investigations units financial investigation units then share that information with each other globally and so one thing that tether does is as we expand our network and we either partner directly or uh you know help to grow different companies we are very interested in knowing what their aml compliance program looks like and we believe that uh where a company has an excellent aml compliance regime and we you know kick the the tires on that to make sure that that''s uh the truth that''s a very good sign for us us that''s a company that is forward thinking that''s thinking about uh long-term success and i think that the the more such partners we have worldwide in developing uh countries and as well as in developed countries the the better chances are that we grow a very clean network and and so we like to work with those sorts of companies well it''s also it''s pretty cool that developing you know world law enforcement agencies now have crypto training and it really shows the future of finance starts with that where emerging markets have police officers that are crypto native where the fbi or like you know in canada the rcmp might not have that same skill set but they do in say brazil or colombia or chile or somewhere um they certainly have that skill set in the us and canada as well i know but the point being is that the future of finance starts with training up law enforcement in emerging markets yes very very much agree our partnerships with uh emerging markets are really important and and this is the way we like to expand into jurisdictions uh we are now working with 230 law enforcement agencies worldwide across 53 jurisdictions and we''ve frozen as a company uh over 2.5 billion uh usdt uh we really do believe that uh uh when you have uh when you have kind of the combination of of good regulations good technology that allows for investigations and collaborations with law enforcement with blockchain tracing companies with blockchains like tron um uh etc this is how you keep a good network that will actually be able to scale en masse and meet the requirements uh of uh regulators of governments etc very cool so we have 10 minutes left let''s go around the table and talk about what you guys think will drive adoption in the next year justin you''re first yes for me i believe still it''s the boring topic we talk about today right stable coin the payroll like payment um probably most of the topic media won''t pay attention about actually uh really driving the increase of uh uh uh here okay how about for spear pay yeah what do you see as the next factor to drive adoption you know i think people are still pretty early to the internal uh reconciliation like inventory management game um uh a founder within the space uh uh once told me that payments eventually just becomes compliance and risk uh and that eventually either becomes foreign exchange or high risk lending um and within emerging markets this is so powerful because local payment service providers are always going to know more about how to underwrite a local citizen than say a bank in the developed world um so i think you''re just gonna see a lot more retail adoption and naturally with some of the uh maybe recent acquisitions and fundraising rounds uh institutions are also starting to take a peak uh 10 000 x so hard to argue against very nice for artemis what what do you think yeah i think um very collaborative regulators um which i think is coming in the united states um because i think what people forget is that one of the most popular financial assets that almost all of you have exposure to which are etfs are actually a collaborative project between u.s regulators and financial institutions um and so if we can bring that sort of collaboration between regulators and innovators again into the world we will see crypto proliferate the way etfs proliferated okay but that starts with compliance though right and making sure that there''s rules to be followed in the first place and that companies follow the rules in crypto absolutely um compliance again in a collaborative manner as opposed to like anti-crypto you know operational truck point 2.0 type style like sort of burn everything kind of regulation exactly how about 4trm yeah i love the etf answer like i think of my parents they''re never going to bridge assets between blockchains right but they will put money in my children''s college savings plans that may have a bitcoin etf so seeing more uh situations like that where more people can be exposed to crypto for positive things uh and then given being the uh token investigator here i think i''m gonna go with just like building trust finding more ways that people can uh see accountability in a blockchain knowing that when they put money into some type of vehicle uh in crypto they''ll be able to get it back eventually or the product''s gonna do exactly what it is uh and finding more ways like t3 to be able to uh deter illicit actors from going to a blockchain it''s never going to be zero right all the reasons we talked about of why crypto is efficient uh low cost is going to attract illicit actors we can''t stop that but what can we do to try and keep it minimum i think it''s going to help build more confidence and more people in it for the future okay how about for tether uh like i said i think the combination of good regulations technology and collaboration is what really will lead everything but but i think first and foremost good regulation is important i''m currently tracking uh upcoming stablecoin regulations that are uh incoming in many parts of the world including the developing world and i believe that there is um there are a lot of uh institutions that already have a large retail market of their own who are waiting for regulatory clarity in order to create new and innovative products that are a lot more efficient than what they have to offer right now through the use of stable coins and i think that as these regulations uh come to bear we''ll see that a lot of institutional uh players will actually uh begin to create more products with stable coins in countries where uh stability is not uh taken for granted and so if you''re in europe if you''re in uh us or canada for example you''re used to having a stable currency it''s not a novel thing and you have many ways to pay for coffees you have uh email transfers and you know many credit cards etc uh but if you''re in a high inflation environment uh things are a lot different and so i think in those countries it''ll be very exciting as uh regulations for stable coins uh come to fruition uh the ability to create the products that perhaps we take for granted in developed countries in those nations i guess we''re kind of spoiled in the west where we have visa tap to pay amex lots of dollar access and we might not appreciate the fact the person in you know chile or somewhere where it''s inflation prone or argentina has to figure out inflation to buy milk or to buy groceries absolutely and this is why i think heather works so well it''s uh usdt offers stability all over the world uh in a very fast and efficient manner and um you know we take this very seriously we understand that this is something that can help uh the whole of the developing world and that''s why we put uh aml compliance first that''s why we put collaborations with law enforcement first because the only way that this will work the only way that governments can trust this is if they understand that uh there is a way to freeze illicit funds there is someone you can contact in order to uh help uh deter identify and and stop uh criminal activity very nice so justin need the last word what''s next for you guys for compliance yeah i think for t3 so first i''m super grateful for tether tm labs and tron team to collaborate together to build this project i think we will continue to invest into this project to continue to grow because i believe the stablecoin market cap overall will triple right even 10x in the next 10 years so i think we will continue to invest into this group and to set like a role model for uh global like regulators um there is some uh past group or some people in the private sector you can come up very nice okay guys that was great fun thanks so much thank you thanks everyone bye', '["so we all know justin''s son the man that needs no intro whatsoever but we don''t know these guys on stage and they''re very important people in the good fight against crypto crime so let''s start here uh with you give us a quick intro who you are what you''re doing and how you''re going to fight crypto crime great to meet you run uh yeah thanks for having me here at consensus i''m anthony i''m one of the co-founders of artemis uh we''re a crypto data provider that we''re trying to bring truth to crypto um so uh organizations like visa paypal standard charter use us uh to understand what people are actually doing on crypto what apps are they using uh where are they from um and what types of payments are they''re doing and so you know i think crypto is still unfortunately you know full of sketchy stuff and we hope to bring light and truth to crypto and and promote crypto to be the you know the future of finance excellent go ahead yeah yeah i''m testing oh it works uh my name is arnold i''m ceo co-founder of sphere uh we developed sphere pay uh which is the fastest on and off ramp in the world uh to my knowledge um and we do that using stable coins uh and lower level bank messaging optimization so effectively explicitly defining uh the way that the money flows through banks uh which as i''m sure we''ll discuss ends up being quite the headache um simultaneously we''re developing sphere net uh which is a private svm cluster uh that automatically runs things like transaction monitoring risk scoring uh some pretty cool uh tie-ins with zero knowledge proofs uh for regulated fintechs who might not know as much about blockchain uh but really see the use cases of stable coins and want an easy way to get started um and yeah mostly active in ladam uh apac the u.s uh and mostly support v2b fintechs uh pleasure to meet you all okay cool so chris who are you my name is chris jian chesky i''m the head of global investigations at trm labs we''re a blockchain analytics company i''ve been here for about two and a half years prior to that i was a special agent in irs crew investigation in the united states and uh happy to be here thanks for having me okay and uh leo right there hi everyone i''m really happy to be a part of this panel uh particularly with such um great panelists here with me uh my name is leonardo real leo it''s easier though and i''m heather''s chief compliance officer a role i''ve had since 2018 i''m in charge of the regulated activity including anti-money laundering uh but tether is a really unique company in that unlike most uh let''s say vasps we''re not singularly concerned with um the activity of our customers uh we''re also concerned with the secondary market which has hundreds of millions of users uh so it''s a very interesting role very cool and now we have justin''s son from tron we all know him so justin i heard that the t3 group which is tether tron trm which is looking to fight crypto crime it was your idea so what''s the story there yes um so first of all i think the uh combat elixir activity on the blockchain is not easy right it''s uh require uh data analysis require um real time like monitoring um it''s also requires like uh report you know i need to find the right person here um i''m really grateful you know um with the work of um tether you know kiam at labs and the tron uh we can all um bring together uh and the show to the regulators and the law enforcement in the world actually we have the professional team uh on those uh uh uh tasks and we make sure uh those tasks uh get down um and and also um i think um for example like uh not like everyone you know in crypto has this kind of the tech force you know focus on this kind of the specific task uh our um task group is um is permanent right so we have the full-time employee um postage updates um update uh uh every quarter and we have tasks uh basically collaborate with the law enforcement uh like every day uh i think by the time pass you know we will see uh more and more job get down uh and and and uh global wise i think the legal authorities uh will believe you know crypto is uh wow the best way to chase the back actor uh um and be transparent right about like all the things happen on the blockchain we can prove to everybody what happened so that''s i think the uh wow the best thing happened uh in the crypto okay very cool so chris you are ex-fbi and ex-irr irsci and you know you have fought crime for your whole career how is crypto different in crime fighting because i''m sure there are similar elements across all kinds of crime but like how is crypto unique in this regards yeah great question so uh when i went to the academy one of the things they hammer home to you as an irs special agent is following the money if you can follow the money you can find out who''s conducting the illicit activity behind it and certainly there''s no truer place for that to happen than with crypto particularly with the public blockchain and so having that skill set is really useful because it applies to so many different types of threat landscapes whether that''s sanctions evasion terrorist financing child exploitation if you can if you can follow the money you can figure that out and um this t3 has really been a probably one of the most exciting opportunities we''ve had at tm in the past couple years that i''ve been here one because just seen how quickly law enforcement has gravitated towards it we''ve been successful on five different continents multiple different jurisdictions i''m sure we''ll talk about frozen over 131 million dollars and it''s been a broad swath of crimes too from money launderers again like terrorist financing narcotics trafficking and scams um and i think ultimately just being able to have a public blockchain allows people like us that may not have access to information like we don''t have to go to the bank to get their records to see what happened to somebody''s account you can access them the public blockchain and so a lot of the cases that we''ve teed up have also been proactive we''ve gone to places like chain abuse and sourced victim reports and be able to confirm their allegations on a public blockchain and trying to do a lot of the work as much as we can for law enforcement around the world okay cool because you know with evidence you have certain standards to use right like a screenshot of etherscan just won''t cut it so how does tear on labs produce evidence to be used in investigations and prosecution uh well one of the things i think i''m most proud about of our global investigations team has a lot of former law enforcement like myself so not only would i say that they''re probably some of the best crypto tracers in the world but they also understand just investigations in general they understand the context the context behind the transactions and like the human who''s ultimately conducting those transactions so how does that fit in how can law enforcement use this string of transactions to then be able to articulate probable cause to be able to get a search warrant so using like their historical experiences uh using the context of what''s happening uh with the transactions online but then also that whatever information we can also find with it maybe we can make some connections to twitter to someone''s like uh vanity username maybe there''s some forum somewhere somewhere where somebody had some type of connection and like really having this whole puzzle that you''re able to build out uh particularly from an online public persona uh is i think really critical can get um an investigation a lot of where it needs to go but then ultimately law enforcement can use their authorities and the information they have to take it even steps further okay interesting now for tether why is it important to be part of this you know why is it important that you guys work with tron and trm labs in this effort so it''s important because trm labs is and sorry tron is is the blockchain that''s most used uh by the world uh in terms of usdt usage of course tether already had an external investigations team prior to trm where we were already working with global law enforcement uh but i think it''s really important that where we can uh leverage the the network of some of our trusted partners it just makes sense to be able to do that and so uh tron has a great network trm obviously has a great set of investigators with amazing skill sets and to be able to work with them um in a very fast way is a big game changer for tether uh the name of the game when it comes to blockchain investigations is speed uh if you aren''t fast enough to uh get information to the right authorities uh and to tether to freeze uh very quickly then you might have a situation where uh funds are dissipated to another blockchain that maybe isn''t feasible or uh through some serve mixing service uh where you might lose sight of the uh of the funds and so um having such great partners who understand the game who understand investigations who are very diligent and want to work quickly is super important and we''re very happy to be a part of this uh partnership cool so from tether''s point of view like what does it look like when you guys work with tron and trm labs in freezing funds like walk us through the step by step how it works um so in in terms of step by step we have a global investigations team on our side uh we have uh an investigations team where we''ve sourced people from former law enforcement agencies uh prosecutors offices uh investigators in banking as well as uh blockchain forensics experts and so we have a team that really understands uh the blockchain and they''ve been working already on their own with law law enforcement like i said uh previously uh but but basically um tron and trm are uh engaged constantly with law enforcement worldwide they have a fantastic network of uh law enforcement they''re conducting their own uh and osint investigations and almost kind of tee up uh potential investigations that are in line with uh the sorts of crime typologies that uh tether is interested in uh looking at and uh and that we collaborate with each other in order to stop uh we we''ve come to know how to work with each other we understand the uh risk tolerance that the companies have and uh we''re basically uh uh forwarded different cases uh that we assess and assess at the same time that law enforcement is looking at this and wherever possible uh we quickly organize the appropriate key signers on our side to uh freeze funds as quickly as possible okay cool and then continue to work with law enforcement throughout the case very nice all right so for the t3 group is there like a case you''re most proud of like which bust do you think was your most important one in the last year chris how about you chris do you want to take that one yeah sure um i think we highlighted one most recently with spain which i think was pretty impactful that in itself was about 27 million that was frozen and i think what was really kind of unique about that one is they gave us a heads up that they had an operation coming um certainly didn''t give us all the details of the operation but pertaining to the side of crypto they knew that they wanted to freeze these funds and uh as many people in law enforcement know that like once you go knock on a door anything can happen and that can include those funds being dispersed all over the world change to different assets and so timing was pretty critical we had about two days or so to get everything um analyzed to have everything ready to go and have it to uh meeting the risk standards for tether to be able to go and then there was a hard deadline things wheels were in motion to have it go and i think that one was probably the most impressive because if we weren''t able to work together from the public side to the private side and the partners within t3 to have that queued up uh that money might have been in the wind and they weren''t going to hold back the on the ground operations that they had because uh we couldn''t get our uh ducks in a row and thankfully we were able to wow it''s like that show 24 right it''s all about being urgent it''s being quick you know yeah it''s exactly like that nobody ever eats it just cuts and then you just go on to the next one okay very nice um so for arnold so you guys work a lot with the real world use cases of blockchain and crypto like payments and that kind of stuff and payroll so how do stable coins help with that you know why can''t i just run payroll through like ach or something you know how do stable coins help and also like what are the challenges uh involved in this yeah uh so stable coins are super useful because they''re a proxy for a dollar account uh dollar accounts are typically permissioned by american banks uh and with a stable coin you basically get a permissionless uh up to you to lose it uh dollar account no matter where you are in the world um if you don''t speak english you know all of your documentation is not in english uh kind of makes sense that it''s hard to get a dollar account from an american bank and as a result it''s been pretty incredible sort of the coinciding of threads between people getting access to dollar accounts and also coming online for the first time uh you know we''re pretty active in lat am costa rica hit internet majority penetration about a decade later than the united states and the general adoption of like e-commerce fintech because internet companies need to make money has led to some pretty surprising use cases invoice factoring being an example you know because you now have a dollar account someone can take risk uh and advancing your payment uh and you know generating yield on the back end i''ve met an amazing brazilian company actually here who does that works with like the coca colas of the world um i think the other really interesting one is internal uh inventory management yeah so if you''re familiar with like airwall x or wise or some of these more traditional payments companies stripe they typically have to use swift to send money to their own bank accounts they hold like pools liquidity scattered throughout the world uh and that''s how you get money locally stable coins make that 10 000 x faster but i think the challenge really comes back to swift and part of where we''ve been able to see latency improvements is that if you''re outside of the country where the issuer is or where the market maker is it still takes forever it still takes two three five ten days to get in and out of stable coins which kind of like defeats the point of being able to send a stable coin so being able to do that same day uh a moniker we like to use is there is no like costa rica or sorry there is no silicon valley of costa rica means that capital efficiency is super important latency risk because you know if you hold cop overnight colombian peso you could lose 10 of your balance sheet makes tackling some of those less obvious frictions with swift even with stables that much more important okay now what about then for artemis right you guys are in blockchain intelligence you know and all these use cases have intelligence part to it right like there is challenges and threats but you guys are working to like you know help the concerns of trad fi and of stakeholders in making sure blockchain is clean yeah and so from what we''re seeing i think um you know i think there are two angles one is that everybody even though you know stable coins don''t go up in value uh traditional finance uh has been asking us uh like day in day out um like how much stable coins are in the system is it going up like is there more supply and the reason being that uh stable coins are liquidity and lifeblood of any any network and so ultimately these traditional finance investors care about buying a token like swana or ethereum is it going to go up and so if there''s more clean state uh stable coin supply on these networks uh that are powering real use cases naturally these networks value will go up and so again even though you can''t invest in stable coins stable coins are very very important uh to the sort of yeah the the livelihood and health of a of a network for sure and you''re also ex-trad fi is that correct so one of your trad fi colleagues talking about stable coins is on their radar or is it still something they are going to ignore or what uh they definitely cannot ignore it so i would say we started artemis about three years ago um and i think the only people are talking about stable coins are sort of dex traders who are trying to you know bring liquidity into into crypto but um fast forward to 24 everybody so you know i used to work at paypal i was there for six years uh they are knocking down on our door be like hey we need stable coin data right now we are literally we cannot we do not understand what''s going on and we want to know because we want to get into the action and so i would say yeah 2024 was the year of stable coins and i think 2025 will be also continue to be this year of stable coins but then paypal won''t get involved if they think that stable coins facilitate you know drugs and crime and that kind of stuff yes exactly so that the question they ask us is hey what are people doing with stable coins and so there''s this kind of strange chicken and egg problem here where it''s like the you know these public companies in the us won''t go into stable coins unless they know what''s going on and they know it''s clean but then there''s no real good data on like what the uh what the clean usages are and so that''s where kind of artemis comes in where we highlight a lot of these like use cases like what you know what arno just was talking about with severe pay i can name like 10 other companies that are doing something uh they''re really interesting you know not just trading um and you know it''s just like these companies aren''t being highlighted what being highlighted is trump launching a meme coin and it''s kind of unfortunate it''s also kind of annoying that you know the meme coins in some ways get the attention when things like payments and payroll and the so-called boring stuff of crypto of sorry trad five rather is on crypto now but not getting the headlines yes exactly um i i actually got a really interesting anecdote yesterday from a large asset manager uh they were like hey the you know i asked them what what''s holding back crypto and he was like honestly the wall street journal and financial times all these folks just need to cover the real use cases of crypto because all they cover are like trump stuff and so it''s just gonna you know incite fear into the you know the public mainstream mindset but as they say if it bleeds it leads right in media so yeah so justin um tron right now has 62 billion in stable coins on the network how do we get to 75 or 100 billion what''s the next step yes um so first of all i i think thanks to uh the tether um power right so we have seen uh one or two billion of usdt increase on tron network uh every month i think the majority of them contribute to the um users action actually uh tron uh um 62 uh billion dollars reserve it''s just uh one number i think i have been like more focused on actually we have around 20 to 30 billion dollars uh worth of the transaction volume happen on the network every day i think this is more important and approved to everybody um tether has been used like very actively uh among you the users in the group uh because for ethereum for example uh even ethereum has the equivalent amount of the tether on ethereum but the problem for those ethereum uh the transsector volume is only 10 billion dollars it''s only uh probably 30 percent of the uh tron volume so that''s why i think our um as a network operator uh our mission is to collaborate with tether uh to make sure the users uh use this stable coin um in the way they want and to guarantee cheap uh faster uh instant transaction uh and they basically can make transaction anytime they want they can deliver the cash uh to uh to uh to the destination um so uh so that''s why i think also while the secret recipe of like tron network uh how it got you know so big you know successful um i think we will continue to do that uh we want to deliver this to um to the customer and also uh um with the you know service quality provided by tether uh we want this to be uh uh you know uh available infrastructure for people globally yeah and then we can''t get to that point if it''s not a clean network if politicians around the world think that stable coins equal drugs and bad actors we gotta keep this clean yeah yes definitely so uh we want like politician law enforcement trust this network too right so i i don''t want to give them like an impression once you know any fund goes to crypto it''s like goes to um um basically a dart hole or anything right it''s it''s impossible to trace anymore you know uh the bad actor is just get away with it right with the funds you know it''s gone so uh we we want to deliver uh this message to to the regulators it''s like crypto is the same space it''s just like serves the users better right it''s a cheap fast instant transaction but that that it does not mean you know it''s a black hole you know once the funds going there it''s gone you know we''re gonna find like everything we can um by uh uh establishing a very professional team you know making uh phone tracing report you know focus on that uh as chris you know just mentioned you know even a few days you know uh ahead of notice is enough you know we will do whatever we can to help law enforcement to get get back the money yeah for sure um so going over the sphere how do you guys work with trm to make sure that your payroll and your fund flow is clean yeah so you know compliance on chain companies like trm uh basically label cluster various wallets so that way you can check wallets the transactions that are associated with them and basically build like a heat map of like where you know suspicious activity occurring and so naturally we would run that through all the transactions that we facilitate uh supplementing of course uh more traditional i''ll call it aml vendors on the bank side it''s that combination that really makes it rock solid because you get it on chain you get it from the sending bank you get it from the receiving bank so three layers of you know sanity checks to make sure that there''s nothing wrong going on um i think the future uh though will be uh this like weird uh maybe marriage between traditional and on-chain compliance where right now like run times on chains don''t really differentiate uh between transaction or account types uh in the same way that they would on a traditional fintech ledger um and you know hopefully this allows us uh not to make it a meme but say ai agents come on and make some of that manual work uh and compliance escalation easier uh you combine that with the work that''s being done on zero knowledge proofs and you can start to bake some of these uh controls uh that you would normally pay like a unit 21 on the fiat side for you can bring that data on chain and make it easier for companies like trm uh to really monitor the whole end-to-end picture uh not just like what''s coming from exchanges or maybe being bridged uh but you know coming from the fiat world uh and going to it interesting okay so for chris for trm like what''s unique about sphere and the challenges you might see in payroll and stuff like that for fraud like is that provide a very unique and different way to look at fraud versus just like transactions permittances is there something there yeah i think so like in crypto investigations it''s very important to find these kind of cash out these on-ramps off-ramps of where crypto connects to the real world so you can follow you know a bitcoin transaction all these circles uh but at the end of the day somebody usually wants to use those funds to pay for something right and so having a company that''s you know facilitating payroll and other ways to distribute funds like you want to make sure that those are legitimate off-ramps you want to make sure those aren''t ghost employees you want to make sure there isn''t some types of sanctions invasion going on uh certainly my colleagues back at the iras would make a statement about tax evasion as well and so you know there are many different um specific i''ll say threats to be able to focus on so like this just mentioned um there''s the traditional fiat side of it and looking like who are these people are legitimate but then also from the payment side where are the funds coming from where are they going i think it''s you know kind of unique and crypto sometimes hold themselves to a higher standard even like if you think of a bank and somebody deposits cash and says here like to put this in my account where''d you get it from like my grandma gave it for me well like the conversation is kind of over right like you''re going to follow the cash backwards and like look at security footage all the street cameras for the past years like no but in the crypto world you can take those hops backwards and see like oh you said you got this on thursday but really the transaction that''s funniness uh occurred like four years ago and it''s from a dark net market or something like that and so there are many more um opportunities in crypto to be able to kind of uh make sure that those transactions are safer yeah it''s funny actually you can be a cop and work from home with crypto you''re not out in the field not doing surveillance you''re actually in your house looking at transactions that''s quite unique yeah absolutely i had a similar investigation to terrorist financing and i''m thankful i would do not have to be forward deployed to war-torn syria can look at the transactions of an overcover agent you know in my basement at home uh at my own leisure in real time like that is a unique opportunity afforded by a public blockchain very cool so for leo like tether is pretty big in emerging markets what kind of challenges does this bring for compliance because you know in the us or europe or most of asia it''s a different story for compliance than in like southeast asia or africa um so tether has taken very proactive steps to ensure that we have the cleanest and safest network that we can have uh and we do this probably in two different ways uh kind of what we do directly and what we do indirectly and so with emerging markets and other markets that we think are important to us we''ve taken the measures to uh actually proactively reach out to law enforcement usually beginning with the state police in order to uh connect with them build a communications bridge that is highly efficient where they understand uh what our capabilities are and we understand what their capabilities are uh we understand how to communicate with each other very quickly what kind of information we need in order to uh undergo a freeze quickly uh we''ll often do cross training so they''ll tell us about what they''re seeing and we''ll also explain to them some typologies that we''ve seen and in this way we set up um basically a system uh that''s very efficient and very effective um i can give an example uh last year we uh started a latam initiative where we went uh proactively to brazil uh chile and argentina in order to do exactly this uh and this allows us to uh begin the relationship in a jurisdiction in the right way in the way that we think is the the correct way by putting compliance first by putting anti-money laundering practices first so that''s something that we do very directly with law enforcement worldwide uh it''s not only uh in you know countries where we are based it''s all over the world and more recently we''re even working with a governance uh institution we were not quite yet to announce it um publicly but we''re actually helping uh a massive uh global governance institution to train law enforcement in some of the poorest countries in the world to use open source intelligence tools in order to trace uh transactions and and um potential criminal activity uh using blockchain explorers osin scrapers and things of that nature and so we''re very active with law enforcement worldwide to keep the network as safe as possible uh that''s what we do directly more indirectly though i think that the way that uh anti-money laundering works is is in a way decentralized and uh what i mean by that is that every country creates their own anti-money laundering uh regulations that they then pass on to their regulated uh uh entities like financial institutions or vast virtual asset service providers in most countries and so every um entity uh that has customers and serves uh you know services crypto uh products and services they have their own aml responsibilities uh for their each of their customers and whenever they identify suspicious activity they report it to their local fiu and so you have vasps doing this all over the world reporting this to financial investigations units financial investigation units then share that information with each other globally and so one thing that tether does is as we expand our network and we either partner directly or uh you know help to grow different companies we are very interested in knowing what their aml compliance program looks like and we believe that uh where a company has an excellent aml compliance regime and we you know kick the the tires on that to make sure that that''s uh the truth that''s a very good sign for us us that''s a company that is forward thinking that''s thinking about uh long-term success and i think that the the more such partners we have worldwide in developing uh countries and as well as in developed countries the the better chances are that we grow a very clean network and and so we like to work with those sorts of companies well it''s also it''s pretty cool that developing you know world law enforcement agencies now have crypto training and it really shows the future of finance starts with that where emerging markets have police officers that are crypto native where the fbi or like you know in canada the rcmp might not have that same skill set but they do in say brazil or colombia or chile or somewhere um they certainly have that skill set in the us and canada as well i know but the point being is that the future of finance starts with training up law enforcement in emerging markets yes very very much agree our partnerships with uh emerging markets are really important and and this is the way we like to expand into jurisdictions uh we are now working with 230 law enforcement agencies worldwide across 53 jurisdictions and we''ve frozen as a company uh over 2.5 billion uh usdt uh we really do believe that uh uh when you have uh when you have kind of the combination of of good regulations good technology that allows for investigations and collaborations with law enforcement with blockchain tracing companies with blockchains like tron um uh etc this is how you keep a good network that will actually be able to scale en masse and meet the requirements uh of uh regulators of governments etc very cool so we have 10 minutes left let''s go around the table and talk about what you guys think will drive adoption in the next year justin you''re first yes for me i believe still it''s the boring topic we talk about today right stable coin the payroll like payment um probably most of the topic media won''t pay attention about actually uh really driving the increase of uh uh uh here okay how about for spear pay yeah what do you see as the next factor to drive adoption you know i think people are still pretty early to the internal uh reconciliation like inventory management game um uh a founder within the space uh uh once told me that payments eventually just becomes compliance and risk uh and that eventually either becomes foreign exchange or high risk lending um and within emerging markets this is so powerful because local payment service providers are always going to know more about how to underwrite a local citizen than say a bank in the developed world um so i think you''re just gonna see a lot more retail adoption and naturally with some of the uh maybe recent acquisitions and fundraising rounds uh institutions are also starting to take a peak uh 10 000 x so hard to argue against very nice for artemis what what do you think yeah i think um very collaborative regulators um which i think is coming in the united states um because i think what people forget is that one of the most popular financial assets that almost all of you have exposure to which are etfs are actually a collaborative project between u.s regulators and financial institutions um and so if we can bring that sort of collaboration between regulators and innovators again into the world we will see crypto proliferate the way etfs proliferated okay but that starts with compliance though right and making sure that there''s rules to be followed in the first place and that companies follow the rules in crypto absolutely um compliance again in a collaborative manner as opposed to like anti-crypto you know operational truck point 2.0 type style like sort of burn everything kind of regulation exactly how about 4trm yeah i love the etf answer like i think of my parents they''re never going to bridge assets between blockchains right but they will put money in my children''s college savings plans that may have a bitcoin etf so seeing more uh situations like that where more people can be exposed to crypto for positive things uh and then given being the uh token investigator here i think i''m gonna go with just like building trust finding more ways that people can uh see accountability in a blockchain knowing that when they put money into some type of vehicle uh in crypto they''ll be able to get it back eventually or the product''s gonna do exactly what it is uh and finding more ways like t3 to be able to uh deter illicit actors from going to a blockchain it''s never going to be zero right all the reasons we talked about of why crypto is efficient uh low cost is going to attract illicit actors we can''t stop that but what can we do to try and keep it minimum i think it''s going to help build more confidence and more people in it for the future okay how about for tether uh like i said i think the combination of good regulations technology and collaboration is what really will lead everything but but i think first and foremost good regulation is important i''m currently tracking uh upcoming stablecoin regulations that are uh incoming in many parts of the world including the developing world and i believe that there is um there are a lot of uh institutions that already have a large retail market of their own who are waiting for regulatory clarity in order to create new and innovative products that are a lot more efficient than what they have to offer right now through the use of stable coins and i think that as these regulations uh come to bear we''ll see that a lot of institutional uh players will actually uh begin to create more products with stable coins in countries where uh stability is not uh taken for granted and so if you''re in europe if you''re in uh us or canada for example you''re used to having a stable currency it''s not a novel thing and you have many ways to pay for coffees you have uh email transfers and you know many credit cards etc uh but if you''re in a high inflation environment uh things are a lot different and so i think in those countries it''ll be very exciting as uh regulations for stable coins uh come to fruition uh the ability to create the products that perhaps we take for granted in developed countries in those nations i guess we''re kind of spoiled in the west where we have visa tap to pay amex lots of dollar access and we might not appreciate the fact the person in you know chile or somewhere where it''s inflation prone or argentina has to figure out inflation to buy milk or to buy groceries absolutely and this is why i think heather works so well it''s uh usdt offers stability all over the world uh in a very fast and efficient manner and um you know we take this very seriously we understand that this is something that can help uh the whole of the developing world and that''s why we put uh aml compliance first that''s why we put collaborations with law enforcement first because the only way that this will work the only way that governments can trust this is if they understand that uh there is a way to freeze illicit funds there is someone you can contact in order to uh help uh deter identify and and stop uh criminal activity very nice so justin need the last word what''s next for you guys for compliance yeah i think for t3 so first i''m super grateful for tether tm labs and tron team to collaborate together to build this project i think we will continue to invest into this project to continue to grow because i believe the stablecoin market cap overall will triple right even 10x in the next 10 years so i think we will continue to invest into this group and to set like a role model for uh global like regulators um there is some uh past group or some people in the private sector you can come up very nice okay guys that was great fun thanks so much thank you thanks everyone bye"]', 35, '2025-05-13 11:51:08.447', NULL, NULL, '2025-05-26 14:40:48.588317+08');

Financial and TRON', '未知講者', 'Panel Discussions', ' all right we got a full house for justin''s son so look we all know justin''s son he''s like the star of hong kong crypto but we don''t know this guy right here zach who came all the way from the us to talk to us in hong kong so zach tell us about your crypto origin story and how you came about with world of the foundation and all that good stuff yeah so uh in terms of how i got into crypto i guess we kind of have to take it back before crypto um i went to law school and very quickly i realized i didn''t want to be a lawyer good call yeah probably like within the first year or two i knew i didn''t want to be a lawyer but i mean it was a great experience i learned a lot and uh was really interested in particularly in like real estate contract law stuff like that um and when i came out of law school i actually uh with my partner chase hero founded a digital advertising and customer acquisition business um we focused on marketing customer acquisition product sales and it was about 2016 when a really good friend of mine who''s you know very much in the crypto space uh told me that i needed to read the ethereum white paper now prior to that i already knew about crypto because uh i had a lot of friends that were poker players and they used bitcoin to settle poker transactions um but like i''m not a big poker player myself so i didn''t see the vision of like bitcoin as you know going to revolutionize the global uh financial system you know i didn''t have that early vision and because i wasn''t a poker player i didn''t really dive into bitcoin it just wasn''t that interesting but when i read the ethereum white paper and understood the power of being able to do business with people around the world in a trustless manner where two parties can work together without having to see each other face to face and best of all eliminate the attorneys yeah you know i we work with a lot of lawyers so you know don''t get me wrong they''re great people but uh i realized that this was going to revolutionize absolutely everything and so uh my partner chase and i basically went all in on ethereum nice but now fast forward to the current era your project holds ethereum of course but then also the second largest holding is trx so how did you like learn about tron and meet justin what''s the story there well i mean i think everybody in crypto knows about tron i mean it''s like you''d have to be living under a rock to know about not know about tron right i think uh you guys are the largest um stable coin minting chain of all time right i think there''s more stable coins that exist on tron than anywhere else yes how much do you guys have now like 60 billion dollars yeah 62 billion 62 62 billion that''s a lot of stable coins so it''s really hard to not know about justin like even when i you know first got into crypto like i already respected justin as an og of the space you know probably probably one of the most influential people in the entire crypto sphere um so i mean i''ve known about justin for very very very long time yeah then how did you meet zach like what''s your story here yeah so so basically uh i love the project you know world liberty five i think it''s a great project focusing on bridge traditional finance with the crypto world um and that''s what we need right since in the last like five years i think the whole industry has spent so much time like energy on uh building the crypto to mainstream so that''s why when i first like heard about the project i i think it makes sense so um so we collaborate like very quickly right and and and until now yeah i think it''s gonna go well cool cool so you guys had an ico zach uh last year and some people called that a failure of an ico but you had no vcs behind you it was all organic that''s right was it a failure so i guess it depends on who you ask uh you know when we were launching this project it was a very heated time let''s say and there was a lot of scrutiny on our project due to you know who''s involved right and so we felt very confident and not just us our attorneys felt very confident that our governance token is a governance token it''s a utility token the sole utility of the token is governance right and that governance was live on day one but for us the token sale was never really the goal of the project the goal of the project is as justin alluded to being able to create products that actually merge the traditional financial institution with decentralized finance and we''re doing that through a whole range of products and applications that we''re actually developing and we''re going to be shipping so for us the whole idea was you know if this token sale doesn''t go well it doesn''t really matter to us for us it''s a means to market the project get awareness and distribute governance throughout the crypto community so when we were looking at this we were like what''s the worst possible outcome and the worst possible outcome was getting caught up in all of this lawfare and being you know political collateral right so we decided that even though our attorneys and everyone felt very comfortable that this was a utility token why don''t we go ahead and just you know register and go with the reg d reg s offering kyc accredited investors inside the united states and just take a belts and suspenders approach because whether the token like sale is successful or not we don''t want to get caught up debating whether this is a security not a security etc because the previous administration as everybody knows was very i wouldn''t even say unfriendly they were anti-crypto so we didn''t want to get caught up in a situation where you know these amazing products and partnerships that we''ve been working so hard to put together and really move the industry forward comes to a screeching halt before we even come out the gates for sure because you know back then it was so complex where the sec was going after everyone unfairly unfairly right but times have changed in the u.s with the trump administration they''ve taken a very proactive approach sure you guys you''re a big beneficiary of that yeah so back to whether or not it was a success or a failure i think because we didn''t have that vc uh you know capital behind us on day one um i also think that people were a little nervous to get involved with holding the token and buying the token um before the november 5th results were in because people didn''t know what was actually going to happen and what the landscape was going to be so we set out to sell 300 million dollars of our token um which was 20 of the supply at a 1.5 billion valuation we heard everything from it''s too high the valuation''s too high to you know you well what''s the point of doing this before november 5th whatever it is we heard it all but this guy right here saw what very few people saw which is regardless of the outcome this project itself is a monumental move forward for crypto and the entire industry in the community so once everything kind of fell in place and we got the support of justin and he came in and purchased a bunch of tokens in the public sale everything kind of snowballed from there and then not only did we sell the initial 300 million uh worth of tokens that we had set out to sell we opened an additional five percent at a five billion dollar valuation and that''s almost sold out right now so that''s going to sell out very shortly i would i would assume and uh when we do that we will be the fourth largest ico of all time and we managed to do that with no vc backing no special treatment to anybody who purchased the token and we did it with complete kyc and us accreditation in place yeah by by the rules by the book so even more even more than by the book there is a rumor out there that there was a deal with some companies for token swaps where they would pay and get a fee in response for promotion and that kind of stuff is that true or is that i''ve seen that going around uh the person who was going out and purporting to represent us is not connected with our company okay we never sent them out to do that we found out about it and it obviously caused confusion but no we haven''t done any token swaps um to date oh and if you and to be honest the funny thing is because i''ve seen articles about it if you look on chain all of the tokens we hold whether it''s tron or wrapped bitcoin ethereum chain link ave etc we bought on chain through a dex so it''s you know i guess that''s the beauty of blockchain it''s all transparent where you can see this on the record on the ledger and you can just say don''t believe my word for it you know check out on chain yeah very cool so moving over to tron so justin like tron right now was a big success story of last year trx is up like 75 percent beat solana beat ethereum like why is that like why is it doing so well yes sure totally um so first of all i think we focus so we have been focused quite long on stable coin development uh currently uh we are almost the number one uh stable coin network in terms of like transaction volume i think soon will be the the holding protocol for most of the stable coins and also um by doing that we are also focusing on d5 we build a justland protocol recently we launched a decentralized stable coin called usdd which is also um reach around 200 million dollars tvl and also of course we support our world liberty five we try to grow and the bridge the decentralized finance finance with uh the traditional finance all together um and also of course i think we also pay some attention to uh memes um nft developments and what happen uh in the crypto space like every day uh and also i want to chime in a little bit about the tokenomics on tron is also important actually tron is the only uh deflationary token among all the top 10 uh major crypto currency um bitcoin of course we know uh it''s cut uh supply like every four years um by half uh but still bitcoin is uh inflation crypto uh and ethereum you know um um um probably be deflation for one or two days but most of the time is still uh inflation token uh if we look at like solana and other token the inflation rate is even way higher it''s like 12 15 15 something uh tron is the only crypto if you check on the browser browser is is transparent there um it''s two three percent uh deflationary every year so um a wild reason um is because of the network activities like everybody use it just like ethereum eip 1559 you know people bring the serum for the transaction so that''s why the overall the network is well very healthy, you know, it''s more demand rather than the supply and the people use it. And if you see the trunk K line, you will see especially for monthly K line. So you will see it''s growing like basically every month. I think with a good rate rather than I don''t like crypto, you know, to pump up like 10x, you know, today and 90% tomorrow, I think a stable growth, right? It''s what everybody wants. That''s also what you see what happened on Bitcoin. So that''s also my vision for TRX. We want to do it like gradually, successful in the long run. Very cool. So you''re right now at 64 billion of stable coins issued on chain. Yes. Where''s the demand coming from? Like why are people using Tron for stable coins and not say Ethereum or Solana or what have you? Yes, totally. So first of all, I think Tron has become the default stable coin payment network for everybody. I think we have seen at least one to two billion dollars increase like every month on Tron about the supply of USDT. Actually, lots of people are seeing Tron basically as the default platform for stable transaction. For some of them get into the Tron protocol, have no idea about Ethereum, like Solana, even crypto in the first place. They just get the crypto payment, get stable coin payment. They thought it''s just US dollar payment. So that''s also something I think I''m proud of. You know, we create this kind of the user experience. People don''t need to get to know about stable coin, get to know about Tether, get to know about Tron in the first place before they even using them. Yeah. Yeah, because, you know, if we want to evolve cryptocurrency, we have to get away from the very complex technology, right? Yes. The wallets, you know, people are nervous when they send a thousand USDT to do some long address. Yes. So I guess we have to work to like break down these barriers and make this UI UX boomer friendly, perhaps. Exactly. Yes. Yes. Grand-grandma friendly too. Grandma friendly. Yeah. All right. So like in the last few months, the US has changed a lot for crypto, where it used to be that Asia was the place you wanted to go to for crypto because they have a rule book here in Hong Kong and Singapore, wherever. But now the US is changing. Are you guys optimistic about the US? Do you see it as like the future home of all things crypto? Or is it like a multipolar world where you have multiple jurisdictions for crypto? Yes. For myself, I totally bullish on the regulation in the United States. I think like everything changed dramatically since last year. And we have seen lots of positive developments, I think, happening in the United States. Lots of crypto companies is moving back, you know, have their new branches in the United States. And also we have seen, right, our US has collaborated with Hong Kong, you know, on this kind of the crypto development. I think consensus, Coindesk is a great example. I think a year ago when I attended the Hong Kong, you know, crypto festival, I predicted it''s going to be more international. We will see more international collaboration because at that time, Hong Kong crypto festival is more like native, you know, Asia-based, Chinese-based crypto festival. But this year, right, look at what we have developed, you know, everybody in the world have come to Hong Kong, you know, for the crypto conference. I think it''s going to keep going. Like, and Hong Kong will be the center of the crypto in Asia, too. Okay, you think so? Zach, what do you think? Do you feel like pride where you can build at home without being worried about attorneys and the SEC and that kind of stuff? Well, I don''t think it''s that you don''t have to worry about it. I think that what everybody in crypto has been asking for are just clear rules and regulations. So the thing is, is that it''s very difficult to build a business when you don''t understand what the rules and regulations are. Yeah. So I think what most people, most founders and most people in the community want to see is just a clearly defined set of rules and regulations that every single project can set out and know, okay, here''s what we''re allowed to do, here''s what we''re not allowed to do. Whereas in the past, what it''s been is even companies that are taking extra safe precautions are still being treated as if they''re doing something wrong, because there''s no clarity and there''s no guidelines or framework as to what actually is right and wrong. So I think that or I''m hopeful that we''re going to start to get some of that and it becomes a place where founders and companies don''t feel the need to move offshore, don''t feel the need to go elsewhere and we can bring crypto back to the United States and make it, you know, the crypto capital of the planet. And we''ve already started to see that a lot of companies that have U.S. founders, like Justin was saying, are already starting to come back to the U.S. and be proud of the fact that they''re U.S. based. For sure. Do you have like a wish list for crypto rules to change in the U.S., Zach or Justin? Like what do you want to see change the most? Like do you have, you know, the top three things you want to see happen? Yeah, I hope, you know, next like consensus event in New York, because I start to attend consensus event in New York, you know, back like in 2018. So it''s seven years now. I think for my top wish list, I can attend the consensus in New York, probably in 10 year anniversary. We''ll have Justin sign the keynote when we''re back in the U.S. speaking there. Yes, yes. So going back to stable coins for a second, you know, there is a belief that Tron''s a network of trouble for stable coins, you know, the bad stuff, drugs, guns, all that nonsense. Yes. But you guys have worked close with Tether and TRM Labs to build out a unit to like fight bad action and fight crime. Can you talk about that? Because we reported actually in CoinDesk that you guys hit $100 million of frozen funds with this group. Yes, totally. We are very open to the global law enforcement regulators to combat illicit activities. Actually, we are also one of the best in this area. I won''t mention the competitor names, but actually we phrase most of the illicit funds. I think we''ve seen a few hours. It''s got reported by other police, which is it''s the golden time. It is important because the first 12 hours is the most like precious time. But the competitor got six months to react in any way. So that''s why I think we have like a very robust team, which we''re going to talk about that. I think in the next panel, we have the best data analysis company in the world, best stablecoin protocol company in the world. We guarantee, you know, the stablecoin and the crypto technology will only be used for the legal activities. So that''s why I think we also get lots of like thank you letters from all government authorities around the world. So and they kind of like impressed by our reaction and the whole structure and put on the great help on their operations. So that''s something I''m proud of and we will continue to invest and even build more team on that. I think we are not only going to prove we are the number one in the regulation or for the authority in crypto world, but also we want to make law enforcement authorities believe we are actually doing better job for standard charter, you know, HSBC, those big traditional banks. Yeah, because like it''s one thing for us to talk about crypto and on-chain data, but to get like some judge or some cop to understand how this whole thing works. That''s the missing key, which you guys, I think, are doing quite well with TRM Labs. Yes, yes, totally. For lots of government authorities, it''s hard for them to understand crypto in the first place. And then when they find out something goes wrong, the money is in the hands of the bad actor. So so that''s why we we want to shorten those time period. Right. To to make sure the money gets back. Right. And and and and the authority get educated and they will next time that they will do it faster, you know, to make sure crypto is the same with in terms of, you know, safety, in terms of the regulation friendly, similar to the banks. So that''s also like a very important. I think what we do here and the collaborate with the law enforcement like globally to make sure it happen. Do you think that''s the biggest barrier to adoption is that law enforcement still doesn''t trust crypto? Like, is there other things as well for that? Yeah. Yeah. Besides user experience. Right. Definitely. I believe this is also one of the key here. Right. Hopefully, like one day we will see, you know, US government even trust their money with cryptocurrency. Right. Right now, I think they only have cryptocurrency because they confiscated from like other bad actors. Right. But US government didn''t really pull their own money into cryptocurrency more. I think other government, I think, have a similar situation. But we want to make sure it is safe, user experience, easy to understand. And eventually government can trust crypto with their own money. Right. So you think one day we''ll have the Fed owning Bitcoin alongside dollars and gold maybe? Yeah. Yeah. Totally. Exactly. What do you think? We have that reserve of Bitcoin in the US? I mean, it sounds good to me. Yeah. It sounds good to me. Okay. So one of the big themes, you know, this year has been, you know, meme tokens, right? We have meme tokens about politics, about jokes, all that kind of stuff. Do you think, do you guys think that memes are like the future of crypto or are they like one part of the broader ecosystem? Yeah, sure. I definitely believe meme is the future of crypto. But I recently, right, we have seen, right, some like meme token has go down like dramatically. I think one of the reason is you need to do meme token in the right way. Right. So we cannot do like meme token like PVP, you know, like a rug pool, you know, the crypto trading. You know, the crypto traders back then, you know, for example, today, you know, you''ve seen some of the meme coin launch on the platform. It''s got like super high valuation at first when they launch, you know, price go down. You know, it''s just similar to like VC coins. Right. So back then, you know, when I first know about PEEP, you know, like Shiba, you know, like, like Dogecoin. It is trading by the community for quite a long time. And without like anyone take it like seriously in the first place. I remember like when I buy like Dogecoin in the exchange and in the Reddit, I saw those Reddit posts, you know, like Dogecoin. First of all, the value is almost zero and nobody take it seriously. Right. I think that''s the best way, you know, to launch a meme coin. You know, today, I think lots of meme coins try to make the investor on the day one to believe, oh, this is something way more than meme coin. It''s not just a joke. It''s something big like Bitcoin. Right. I think actually they are doing the opposite. Right. Because when I find out the best meme coin of all time when they first launch, people see it as a joke. And then after that, for quite a long time, people find out, oh, it''s actually more than a joke. Yeah. And something else, you know, this is kind of when I see the best meme coin in the world, like how it evolves, you know, how it get famous. Rather than like most of the meme coin we''ve seen in the market today, you know, high market cap launch and then, you know, go zero. Like everybody lose their confidence on the token. That''s also a problem with VC tokens because the VC comes in, they pump it up and then they dump it all over. And then they dump it on retail. And for World Liberty, you guys ignored VCs pretty much. You went just with, you know, investors. Well, no, to be fair, VCs ignored us. And so we took a very anti-VC approach when we realized that they wanted nothing to do with us. And we realized that we want nothing to do with them. And it actually led to a much better result because what turned out was basically a fair launch, right? Yeah. Where every single person there''s. So I''m sure that there are VCs that purchased, but they did it through the public sale. Sure. And I don''t know who they are, but I''m sure they exist, right? There''s only one VC fund that I know that purchased it and they purchased it at the 1.5 billion valuation and then came back and bought more at the 5 billion valuation. Yeah. They bought sizable amounts at both. Okay. So they, they didn''t get a discount. They didn''t even ask for a discount. And so in my mind, the problem with VCs are not that they don''t have a place in the industry, but it''s that the majority of them are predatory. Okay. They want to come in, they want to get something for less than anybody else can get it for. And then they want to use the public and retail as exit liquidity so that they can make their money and move on to the next thing. And that''s just not what crypto is about. Crypto is about giving everybody access to the same information, the same opportunities, et cetera. And if you''re going to allow a VC to come in and get something that''s not available to anybody else, it''s almost very anti-crypto in my opinion. Sure. So why do you think that VCs ignored you? Was it the Trump connection or something else or what? I think a lot of them didn''t like, weren''t willing to do what Justin did, which was take a risk. Yeah. You know, I mean, they don''t want it. The funny thing is like, you think about a VC and you think, oh, they risk capital, but they really don''t. That''s the exact opposite, right? Like VCs are not out there like, you know, taking any risks. What they want to do is they want to engineer everything so that they win. And even if it''s at the expense of somebody else. And then you change them to Etsy, right? Like venture capital become secure capital. Right. You think that with venture capital, they would expect some losses and some risk, but it seems like they want a safe investment like a real estate in some way. They want a guaranteed 10 X, you know, or like, and it''s just, that''s not what crypto is about. Yeah. It seems like also a way for people to lose confidence in crypto. If they think that some elite in Wall Street will just, you know, rig the whole mechanism. Well, they''re not wrong. That''s what''s happened for a long time. And so, you know, our whole thing is like, we want to make ICOs great again. You know, like I remember back in the day, like ICOs were good. People were able to get involved in projects and, you know, everyone had access to the same thing. And that''s just not what we''ve seen in the last few years. I think actually if you were to have to bought the top ICO tokens during the boom era of 2017, right now you''d be up a lot. Right. You would have beat everyone else on that. But ICOs were like the bad thing for the markets. Yeah. Well, I think also part of that was because there wasn''t a lot of regulation and, you know, people were making promises that they shouldn''t have been making and stuff like that. So, again, that was a big piece of what we did at World Liberty was make sure that not only did we feel like we fit into the existing regulatory framework, but we took a belts and suspenders approach by going even further. And, you know, one of the criticisms that we got, especially in the U.S. from investors or retail, was like, oh, this is only for the elites because I''m not an accredited investor. I don''t meet the standard I can''t buy. And it''s like, well, if you think about it, that''s not to keep people from not having an opportunity. It''s to keep people from taking undue risk that they can''t take the burden of. And you see that going back to your previous question about meme coins, how many people are on Twitter right now complaining that they lost their life savings on a meme coin that got rugged? It''s like, look, you know, I''m not going to give someone financial advice, but I think it''s pretty stupid to risk your entire life savings on a meme coin. Right. So that''s why I think that what we did, like, while it seems a little restrictive at the same time, it''s actually in the benefit of the entire population in general. That''s what the SEC is there for is to protect investors. And there is a point to some rules where you don''t want a laissez-faire environment. You want some rules, but smart rules. Exactly. Fair rules that make sense by people that understand the industry and then apply those rules and regulations uniformly to everybody. That''s what''s important. Okay, for sure. To wrap things up. So what''s next for you guys? What''s your plan for this year? Yeah. So as we move away from the token sale and we conclude that, the next thing is to start focusing on what the true goal of World Liberty Financial is, which is to build products that actually bridge traditional finance with decentralized finance. And so you''re going to see all of the projects and all of the products that we''ve actually been working very hard on behind the scenes start to come out over the next few weeks in the next few months. And I think everybody who took a wait and see approach is going to be very unhappy that they didn''t support from day one. Okay. Good to know. Justin, what about you guys? What''s next for you? Yeah, we launched USDD a few weeks ago. It''s grown to $200 million. I''m sorry, $200 million. I speak for my dream members. That would be a massive table coin if it was that one. Yes. So $200 million. You know, we will continue to build that. I think our target will be double the market cap, I think, very soon. We want to collaborate with all the exchanges. Right now we provide like very high yield, I think around 20%. We will close monitor on that, you know, to see like how it benefits our community. And also besides that, I think this year we also have an AI product we''re going to launch very soon. You know, it''s a deep seek base, you know, large language mode. We will launch like quite soon. I think in Q2 or something as well. Share more about that right now? Yeah, sure. Totally. So we just, because right now the AI mode has become transparency, you know, and everybody can check the call. You know, build on that. It''s actually kind of like remind me of something back to ISO stage. You know, I ever seen start to become like open source. You know, you can, you can check on them develop on your own, you know. Yeah. Everybody can have it on blockchain, you know, at that time. Yeah, I think AI have similar effects. So that''s why we are launching AI protocol. I think powered by Tron protocol as well. You know, you can basically pay with stable coin on Tron network to get your own AI mode. I think that''s something we''re going to launch like very soon. I still believe AI block plus blockchain. The combination will be very powerful. Okay. So that''s your big focus for this next coming year. AI plus blockchain. Yes. Yes. Totally. Very cool. Well, guys, that was great. Thanks for your time. Of course. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you everybody.', 'all right we got a full house for justin''s son so look we all know justin''s son he''s like the star of hong kong crypto but we don''t know this guy right here zach who came all the way from the us to talk to us in hong kong so zach tell us about your crypto origin story and how you came about with world of the foundation and all that good stuff yeah so uh in terms of how i got into crypto i guess we kind of have to take it back before crypto um i went to law school and very quickly i realized i didn''t want to be a lawyer good call yeah probably like within the first year or two i knew i didn''t want to be a lawyer but i mean it was a great experience i learned a lot and uh was really interested in particularly in like real estate contract law stuff like that um and when i came out of law school i actually uh with my partner chase hero founded a digital advertising and customer acquisition business um we focused on marketing customer acquisition product sales and it was about 2016 when a really good friend of mine who''s you know very much in the crypto space uh told me that i needed to read the ethereum white paper now prior to that i already knew about crypto because uh i had a lot of friends that were poker players and they used bitcoin to settle poker transactions um but like i''m not a big poker player myself so i didn''t see the vision of like bitcoin as you know going to revolutionize the global uh financial system you know i didn''t have that early vision and because i wasn''t a poker player i didn''t really dive into bitcoin it just wasn''t that interesting but when i read the ethereum white paper and understood the power of being able to do business with people around the world in a trustless manner where two parties can work together without having to see each other face to face and best of all eliminate the attorneys yeah you know i we work with a lot of lawyers so you know don''t get me wrong they''re great people but uh i realized that this was going to revolutionize absolutely everything and so uh my partner chase and i basically went all in on ethereum nice but now fast forward to the current era your project holds ethereum of course but then also the second largest holding is trx so how did you like learn about tron and meet justin what''s the story there well i mean i think everybody in crypto knows about tron i mean it''s like you''d have to be living under a rock to know about not know about tron right i think uh you guys are the largest um stable coin minting chain of all time right i think there''s more stable coins that exist on tron than anywhere else yes how much do you guys have now like 60 billion dollars yeah 62 billion 62 62 billion that''s a lot of stable coins so it''s really hard to not know about justin like even when i you know first got into crypto like i already respected justin as an og of the space you know probably probably one of the most influential people in the entire crypto sphere um so i mean i''ve known about justin for very very very long time yeah then how did you meet zach like what''s your story here yeah so so basically uh i love the project you know world liberty five i think it''s a great project focusing on bridge traditional finance with the crypto world um and that''s what we need right since in the last like five years i think the whole industry has spent so much time like energy on uh building the crypto to mainstream so that''s why when i first like heard about the project i i think it makes sense so um so we collaborate like very quickly right and and and until now yeah i think it''s gonna go well cool cool so you guys had an ico zach uh last year and some people called that a failure of an ico but you had no vcs behind you it was all organic that''s right was it a failure so i guess it depends on who you ask uh you know when we were launching this project it was a very heated time let''s say and there was a lot of scrutiny on our project due to you know who''s involved right and so we felt very confident and not just us our attorneys felt very confident that our governance token is a governance token it''s a utility token the sole utility of the token is governance right and that governance was live on day one but for us the token sale was never really the goal of the project the goal of the project is as justin alluded to being able to create products that actually merge the traditional financial institution with decentralized finance and we''re doing that through a whole range of products and applications that we''re actually developing and we''re going to be shipping so for us the whole idea was you know if this token sale doesn''t go well it doesn''t really matter to us for us it''s a means to market the project get awareness and distribute governance throughout the crypto community so when we were looking at this we were like what''s the worst possible outcome and the worst possible outcome was getting caught up in all of this lawfare and being you know political collateral right so we decided that even though our attorneys and everyone felt very comfortable that this was a utility token why don''t we go ahead and just you know register and go with the reg d reg s offering kyc accredited investors inside the united states and just take a belts and suspenders approach because whether the token like sale is successful or not we don''t want to get caught up debating whether this is a security not a security etc because the previous administration as everybody knows was very i wouldn''t even say unfriendly they were anti-crypto so we didn''t want to get caught up in a situation where you know these amazing products and partnerships that we''ve been working so hard to put together and really move the industry forward comes to a screeching halt before we even come out the gates for sure because you know back then it was so complex where the sec was going after everyone unfairly unfairly right but times have changed in the u.s with the trump administration they''ve taken a very proactive approach sure you guys you''re a big beneficiary of that yeah so back to whether or not it was a success or a failure i think because we didn''t have that vc uh you know capital behind us on day one um i also think that people were a little nervous to get involved with holding the token and buying the token um before the november 5th results were in because people didn''t know what was actually going to happen and what the landscape was going to be so we set out to sell 300 million dollars of our token um which was 20 of the supply at a 1.5 billion valuation we heard everything from it''s too high the valuation''s too high to you know you well what''s the point of doing this before november 5th whatever it is we heard it all but this guy right here saw what very few people saw which is regardless of the outcome this project itself is a monumental move forward for crypto and the entire industry in the community so once everything kind of fell in place and we got the support of justin and he came in and purchased a bunch of tokens in the public sale everything kind of snowballed from there and then not only did we sell the initial 300 million uh worth of tokens that we had set out to sell we opened an additional five percent at a five billion dollar valuation and that''s almost sold out right now so that''s going to sell out very shortly i would i would assume and uh when we do that we will be the fourth largest ico of all time and we managed to do that with no vc backing no special treatment to anybody who purchased the token and we did it with complete kyc and us accreditation in place yeah by by the rules by the book so even more even more than by the book there is a rumor out there that there was a deal with some companies for token swaps where they would pay and get a fee in response for promotion and that kind of stuff is that true or is that i''ve seen that going around uh the person who was going out and purporting to represent us is not connected with our company okay we never sent them out to do that we found out about it and it obviously caused confusion but no we haven''t done any token swaps um to date oh and if you and to be honest the funny thing is because i''ve seen articles about it if you look on chain all of the tokens we hold whether it''s tron or wrapped bitcoin ethereum chain link ave etc we bought on chain through a dex so it''s you know i guess that''s the beauty of blockchain it''s all transparent where you can see this on the record on the ledger and you can just say don''t believe my word for it you know check out on chain yeah very cool so moving over to tron so justin like tron right now was a big success story of last year trx is up like 75 percent beat solana beat ethereum like why is that like why is it doing so well yes sure totally um so first of all i think we focus so we have been focused quite long on stable coin development uh currently uh we are almost the number one uh stable coin network in terms of like transaction volume i think soon will be the the holding protocol for most of the stable coins and also um by doing that we are also focusing on d5 we build a justland protocol recently we launched a decentralized stable coin called usdd which is also um reach around 200 million dollars tvl and also of course we support our world liberty five we try to grow and the bridge the decentralized finance finance with uh the traditional finance all together um and also of course i think we also pay some attention to uh memes um nft developments and what happen uh in the crypto space like every day uh and also i want to chime in a little bit about the tokenomics on tron is also important actually tron is the only uh deflationary token among all the top 10 uh major crypto currency um bitcoin of course we know uh it''s cut uh supply like every four years um by half uh but still bitcoin is uh inflation crypto uh and ethereum you know um um um probably be deflation for one or two days but most of the time is still uh inflation token uh if we look at like solana and other token the inflation rate is even way higher it''s like 12 15 15 something uh tron is the only crypto if you check on the browser browser is is transparent there um it''s two three percent uh deflationary every year so um a wild reason um is because of the network activities like everybody use it just like ethereum eip 1559 you know people bring the serum for the transaction so that''s why the overall the network is well very healthy, you know, it''s more demand rather than the supply and the people use it. And if you see the trunk K line, you will see especially for monthly K line', '["all right we got a full house for justin''s son so look we all know justin''s son he''s like the star of hong kong

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('usdc_as_a_platform_for_global_prosperity', 'USDC as a Platform for Global Prosperity', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' All right. Good to see everyone. It''s always good to be back in Hong Kong as someone who was born here, spent quite a bit of time here. And I also want to give a shout-out to ConsenSys, to Coindesk, to Bullish for putting this together and putting ConsenSys here in Hong Kong. It''s a really terrific event. So I''m going to give you the punchline. The first punchline is 56 billion. 56 billion is currently the market cap of USDC. It is an all-time high that we hit about a week or so ago, and it''s what everyone seems to be talking about. But 56 billion masks what is really happening behind the scenes with USDC, with stablecoins, and with the partners that we''ve been working with all around the world, including the ones here in Hong Kong. 56 billion is just the total market capitalization of USDC globally. But did you know that there are now over $23 trillion worth of on-chain transaction that''s been done using USDC? This is different from where we were two, three years ago in the last cycle. USDC is also on more chains than ever. We''re now on 18 chains globally, and we''re being used across 100-plus countries around the world. Today, there are nearly 4 million wallets around the world that actually hold and use USDC. So 56 billion tends to be what people think about, but to build a real stablecoin business, it''s about all the other aspects, the other metrics that we think about every day as a team. Now, what makes 56 billion possible? USDC is a digital dollar on the Internet, and there are two important aspects about it. The first aspect, it''s around dollar stability. And first and foremost, I want to know, and as you probably know, that we are the largest regulated dollar in the world. We''re regulated by regulators in the U.S., in Singapore, in Europe, and soon other places as well. We are backed one-to-one with reserves that are being held in institutions like BlackRock, as well as financial institutions, GSIPS, around the world. That gives our users, our developers, the trust that they need when they use USDC. The other piece is probably the most obvious to most folks here in this room, because you''re here at ConsenSys, and that''s the blockchain efficiency. And that''s the ability to have dollars that settle 24-7 at near instant rates. There are fewer intermediaries that move between you and who you''re sending your money to, and there''ll be lower costs when you send that money. These two together is actually what makes USDC unique. Another way to think about it is that we''re building the payments protocol for the Internet. And as we think about that, this is really not just a conversation around USDC. This is really a conversation on a broader stablecoin network. Many people actually come up to us and ask, why don''t you launch Hong Kong dollar stablecoin or XYZ stablecoin? Stablecoins in various different currencies. Now, we believe that the world eventually will move in that direction. We specialize in the largest regulated dollar stablecoin, and we also issue the euro stablecoin, EURC. But what we expect to see is actually many more stablecoins in different denominations to pop up all around the world. And we expect all of these stablecoins to be built up to the right standards and be able to operate on open blockchains permissionlessly. And that''s actually the future of what the stablecoin network will look like. One common question that I get, and many of you probably get, is what are stablecoins used for? We actually heard some of it throughout the day from the panelists earlier, which is terrific. But I do want to just highlight a couple of buckets where USDC is being used. And I put them in general in three large buckets. The first one is around digital assets and the capital markets around that. The second piece is consumer payment solutions. And then the third piece is around cross-border payments. And let me dive into a couple of those and then do a little case study around the cross-border payments piece. On the digital asset side, this is where most of the stablecoin adoption started, where on the digital trading, there was a need for settlement 24-7. As traders, market makers, others, needed to be able to get in and out of positions, whether it''s Bitcoin, Ethereum, Sol, or other type of various tokens. They needed a way to settle those trades real time and immediately. So stablecoin was actually born out of that. And there, we''re working with a number of partners. A couple of those are highlighted. That includes Binance, DRW, Bison Digital, and there are many, many others as well, where we''re working with them to enable the usage of USDC to help them as well as their partners to be able to settle and trade with USDC. The second bucket is actually quite interesting. The second bucket is probably where most of you didn''t think existed or people who are not in the industry didn''t think existed. And there, we actually have many different examples. Some of these Hong Kong-based companies that are using Web3 solutions to go through their digital transformation and move to the next phase of finance. These are companies like Hong Kong Telecom, REAP, these are companies all based here, as well as global companies like MasterCard, Visa, that are using USDC for settlement within their network. And then we have companies in more emerging markets, such as Nubank or Grab, that are using our Web3-related services and are using USDC as a way to provide dollar savings, dollar holdings for their users. Most recently, we also announced a partnership in the Middle East with Lulu, and we''re looking forward to working with them to enable USDC use through their users. But what we''ve seen in all of these use cases is that these are companies who are either telcos or Web2 wallets, fintechs in the last generation, that are actually upgrading and moving to the next phase. And they''re doing this both through various Web3 services, technologies that enable them to build on blockchains, as well as use stablecoins on their network. And most people focus on the first piece, or the last piece, which is the use of USDC, but they forget that many of these corporates, large enterprises, need help to actually get to that next phase. They need technology solutions, they need consultants, they need builders to be able to help make that transition. For some of the folks in the room, you''re familiar of building on blockchains. For some of these enterprises, it''s actually quite hard. They do not have the talent, they don''t have the controls in place, they may not have compliance built in in the first place. So what we''re doing is actually providing some technology services that help these companies make that transition. We help abstract away some of those blockchain complexities on how you build, how you get to finality, how you think of compliance, how you address travel rule, all of those things that are really important in the movement of value, we abstract that into APIs that these companies in the middle are using. And they''re building this for millions of users around the world. Lastly, I want to talk about cross-border payments. This is probably one of the most exciting parts for the use of stablecoin. I''m going to start with MoneyGram because MoneyGram is an old school business. You wouldn''t think an old remittance company would be moving and using stablecoins. But they are, and they''re actually doing this in places that are probably the highest impact. We have a partnership with MoneyGram, together with Stellar, and the UNHCR, the UN High Commission on Refugees, that actually provides aid, dollars, to Ukrainian refugees that are going through the war there. And they''re able to receive aid directly from the UN and be able to send and use those money on the network, on Stellar, and then be able to off-ramp at any MoneyGram location around the world. They can show up at a MoneyGram in Ukraine. They can show up at a MoneyGram in France. They can show up at a MoneyGram here in Hong Kong and be able to convert the USDC into local currency and be able to spend it in real world. And that''s actually really important. Second piece, and I don''t need to dive into this, is Stripe. Everyone has been talking about the Stripe acquisition of Bridge that was really the shot heard around the world around the use of stablecoin to help companies like Stripe, but really their partners, their merchants, to be able to accept payments anywhere in the world with USDC, with stablecoin, and then be able to send it and pay out to all of their merchants around the world that depend on that money for working capital and to pay their suppliers and to be able to pay for goods. Lastly, I want to dive into Tunes. We announced a partnership with Tunes last October, so just a couple months ago, which I believe was quite transformative in thinking about and having a great use case of how USDC and stablecoins are being used to enable faster commerce and faster payments. Tunes is a B2B company that moves money for many of the remittance companies around the world as well as payment companies around the world. Their network includes Grab, Deliveroo, it includes Remitly, MoneyGram, Western Union. You don''t hear about them because they work on the background, but what they provide is the ability to do instant payouts all around the world across 100-some countries, dollars or local fiats into whatever the local payment form would be, directly into bank accounts or into wallets that are being used like GCash by local users. They came to us with a question. They are providing a lot of this through pre-funding at the edge of the network and on weekends in particular, but really throughout the week, it''s really hard to move money from the west to the east. Every day, they have to think about and plan their timing to move funds in New York with a large bank that have been debanking some of the crypto companies that are coming back, but you know who it is. They have to move money there by 4 or 4.30 in order for it to get to Asia T plus 2, two days later. And that''s a particular problem on weekends where when they move money on a Friday, it''s already Saturday in Asia. And that money actually doesn''t arrive until Monday at the soonest, if not Tuesday. And all of that is actually working capital costs for them and or for their partners. They''re also moving money from around the world over to Africa. And that settlement time can go up to T plus 5. So what they did is they came to us and they said, hey, there''s this thing called stable coin. You can settle immediately. Why don''t we use it in our treasury to be able to move funds around the world? So that was exactly the partnership. They''re now using USDC and settling millions of dollars a day using USDC all around the world to many of the emerging markets in Southeast Asia as well as markets in Africa and other places. But they went a step further. They realized that for some of the payers into the system, they were having pre-funding problems. So now they''re talking with a lot of companies who have started to turn on to fund them using USDC. So we now have two sides of the lake where the payers are minting USDC in the US or in Europe, be able to send it directly to them and then they''re able to move that money over to Asia near instant and then be able to pay out in local fiat wherever they are. This 24-7 settlement is really changing how they''re operating, how efficient they can be, lowering their capital costs. More importantly, it''s increasing some of the quality of service for the end customers, especially those in emerging markets. What''s ahead? First and foremost, as the last panel had talked about, regulations are changing. It''s impossible in the last couple months to talk about regulation without what''s going on in the US. And for those of you who have been watching, now there are bills in Congress around stable coins explicitly. And if the AI and crypto czar manages to deliver on the promise, there should be a stable coin bill before the president''s desk within the first 100 days of the administration. That will set probably a pretty clear standard in terms of what a well-regulated stable coin would look like. And it''s going to have a great impact not just in the United States, but really around the world. The US is actually behind here. Some of the other jurisdictions have been implementing or working through regulations. In Europe, they''ve been working on something called Mika, which came into effect actually in July 1st, 2024. Circle was the first global issuer that was able to come into compliance with Mika and were able to issue both USDC as well as EURC, our Eurostable coin, in that framework. And many of the virtual asset providers, or they call them crypto asset service providers, came into compliance at the end of last year. We started seeing exchanges delisting stable coins that were not Mika compliant and moving their treasury and other things into compliant stable coins. And that''s the direction that we expect to see. We heard earlier, a couple panels ago, the CEO of Vara. There in the Middle East, there are regulations coming into place as well on stable coins. We actually announced that we''re setting up an office in Abu Dhabi. Closer to home, I''ll start with Japan. Japan has a stable coin law in effect, and the FSA has actually published guidelines for what a well-regulated stable coin will look like. And stay tuned, you''ll be hearing from us soon about what will happen in Japan. And then it''s important to also talk about Hong Kong. Hong Kong is working through its legislation for stable coin. The regulators here actually have a couple months lead time in putting that into place. They''re working hard down the street over at Letchco to work through the details of that stable coin bill. And it''s a terrific bill that actually sets a high standard of what a well-regulated stable coin will look like. And there''s similarities in terms of how they''ve set that up with the U.S. framework and with the Japan framework and with the European framework. So what we''re seeing actually is that you can call it coordination, but at least a matching of high standards all around the world in terms of how stable coins will be regulated and what sort of stable coins will be interoperable across different jurisdictions. And that''s really important as you think about the businesses that you''ll build and the medium of exchange that you''ll be able to use on your network. Last but not least, and I''ll close with this slide, we''re just getting started. Those use cases that I talked about are the ones that we''re seeing today. As regulation come into place, as the enterprises build their Web3 wallets, build their platforms, we expect to see more settlement and more transactions happening on-chain. This will include companies that are either small, medium, or large holding their treasuries with stable coins on-chain because it''s faster to move them across jurisdiction than it was with banking. They''re able to then use these stable coins to move into investments as they need and to be able to move out of these investments like tokenized money market funds 24-7. We''re going to see more on-chain payments. We''re just getting started. We have these partners all around the world that are receiving and sending with USDC. As the regulation becomes clear and as more partners come into the network, we''re going to see more of these transactions because it''s faster and cheaper and more dependable. As we see the stable coin network build, we expect more stable coins in different jurisdictions and different currencies. We''re going to see on-chain FX. We''re going to rewrite how foreign exchange will be done. We''re going to see on-chain credit. We''re already talking with companies that are rethinking trade financing that they''re able to underwrite those loans on-chain and to be able to back those loans using USDC and be able to pay back their investors in USDC. All of this is happening and I''m most excited about the work on AI. It''s impossible to not talk about AI. And what''s really interesting about AI is that these agents are getting smarter and smarter by the day. They''re going to be negotiating with one another digitally and oftentimes they''ll have to settle whatever they negotiated in value. And it would be really silly for AI agents to send an email to accounts payable to make a bank payment. Most likely, they''ll be doing that settlement on-chain and they''ll be using stablecoins to do so that are traceable with smart contracts in place and different conditions around it. So I''m super excited for what is to come. I''m super excited to be part of the Open Money Summit. Thank you so much. and pistols. Thank you so much for coming to us. Thank you. Thank you. Okay.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('views_from_wall_street_to_crypto', 'Views from Wall Street to Crypto', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' I''m Tira Gray, Managing Director of CoinDesk Events, and it''s truly a pleasure to welcome you and our very first session, which could not be more appropriate to start the day with, from Wall Street to crypto. We have three esteemed Wall Street veterans joining us today for this opening session. It is my pleasure to welcome them to the stage. Good morning, gentlemen. You can hear me okay? Yes. We''ve been running with our jet lag, and we''re going to try to take this down as articulately as we can under the sleep-deprived circumstances. So you all had a tremendous career on traditional Wall Street before pivoting into crypto, and I thought it would be really fun for the audience to kind of hear what was your aha moment. So Mike, let''s start with you. Lifelong career on global market infrastructure. It makes sense that the market structure potential of crypto would be an obvious opportunity. What was your moment? Where did you see this future? Yeah, it came over time. I think it''s fair to say I saw fragmentation for my entire life. And when you start scaling a proposition in financial markets, you naturally hit boundaries on how you can bring a product, an idea to the next region, to the next markets, and how to embrace the next group of clients. And my pivotal moment was when I really understood the impact of technology on where the planet is going in terms of computational power connectivity, and realizing how important liquidity is in driving sentiment into the right direction and driving adoption. So it came over a few years that I realized, okay, there is a big opportunity, equally slash challenge to get this right. and to really gain a global perspective on how financial markets could look like in the future. Terrific. So I''m going to go to your class. Cajimo Feroilández. in the future. Terrific. Fabio, I''m going to go to you next. You ran Abraxas for, founded Abraxas. 16 years in, you had a moment thinking, wait, we need to pivot to digital assets. How did this happen? Thank you for the question because you know already the answer. For me, instead of over time, it was just one day. One day I was on a plane from Milan to London and I had an EasyJet magazine in front of me. And apologies for what I''m saying, but there was a beautiful picture of a very nice girl actually. And I was looking at the picture and then I saw Ethereum Foundation. So I started to read the article and on that basis actually I got involved in finance. Sorry, finance in crypto. That was my moment. Then as soon as I landed, that afternoon I met a guy that was doing arbitrage on sterling euro between two exchanges. And I was faber-glassed by the spread. I used to be working with less than a basis point spread on the swap market and the guy was talking about percentage points. And that was back in 2017, early 2017. And then, yeah, in the evening I was out for dinner with somebody else. I was involved again in crypto and in the night I couldn''t sleep. So the morning after I started to study the crypto market. So that was my moment. Serendipity played a role, it sounds like. Yes, correct. Gautam, you covered fintech investing your whole career. So I certainly think that that experience lent itself to this, but could you define what was the moment that it all clicked for you? Yeah, sure. So I come from a web to tech investing background prior to getting into crypto. For me, it happened in two stages. Stage one was one of my very close friends wanted to start a company where you start to match resume to people''s profile on LinkedIn, but couldn''t do it and failed because couldn''t access the database of LinkedIn. It was restricted. So when he got into Ethereum, he introduced that concept to me. And I found it very powerful that you can have like open databases to access and then people can build on each other''s work. So that was fascinating. And I think stage two was generally if you look at most of the web two companies, a lot of value accrues based on network effects. So whether it''s Facebook, Google and others. And when I learned about the process of how you transfer ownership to users, and then on the back of it, you build a network. So the power of network effects, I could see it play out in this new tech stack. So that was another kind of aha moment for me. When I combined those two, it was very clear to me that, you know, we need to take technology from just putting lipstick fintech versus really reinventing the tech stack for financial services. And making it, I think it ultimately, we''re not there yet, more accessible for all users. Exactly. And not this esoteric asset class. So let''s go backwards now. I''ll start with you again, Gautam. I would love to know where, let''s start with the positive. What are the frictions in today''s market that we are unanimously agreeing that crypto does solve for? And then we''re going to obviously go to the other side of that. Where is it not succeeded yet? But let''s start with the positive. So I run Brevenhauer Digital, which is a crypto asset management platform. This is a 24-7 asset class. You need to be able to move assets from dollars into crypto and out of that, literally weekends, weekdays, all the time. I think that is a new concept, if you will, for traditional finance. In fact, sometimes we run across this problem where we still have to interact with traditional finance institutions. And sometimes you have trouble on weekends to move from traditional rails to crypto rails, right? So I think that''s kind of a big shift that''s happened with crypto, where it''s 24-7 and accessible to anyone at any point in time. I do agree. The big shift is really like this idea that it never stops. So it''s trading all the time. It is fascinating from a certain point of view. It''s challenging as well. As he was saying, when you have a mismatch, especially if you are involved, like we are involved as well at Abrax and ACACC curve between moving assets from traditional, so the banking system into the crypto and out all the time because our strategy is based on arbitrage. And sometimes it''s quite challenging. It''s quite challenging. So you have to be creative as well and to find ways on accommodating this big difference. But it''s fascinating. When you get involved, you cannot get enough, I have to say. And Mike? Yeah. So moving assets and moving liquidity is music to my market-making ears. So our mission really is in making that a reality. And I think what''s increasingly clear to us is that the asset pool will significantly increase over the next five, ten years. So then we come back to what are the use cases in DeFi and digital assets that really attract and accelerate institutional adoption and then down the road also in retail adoption. And I feel one key element for us as a market maker and liquidity provider is getting this right technologically. And this hopefully creates not just resilience but also trust and confidence. And this is then in my mind the key to the door which you need to make wide open to really bring regulators in big institutional players that trust the system and also understand the benefits of what we claim will be the future coexistence between TreadFi and digital assets and DeFi. And we are not there yet. And we are also not there yet as we are basically embracing a bunch of use cases where question mark could be put on how does that work out from a synergy perspective and how do we want to bring that to the next level. I feel this is also about transparency and alignment. And then next to that I talked about the technological side. If you just embrace the idea that computational power will increase significantly over the next five to ten years, the next five to ten years, then you are a bit back in a big data game because with digitization the planet will earn and get more data and that feeds them back into risk allocation models. And if you believe in it, I think the road into driving better decisions should be there. And what I learned from the TreadFi side is if that is true, then you will have a significant impulse in terms of volume increases. So I''m dreaming a bit about getting this technological layer right, creating interoperability and connectivity and then go from there. It''s amazing to hear big data starting to come back again. I thought that was dead about seven years ago and here we are back to big data. We''ve recreated it in a different shape. We''ve also recreated how risk and return works in this space. And I think this is a really important thing for retail investors to understand and anyone who''s looking this space. We can''t use traditional risk return models, I don''t think. And I''m going to let you guys tell us if that''s the case. But I would like to know specifically what should we be maintaining from traditional finance and how we look at risk and return? And then where should we be shifting to a new lens? What part of the market? So let''s go backwards. Mike, I''ll go back to you. Yeah, so I''m a big supporter of getting risk right. And when I just see how we build our crypto and digital assets business at Flow Traders, we very much focused on building an end-to-end control layer. And what we realized is this is not by taking what you build from an infrastructure perspective on the TreadFi side and just tweaking it a bit. So you just need to go back to a 24-7 mindset. How do you operate markets around the world non-stop? And how do you treat risk internally? And this is not just about risk allocation. It''s really about market risk and counterparty risk and credit risk. So if you put that all together, you just need a very high functioning machine in order to get that right. But once it''s there, right, you embrace really the benefits of digital assets adoption. And that''s a bit the way where I hope the planet will go. Davio? Yeah, I agree. And also I would add, like, for us, when we do arbitrage, the counterparty risk is the most important one. You have to think that whatever is very traditional finance, you can apply, obviously, on the crypto ecosystem. But, you know, because the crypto ecosystem is still an unregulated, you know, bunch of operators and players around, actually, is actually, I mean, the people here are probably all regulated, actually, but the one on the other side are not. So, you know, counterparty risk, credit risk is very, very important. At the same time, you know, like in our business specifically, we really use trust test because there are some idiosyncrasies, idiosyncrasies, actually, cities of a crypto ecosystem, like, that it does not really operate exactly as a traditional finance. Like, the tweet he was talking about, for me, I''ll just make an example, is like, perpetual futures, initial margin. I mean, initial margin in traditional finance, you don''t lose them when you get stopped. In, actually, in crypto market, you do. You lose the variation and the one. So if you''re involved in business trading, this kind of activity, it''s very, very important to, you know, to simulate stress testing scenario, having all the possibilities in front of you, and that is a bit challenging. But, yeah, it can be done. I mean, if you''re done properly, it is quite, it''s quite rewarding, I would say. And Gautam, how do you have to say to that? Look, we, we see risk management as not very dissimilar from traditional finance, in the sense that if you think of the various forms of risk, right, there''s market risk, there''s credit risk, there''s counterparty risk, there''s technology risk. All these risks exist in crypto as well. It''s just the extent is quite different versus traditional finance. So in traditional finance, you don''t think about counterparty risk as much, right? So you''re trading with the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley here, you''re literally pre-funding exchanges. You have to think about exchanges, you know, the risks that associate with, like, putting assets on exchanges. So that''s kind of one risk. The second risk, which is different, is really the technology risk, right? Smart contract risk. So if you''re providing liquidity to liquidity pools, you have to think about those risks. So that''s different. Having said that, there are a lot of principles that we still use from traditional finance, especially as it relates to market risk. So one of the things we focus a lot on structuring trades with a risk reward framework that''s attractive. And the concepts are very similar, right? So you will look for option structures. And to be honest, option markets is pretty deep now, across Bitcoin and ETH especially, right? So use some of those concepts there. In addition to that, you also look at risk reward, even when you invest in early stage projects or so-called venture projects, but they tend to be liquid. So in a way, those are almost like options where you effectively invest at a lower valuation and expect, you know, multiples return, but you can potentially lose half of that. So some of those market risk principles are still applicable even in crypto. Do you feel like that we are creating, I mean, obviously, I know how this solves everything, and it certainly hits on a lot of traditional pain points that we had on Wall Street for many, many years. But it does feel like at times we''re creating a new ecosystem that''s going to come with a whole new vulnerability and it''s not covered enough, particularly I''m thinking for the end user here and the retail investor. To be fair and honest, you''re like, where is the new risk that if you were advising someone new to look at the space who''s investing in it, what is the new risk that we are creating? And it might be solved in the near future. But what is it right now? Look, the biggest shift, if you will, is the fact that crypto and digital assets is all about no intermediary, right? That''s kind of the end goal or let''s say the ideal answer. Here in traditional finance, you are always dependent on an intermediary, whether it''s a prime broker or a bank. So you can pinpoint any kind of issue and pass on the risk to that counterparty. Here, you know, it''s all algorithm. It''s all technology. So some of those risks you have to manage yourself and you can''t really outsource some of that risk. So the capabilities that you need to build in-house is different from that perspective. So the role of technology in risk management, I would say, is far higher in crypto versus traditional finance. Yeah, I agree entirely. On top of that, I mean, from a point of view of a retailer that actually gets involved in it, sometimes it is for granted, actually, that on the other side there is somebody that is a good actor. And here, unfortunately, it is sometimes it''s not actually. So, you know, the kind of knowledge you need to have properly, you know, the checks that you need to make. I''m just thinking about DeFi specifically, like, you know, a smart contract risk if it''s been audit, not audit. So these are concepts that normal people don''t really know what we are talking about. So they actually log in, they think is safe, and they trade without really thinking too much. They think that on the other side, you have, I don''t know, the same as the normal traditional finance, but it''s not. It''s not because everybody can actually create a protocol, put it on a blockchain, they just create a smart contract, and, you know, and maybe you have a back door to take all the money out. So there is massive risk there. And, you know, we are still, you know, eventually, we''re going to get better, because good actor, obviously, we''re going to be pushed out and the good and the good one, we''re going to stay, we''re going to get bigger, we''re going to attract liquidity, people like Mike will help them actually to get more liquidity. And eventually, you know, like people will just trade on base, and we just leave the other one apart. And I think everyone thinks, oh, crypto is going to come in, and it''s trustless and permissionless, and it''s fixing everything for me, and I don''t need to learn anything, I can just start doing it. At the end of the day, you''re still an investor, it''s up to you to do your own research. There''s always risk when you''re making an investment into any asset class, let alone a brand new one. I want to read you guys a quote that I read last week. It''s a CIO of a very large US pension fund. I was surprised by this. He said blatantly in an interview, quote, he did not see cryptocurrency as an institutionally investable asset class, because it''s low adoption among his peers and allocators, I would argue, that''s the wrong way to think about that. But I do think he is touching on something, despite the enthusiasm, particularly the tailwinds that we''re seeing right now post US election, the institutional investors are not here. And to be fair, I want to make sure we''re all on the same page with that term. Pension funds, endowments, foundations, sovereign wealth funds, they are not here yet. What is it going to take? When is this moment going to happen? What needs to evolve? And I''m going to start with you, Mike. Yeah, I mean, the entire dynamic around how do you need to look into the global asset pool? How do you find yields? I think the bridge mentally into embracing digital assets is a very unique opportunity to increase the size of the global asset pool by trillions of US dollars. And then I come down to what you said on how do we create trust credibility. So the way we look at it, providing end to end liquidity in a very reliable fashion, and also as a regulated house, very much in line with global regulation, I think that is the key thing to get right. But I also would like to just add, if you look into cryptocurrencies in isolation, this is not doing the trick in order to get it right. So I mean, there are figures out there indicating that by 2030, the global tokenization, a tokenized pool of real world assets goes up to 30 trillion US dollars. I think this is quite a big number. But if you believe in that number, even just remotely, you will understand that we are building a full ecosystem that is end-to-end optimized. And I feel then you need to embrace the value creation chain more broadly. So you need to talk about the custody function, the settlement function, the relevance of data needs to come in. And then you basically start understanding that we are not talking about cryptocurrencies in isolation, but about digitizing the planet. And the fragmentation I mentioned at the beginning in traditional financial markets, maybe it''s just, if I''m critical, fair to say we just got used to it and accepted it and built incumbent infrastructure to just relate to it. But the reality is that if you believe in real-time settlement and the availability of technological solutions to move liquidity in real-time from one asset class to another across regions, I mean, this is just a significant step up in efficiency and effectiveness. And that should be the discussion. Which are key terms for any conversation with an institutional investor. So it is peculiar that that has not resonated more firmly yet. Fabio, what do you think it takes? Fabio, what do you think? I agree with Mike. On top of that, I would say that, I don''t know if it works with the microphone. I would say that I think, you know, the gentleman was talking about not investable asset. I mean, you have to, they think at the moment, most of the institution, they think like crypto is a gigantic casino where it is just trading and it''s really no value under that. Well, you can actually choose Bitcoin as digital gold, this kind of, you know, and they stop there. But the reality of fact is exactly what he said. I mean, it''s like behind, there is like a gigantic revolution taking place and there is value to be extracted investing in some specific project or whatever that will actually have abnormal return compared to the traditional assets where normally they are invested. But the issue here is like also, there is a gigantic like issue that is like the people that are managing this big institution, I''m sorry to say that older, and they don''t, they don''t really want to start learning, put their heads down. It''s very difficult actually to study this stuff to try to understand because they''re sitting there and they don''t, they don''t, they don''t feel in a rush. They, you know, they, the guy was talking about his peers. His peers are not doing anything, he''s doing anything. Eventually, a new guy will come, we start investing, he will, you know, they will lag behind, so we''ll be forced actually to get into it. But it''s, to me, it''s inevitable that eventually they will enter and they will actually leave apart this idea that it''s a gigantic casino where people trade in and out and whatever and, you know, and, but it''s value actually to be extracted. Gautam, I would love to hear your perspective on this too. Look, I wouldn''t blame the person who made that comment. To some extent, the signal to noise ratio in this asset class is not great, especially when it comes to how this industry is covered from outside in. And there are, you know, it''s a new technology, right? And there are fringe use cases. People used to say the same thing for internet back in, what, in 1990s and 2000s, right? So you had Amazon, which corrected 96% at one point. So I don''t blame someone looking at it from outside in. Having said that, the way we think about it and the advice we give to our investors is that, look, this is, this is an asset class where you should definitely dabble in. The reality is over the last 17, 18 years, it''s gone to three plus trillion dollars in market cap. So it''s not nothing burger. So there is something going on there. But in order for you to really appreciate what''s going on, you need to invest in this space a much smaller amount that you''re willing to lose. But that gives you an opportunity to learn about this asset class much closer and much deeper. And then you will start to see the potential of it, right? There are applications that are getting built on this, which are generating revenue in hundreds of millions of dollars with much lower FTE count. The number of people involved to build an application is much lower than traditional Web2 stack. So there''s value to it. But it takes time for applications that we are all familiar with to actually come on these rails and then you can use it. We''re starting to see that with payments, stable coins, real world asset tokenization. But I would say, I don''t think media covers it in the right way from that perspective. That should change. And I mean, this is a little controversial question, but do you think, are we far enough where FTX is in the rear view mirror for these institutional investors that they''ve been able to reset what''s been built since and the safety nets that have been put in since and the kind of cleansing that we had? Do you think we are we past that yet? Are we still paying the price for it? We have come a long way. If you haven''t completely passed that phase, as recent as last week, there have been some incidences already and more in the DeFi side of things on the meme coin front. But I would say that the industry has come a long way. You have traditional players who have come into the space. Now, especially for us, most of our trading happens off exchange settlement where you actually keep your assets on custodians while you are able to trade on exchanges. So the technology has come far ahead in terms of the last 18 months since then. There''s more work to be done. Yes, there''s always more work to be done. Okay, we are definitely light on time. So we''re going to fly through these last couple of questions before we get to our speed round. We have to cover centralized exchanges. Mike, give the audience your take. Where is the value of these? Where is the risk? How should people think of centralized exchanges in about 30 seconds? Yeah, I was just about to add. So FDX for me is a call for action, not just for now, but also for the future. When we believe in driving innovation into use cases and transforming the entire infrastructure, if you will, and the way even institutional and retail investors will invest, then I feel we need to make sure that that innovation A becomes super transparent so that investors have a clue of what we are trying to improve and transparency about the benefits. And benefits are, talked about settlement, but availability of data and moving liquidity without fragmentation around it. And as a market maker, I should be quite vocal about price discovery. So getting the best price and giving you a possibility to transact whenever you want to, I think that is a key ingredient. And the last point on data I want to make is, we feel data is perfect, but the reality from TreadFi is the data world is not perfect. Even the data that is available is not perfect in order to feed risk return models. If you believe in digitization, then there is a purifying effect on data quality, and that should massively impact the quality of investing. And it will trickle down from the institutional side into the retail world. So that''s very much a belief I would like to carry forward. Okay, I cannot believe... Oh, sorry, go ahead, Fabian. Sorry. So are you pro-centralized exchange or not? Well, I''m basically decentralized in a way that you need to basically fight fragmentation to make sure that you create interconnectivity and in a way also connectivity across all the different markets. And that is simply possible now with looking into technological advancement and making sure that you''re connecting all the different markets. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Sorry, I didn''t get it. Okay. We''re going to rapid fire speed round here. These truly have to be one or two word answers to keep the integrity of this speed round. So what''s the next Solana? Mike? So I would like to... Two words, two words. So I''m quite excited about our stablecoin project, All Unity. I don''t want to do any marketing, but I very much believe that Europe has a fair chance to embrace a stablecoin in order to accelerate digital adoption. Aptos. Wow. Good shout out. Next Solana is Solana. Say it again. It''s Solana. Solana is the next Solana. Okay. I like that. All right. Bitcoin. Is it going to decouple from the rest of crypto? Yes or no? I don''t think so. Yes. It already has. There we go. Three perspectives. That''s the point of this panel. Finish this sentence in one or two words. Meme coins are? A threat to long-term innovation and adoption. Should be banned. Good to battle test the crypto rails. Perfect. Ready? Public or private blockchain? Public. Public. Public. Public. There we go. On that one, unanimous. Okay. This is my favorite one. I left it best for last. When we used to all, I think we''re all up here, remember using CDs to play music and we thought, oh, this is it. Music will never get better than on a CD. We used to use a rotary phone to make a phone call. We thought, this is all we need. We''re sitting here today, 2025. Take yourselves five years into your future and your careers. What are we going to look back on in this year thinking, oh, that''s what crypto used to do then. Those are the old ways of doing it. So what''s going to be, that''s new now, old in five years? I very much bring it down to the end user experience of investing. I think we fully underestimate the impact on our lives with this. Yeah, I like the idea of, you know, the new way of investing, but I will probably be on an island doing nothing. So I will not probably be here. Thank you, Gatsang. Paying gas fees for everything we do. There we go. Okay. Past, present, future, Wall Street to crypto. Here we go.

So we want to thank everyone in our audience watching us on the live streams. You and I were talking backstage. You were talking about what you think is next in crypto. So why don''t you tell us the sort of categories you''re paying attention to as an entrepreneur, as someone who just really has his pulse on the heartbeat of the blockchain. What are the things that are getting you excited? Apps. Honestly. Too many chains, too little apps. Right? Everybody''s launching blockchain. I talk to people, yeah, I''m dropping this L1, L2. I''m like, dude, I don''t... Respectfully, I don''t care. Yeah. You know, like there''s a lot of great work in blockchains. Ethereum is perfect when you think about it. It''s L1, L2, L3, whatever. Solana''s great. Sui, all these chains are great. But nobody''s working on building actual applications on these blockchains. So for us, we''re at Myriad. That''s what we do best, right? But I think that there''s so much appetite for using crypto, but there''s so little appetite for building actually sustainable tools within crypto. And that''s something that really frustrates me sometimes, but I really think that apps are really the future blockchains. When you talk about apps, I mean, you guys have an amazing prediction market. There''s a lot of folks here, and especially who will be on stage today, talking about gaming. Yeah. That''s a big entry point for us. Are there other types of apps that we use every day in the Web2 world that we should be thinking about for crypto? I think like every single thing we use on a day-to-day is bound to be on chain. Without us really... I think we''re going to remove the crypto from it. Like, you know, what is it? Helium, the cell phone service thing in the USA that''s killing it right now. It''s like free. There''s like this Uber on Solana. Like, there''s so much stuff that we use every day that''s probably going to end up being on chain, but we''re just not going to like feel it. But for me, like it was really about prediction markets because, you know, we''re in media, and it''s the best way to get like consumer sentiment in real time, right? But what do you think? What do you want to see more out of crypto? For me, I want to see less crypto in crypto. I agree with you. I think for me, the folks that are impressing me are the ones that stop talking about blockchains. I think there''s projects, you know, we''ve all talked about Blackbird. We''ve talked about what Luke is doing with Pudgy. The way we can get people to play with crypto when they don''t know they''re playing with crypto is the key. I don''t care what technologies are that I work with on my phone, on my computer. I care that they work. I also don''t think we''ve seen enough good successes of the rewards mechanisms that we were promised, right? Remember when everyone was building like a loyalty play? Yeah. And then every loyalty play became like Starbucks or, you know, a farm. You know, the idea that I could have my airline points, those would convert to my hotel points. They already do that. We don''t need those mechanisms. We need new things. I also like the idea of what could DeFi be if it wasn''t financial, right? So if you think about the idea that I can do alternate ways of getting involved with artists, with creators, with players, any of that, where I don''t have to feel like I''m just trying to beat the fees of the financial system. I like that. I think there''s an opportunity there. DeFi with other financial assets? Yeah, exactly. I think there''s some interesting stuff to play with there. We have a great day today. So both Farok and I are going to be spending some time up here talking to some interesting people. We''ve curated an amazing group of moderators and panelists. We''re going to talk about gaming. We''re going to talk about art. We''re going to talk about a lot of culture. Is there anything you''re excited about for today? Honestly, I think that this stage is going to be pretty well curated, by the way, y''all. Hang tight. I mean, there''s a lot of good people. Obviously, I''m excited to see my friends over that power the space. Well, Kinetic, Mox, so fun. But I really like the fact that we''re focused on culture. Because tech is great, but culture literally powers every single thing in this entire conference. Without culture, without the people speaking for the culture, then there''s very little left when you think about it. Because you talked about how you want to see less crypto in crypto. So the way you get less crypto in crypto is with people like yourself, like myself, and the people who are going to be hosting on the space to empower this industry. There are some people that believe crypto does not have culture. And the reason I say that, and I want to get your reaction, the reason I say that is because when you look at a culture of fashion, you look at the culture of music, gaming, it took years and years to build. And people sort of were doing those actions in the beginning without feeling like they were going to get financially rewarded to it. The minute we put financial rewards into it, we''ve been seeing a lot of bad actors in the last couple months really take advantage of people who want to be in it for the culture. But you''re someone who runs, you run a show every single day. You talk for hours and hours. You''ve really brought so many people into this space. So I think you represent culture better than most people. But what do you think we''re missing in terms of the minute we think we have a culture and then a meme coin comes out and someone rugs $10 million and everyone loses money, they want to run away from this. How do we kind of get culture to be a little bit more sustainable? That''s a tough question today, right? Yeah. Out of all days. We just got rugged so hard by a president. Wait, which president are you talking about? Malay. Okay. I''m making sure. Where''s he at? Is he in prison yet? But, you know, it''s a tough date. It''s weird. It''s such a tough... Like, it''s weird today, man. I''m not going to lie. Because we do have a culture. And we have a beautiful one. And this crypto culture is amazing because when I got into this space, I felt like I was at the cusp of, like, cutting edge of art. I know you''re a big art fan. You''re friends with Sam Spratt, Benny, all those guys. So they run the game, right? You know, Snowfro. So the cutting edge of art, for me, media. I know it''s the same for you. So I''m enamored with media. It''s my passion. It''s what I do every day when I wake up. Last thing I do when I go to sleep. Tech, everything. But then again, you have people that come into our culture, use it, abuse it, and leave us for dead. And then what''s left is you and I on this stage talking about it the day after everybody got destroyed. And it''s tough. So this culture, like, gets weaker and weaker by day. And I feel like a lot of us have to, like, work really hard hand in hand to, like, protect it because it''s a very strong culture. I''m very proud of it. Like, it''s like, I''m as proud to be in crypto as I am proud to be Persian. You know what I mean? It''s like my, there''s a meme. Like, all my friends make fun of me because I''m, like, so proud to be Persian. Like, ah, for real. Not everything''s about being Persian. I''m like, all roads lead back to ancient Persian. You know, I have to joke with that. But it''s like the same thing with crypto, right? And I think we really have to keep building it and building it and defending it, right? There is a culture here. Like, all the people here care about this space. There''s a lot of great founders. I know you guys handpick all the partners that are even allowed to be here and present. Like, there is this culture here and we need to preserve it at all costs. So, you mentioned media. CoinDesk is in the media. You have, really, Rug Radio and Decrypt. So, you have two different media channels. How do you feel when you guys have done all this work to get a story out and then someone, you know, puts a tweet out that they''re just made up because they want to move a market, right? And then suddenly you''re like, ah, all this stuff that I''ve been doing, you know, really can be underdone by someone who has 100,000 followers who happen to, you know, be... Citizen journalism! It''s all citizen journalism. But, like, how can we better play with our public to say, we want you to be a part of the process, but we also want you to trust that, you know, the folks who are putting in the hard work, your reporters, what we do, that that actually is what you should be paying attention to. I mean, it''s funny, right? Because we have both, right? Over at our parent company, Dustin, like, we have Rug Radio and we have Decrypt. So, it''s like a weird... It was actually weird at first because, like, when Lox and I took over Decrypt, I''d be like, whoa, how does this work, dude? Because I''m not a journalist, but I''ve grown to have so much respect for you and what you do as a journalist, like, because we completely separate the companies. I''m not allowed to be in the slack of Decrypt, right? Because God forbid... Probably for the best. No, for the best, really. Like, I''m in no channels. I have no idea what''s going on. I was texting my writer that said, yo, are we covering this Javier Millet thing? Like, do we have someone investigating it? Because I can''t even see. Yeah. I''m not even allowed to be in it, not only because I''m the president, but I''m also a big, like, voice in crypto, like, you know, influencer, whatever. I hate the term, but whatever you call it, but that''s what they call it, right? So, I''m not allowed to have a vision on it. So, it''s different because I''m a creator. I''m never going to call myself a journalist. Actually, that''s an insult to journalism. I think journalism is such a beautiful and pure profession, and I''ve grown to have so much respect for it, even more than before, because what you guys see is like, oh, they''re writing pieces. They''re just writers. They''re not, dude. And there''s so much work that goes behind it, like the piece that you guys wrote that just came out this morning, uncovering a lot of what happened with the Argentina coin. But, like, we''re creators. We create content all day long. But then you have people that spend all their life and that probably make a little less money than the average person with 100,000 followers that''s able to get all these coins, these allocations, because journalists are not allowed to touch any of that. Nothing. Actually, our journalists are not even allowed to predict a myriad. You know what I mean? They''re not even allowed to play. And so it''s so different, but you grow to have so much respect for this. And I think we have to really preserve that, right? The coin that I was talking to you about this behind, CoinDesk, The Crypt, these are companies that are so important to this industry and I genuinely think that we need to do our best to preserve and support them. The final thing I want to talk to you about, I know we''re going to touch on it all day, but we have founders here, we have some of the blockchains here that have been spending years building what they''re building. And, you know, they can have a premise and they can say, we want to build a better technology to do this specific thing. We think the blockchain does really well. They work really hard. They get their token to a $2 billion market cap. Someone comes along, you know, puts a scarf on a pig, you know, has a big influence, and suddenly there''s a meme coin that''s $5 billion. A pig with a scarf. A pig with a scarf, exactly. Don''t start that, please. But, you know, suddenly you have meme coins that have come out of nowhere, are skyrocketing, and becoming more valuable in some of these chains that people have been building years to build. And, you know, and then we also see because of this, everyone wants to get in on the next $5 billion coin. And suddenly, you know, I saw this with some friends of mine over the weekend. They launched a coin, it went to $12 million. By the next day, it was worthless. Yeah, of course. Right? All in less than 24 hours. So, as someone who plays a lot in the cultural side of it, how do we address the fact that meme culture, while being amazing and part of our future, also has a tremendous easy way of being gamed by those on the inside? I mean, the casino is rigged. And there''s never been a better day to say this than today. You know, it''s demoralizing. Because for me, it''s weird. I have the trader culture, like, influencer Farouk hat. Then there''s, like, the founder Farouk. Yeah. And we work so freaking hard to build Myriad. And it gets a lot of attention. Thank God. I''m lucky. We get a lot of attention. We have all the attention on the planet. So I''m blessed. But so many founders out here, they get zero attention. But they''re way more talented than 99% of the people I''ve ever met in my freaking life. That''s why we try to empower them as much as possible on the rock video side. It''s demoralizing. There''s nothing more demoralizing than seeing meme coins go to billions of dollars and you''re working your ass off to build something that''s worthless. Yeah. Why? Right? But on the other side, this casino''s about to... I think the casino''s... I mean, the casino never closes. There''s always gonna be a win. Yeah. Right? But there''s always gonna be a Flamingo and that shit ain''t good. Right? No offense to the Flamingo owners. But, you know, it''s just like... This casino is rigged. It''s rugged. It''s fake. And I highly encourage people to start actually empowering founders. Sure. Sure. You may make your money slower. You may get your return on these blockchains you''re investing in over 6, 12, 24, 48 months. But at least, you''re not gonna get destroyed overnight. Because there''s a lot of these meme coins you hold. You don''t know if you can go to bed. Actually, I left the casino months ago. Good for you. A few months ago, I said, I''m done. Do a little trade. It''s nice. Stop. And my Oura Ring has never had... Told me I''ve never had better sleep than the last month. I swear to God, there''s data to back that. So, I highly encourage people to just maybe... Go around. Turn off the casino. Turn off the casino for a little bit. Okay? Shut it down. Okay? It''s good. I''m not... I love Pomfon. I like the founders. I love the whole thing. I''m a fan. It would be hypocritical for me to say I''m not a fan. But go around. Meet some people, you know? See what''s up in the space. Well, speaking of that, so this day, on this stage, all day, we''re going to have some amazing creators, people who are building some incredible companies, some who have had great successes. We''re going to talk to them, the gaming space, the AI space, the art space. We''re going to talk about all the people who are building crypto-native brands and the lessons to learn. So, with that, we''re going to get to our content. Farouk''s going to leave for a minute. Yes, sir. I''m going to stay here, interview a founder and an amazing marketer I look up to very much. So, Farouk, love that. Thank you so much. Thank you for grabbing me. I''ll see you at 1.30.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('web3-blueprint', 'Web3 Blueprint for Hong Kong Report', 'Web3 Harbor 代表', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' . Extremely humbled for this opportunity to launch the Web3 Hong Kong Blueprints. Firstly, I want to introduce Web3 Harbor. Now, Web3 Harbor is the region''s premier pro-innovation, pro-collaboration Web3 Industry Association. You may know us over the last, I don''t know, year and a half across Hong Kong for various different reasons, but I want to focus on a few notable areas that I''m extremely proud for the association to be part of. First and foremost, last year, we ran a month-long celebration at Hong Kong Fintech Week called Blocktober, and it was an astounding success. We also have done multiple smart contact series every third Thursday of every month. We have an industry leader, industry executive, coming to talk to us about all the on-goings and updates from across the world. And lastly, to the core of why Web3 Harbor is so special, we have two subcommittees. One subcommittee focused on enterprise development, basically Hong Kong-listed companies and Hong Kong-originated companies wanting to build Web3 use cases with the rest of the ecosystem. And the other one is our regulatory and VATP subcommittee, focused on improving the experience of licensees through the process and for incumbents to maximize their license. So, why are we here today? You know, one thing about Web3 Harbor that''s so special is the community that we represent. We have over 25, 27 companies actually, I''ve just updated, 27 companies that focus on why Web3 should be the key focus of Hong Kong. And that leads us to our key learnings. Our key learnings around how to build the future of finance with Web3 in mind for Hong Kong. What is the blueprint? The blueprint, simply put, is the private sector''s commitment to Hong Kong government priorities. And the first of these many priorities announced and launched last year at the Hong Kong FinTech Week is how does Hong Kong become an international financial hub with Web3 in mind. So, as we get through that, I do want to talk about how we came up with this process. It does not happen in an echo chamber. It''s really important to have consultation, collaboration, and sticking to our pro-collaboration, pro-innovation commitment, the idea was to first connect with the Hong Kong government to understand where the gaps were in terms of moving this to the next generation financial hub. Through that process, we assembled a really rock star team, and they''re sitting here up in the front, of industry experts from our membership. And through this approach, we were able to come up with a first draft of the report, of the blueprint. And so you see here today, we''re in the middle of this process. So, after immediately this discussion, we will open it up for public consultation. And in this, we really need the help from the community to read, to understand, as well as to give feedback to this entire process. And once that happens, we will be able to commit to the government and to the rest of the Web3 ecosystem, what''s next before we move into the next version of the commitments from the various priorities. Okay. So, this concept, which, you know, I was speaking to our chairman, Gary Liu, about this. And he had made a very, very astute conversation about having different types of regulation and jurisdictions that regulate differently around the world. So, some accept and allow crypto. But what''s unique about Hong Kong is the active purpose of integrating crypto with the current financial system in the markets. So, this is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity that should not be taken lightly. Now, in terms of why Hong Kong has the right to win and the right to play in this space, just fundamentally at its core, from Hong Kong''s pre-existence of really driving innovation with a lot of the crypto infrastructure that we take for granted, many people obviously know, but some may not. A lot of the infrastructure that we take for granted today has come and originated from Hong Kong. Now, moving forward, because we have this pedigree and specifically just from the traditional financial sense, eight trillion dollars assets under management, over 15,000 organizations and institutions operate here in Hong Kong, and then we are a multi-lateral trade focused hub from cross-border activities. We deserve and we have the right to win in the virtual asset space, to create new products, lead in standards, adoption and regulation, as well as be the super connector from east and west. How do we actually start getting there? And so the Web3 Blueprint is this approach, this framework, and it''s right here. There''s multiple different sections. We will focus and deep dive into areas between Web3 talent and how we actually take practical steps from the private sector, alongside the priorities with the Hong Kong government, to make this a reality. First and foremost, focusing on the current existing extant structure, which is Cyberport and Science Park. And then really thinking about what other private sector commitments can we actually look at to make sure that this is actually robust and competitive. Next thing is what I call market-tecture. You know, it''s very funny. We were going through this entire process of talking about, okay, what blockchain infrastructure, what systems, what solutions, and we always kept going to this market infrastructure, market architecture. Market-tecture is really what we need. It''s this really close, no daylight synergy between what the market and the business needs and what we can actually do with infrastructure and Web3 technology. And so some of the things I really, really want to focus on with the architecture is really on the artificial intelligence integration with Web3. Another thing is around the adoption of standards for the movement and transfer of information so that we can have these robust systems in place. Standards. Standards, extremely, extremely important. One of the key areas of standards is really being able to accept global international standards as well as set them. Setting standards is not only important for our presence as the international financial hub, but also for the ability for us to explore and innovate. And this leads to other regulation activities and sandbox activities. Technology contribution commitment from market diversification. One of the areas I think is truly special in this blueprint, as you''ll see, is a call to action. The call to action from private sector to participate in private sector-led sandboxes to ideate and test different use cases. Now use cases often misconstrued with we need to find a reason to build on Web3. In fact, if you have to find a reason to build on Web3, that''s already late to the game. So one thing is creating new opportunities from scratch that not necessarily requires pre-existing infrastructure and processes to be renewed, but looking at new products and services that have been created with people like in this regulatory subcommittee as well as the enterprise subcommittee. Regulation. Regulation has been a hot and important topic for Hong Kong and our existence as an association for quite some time. But I think moving forward, one of the very interesting areas is supervisory technology. So understanding how Hong Kong can be not only a trend center in terms of standards, but also focusing on what it means to be an international financial hub when we''re looking at regulatory, regtech, and supervisory tech. Okay, so with all of these different opportunities in play, how can you contribute? What is the value add and what is the call to action that we have for the audience today? Okay. Very simple. Scan. Read. And we will have a form. And this form, again, is open until the end of this quarter. After, we''ll publish a final version of this paper in which we''ll move over to elements of the FSDC policy so we can start moving towards a policy position. And then we will restart this process for the next commitment. Over the next two to three quarters leading into the next policy address. I''m super excited about this because this allows us to create a backbone. A backbone of discourse with private and public sector. And then a focus to separate both from a marketing perspective, as well as from a policy and regulatory contribution. I really, really want to thank everybody today for taking the time to come and be part of this. Again, the call to action. Please get on. Please share with your friends. And people who are not from Hong Kong, please enjoy the city. And as Honorable Paul Chan said, make it the most while you''re here today. But before I close out, there''s actually something special. You know, this blueprint wasn''t built by people who were paid to do this. It was, again, a task force assembled of industry experts and subject matters. Sorry. Industry leaders and subject matter experts in their respective fields with priorities focused on the policy address. So it''s very important to understand and thank those individuals for all the contributions they made throughout the entire process. And I wanted to take the opportunity today to also talk about our first commitment that we can immediately address. So one of our members, IDA, you may know them from the Sablecoin activities that they are engaged in. They have created the Web3 Future Leaders Program with various different universities here in Hong Kong. And I''m excited to talk about how they''ve actually connected that with our first commitment. And through this, I hope that there will be more and more commitments from the rest of the private sector and the rest of our membership. So with that said, I wanted to thank the team and have a wonderful consensus. And then also please, again, take a look at this blueprint, contribute, and give us your feedback. Because it''s so important to have the public information back to us. Thanks, doctor. Thank you. Speaker 1 We''re housed in town. And there''s one.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('web3-incentives', 'Web3 Incentives for a Sustainable Future: Simplifying Participation for Mass Adoption', 'Arvin Cain', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Arvin Cain Reviewer Hi everyone, I''m Arvin Cain, and I''m a co-founder of Incentive. I basically come from the background technology for now almost 30 years. And I just love solving, basically, problems. It''s kind of like my hobby, but I also have this history of actually getting involved with anything that has true purpose. And so I wanted to kind of give you an understanding of why another layer one needed to be created. And when I''m basically being approached to truly solve something that has to do with adoption, because I''ve been basically involved in a lot of layer ones, layer twos, layer zeros, ZK layers, and I''m seeing adoption as a core issue in our industry. And I also look at it and saying, okay, well, why if Amazon comes in and plays basically this blockchain game, how relevant is every booth in here? How many companies in our industry would basically like be obsolete? And when they play that game, are we relevant? And I think about the ethos of why actually I got into crypto and why blockchain actually became something of relevance for me. And it was just one sentence that basically got my attention, which is value transfer in a trustless environment. But then going through all these cycles and experiencing basically blockchain firsthand in DeFi, DApps, mining, staking, you name it all. You basically realize that a lot of bad actors out there are looking to take advantage of these complexities that we created in Web3 and then kind of exploit your assets or your users'' assets. And it doesn''t matter if it''s badger.com and what happened there or if it happens with like, you know, centralized investment strategies like what you saw with Celsius and 3AC. All of that showed me that we are kind of creating more complex solutions that then allow bad actors to take advantage of our user base or the protocols and really not create the value because something''s off. And then I look at like D-Pin and its relevance and I say, hmm, didn''t Meta try to do the Metaverse? Why didn''t it work? They had all the capital. They had all the users. They could do all the marketing. But they couldn''t get anyone to actually adopt it. And it has something to do with the ethos that we stand for as blockchain entrepreneurs or crypto, like, you know, heroes, as I call it. Because we are brave and you are trying to change something about the system that is actually failing us. So what is holding blockchain back? And in my view, I look at like all the protocols I''ve worked with, all the adoptions. And it just shows me that what is holding us back is that we kind of from the ground off are building something that''s again centralized in nature. It doesn''t matter if it''s Solana, if it''s Avalanche, if it''s Sui. We have a foundation that makes the rules. They apply those rules. I bring in the big user base on Solana. They''re doing meme coin mints. And guess what? Everyone gets rugged. And we''re seeing what is occurring right now with Trump coin, Libra, all of that just showing us that basically the incentive structure is off. We''re basically rugging our user base. The DAP providers are basically being sued by the SEC because they''re creating a pump.fund solution. And what happens to Solana and the protocol? They seem to be not harmed. So my view really was how do I actually build something that actually puts every stakeholder in a decentralized way as the contribution and the stakeholder of the whole network and the ecosystem by rewarding actually their contribution and basically making sure that they''re being valued from day one, not just the foundation, not just from the first building block. So last year I went out and say, I like this idea. Let me put actually an engineering team and UI specialists together and let''s look at what the problems are actually. And we went out and interviewed people at different conferences to basically understand, hey, what do you like and what you don''t like about the blockchain industry? What is the most frustrating? It''s frustrating. I would say the most frustrating things are the barrier to entry. How unsimple is, I guess. The fact that it''s really, really, really difficult for anybody to understand what''s going on. It''s too hard to use. The most frustrating things. UX experience. We need more people, users, and we need to break these eyes and get it into the masses. What are the most frustrating things in blockchain technology? I would say it''s the user side right now, the consumer side of it. Yeah, I would have to say it''s actually creating applications for it. Usability, connectability, and it''s not ready yet for a mass audience. It''s still very technical, so people who are, let''s say, less advanced, they can''t get into it. So clearly we have some friction points that we need to solve. A lot of you are basically trying to solve them. Each domain area, each domain expert is coming in here. And, but at the end, we''re doing it kind of literally at the exit. The protocol is established. And at the end, we''re trying to create a DeFi strategy that then works with that protocol. And it''s basically rules that were set from day one. And when the value of the protocol goes up, the protocol and the foundation becomes very basically rich. And it''s able to invest into the ecosystem, get more adoption until something happens that then could be an exploit. Could be the network goes down or something actually just off. I mean, we''ve seen different scenarios in the past. Luna is a perfect example for me there. So, or FTX in regards of like, you know, a made of strategy there. But my main thing really, what I was trying to figure out is like, okay, how do I add the ethos and the purpose into the layer from the foundation out and build actually something that has an architecture that creates incentive structure so that all stakeholders basically are being rewarded based on the utility of the layer one in itself. And how do I make it effortless? And when I look at effortless, I looked at every application out there that actually has millions of users. So I look at Venmo and I''m like, hey, if I actually want to Venmo something, it''s very simple. Username, I don''t have to worry about the massive address, Bitcoin address, Ethereum address. I can actually just send it to you. It works. I get a confirmation. You can then use those funds. Your on-off ramping is already established. If you are not a Venmo user, I can invite you quite quickly. And you don''t have to deal with seed phrases. So all these friction points are not there. So I''m like, what are we doing? Why are we creating more complexity? Oh, wait, that''s right. Because we were trying to make it decentralized. We want to actually not have a central system. We don''t want to be exploited by the data hungry companies like Meta or X or TikTok or whoever it is. So when I think about that, my main thing really is how do I make sure that simplicity, the seven second attention span that we now have, which is actually less than a goldfish, which is actually the human condition now, how do I actually use that as like my entry point to build something that is sustainable, something that''s decentralized, something that actually is resilient to what is coming next. And again, we have speculation, we have complexity, but we''re failing to onboard mass adoption. So what we did at Incentive was said, okay, we got to actually start with account abstraction being built in into our chain. So that it doesn''t require a user to basically figure out how to set up a seed phrase to set up an account. Fingerprint, face ID, just an email account. Let you onboard as fast as possible, just like you do with any kind of Web 2 experience. But it needs to be decentralized so that we don''t want the central entity actually own all your data because then at the end of the day, we''re back in the meta thing where you''re being milked for time, you''re milked for your data and they''re becoming rich. Their shareholders basically are buying another jet and you''re trying to figure out how to, you know, not be addicted to this IG experience. So my main thing was really about, okay, how do I actually allow account abstractions to be part of the layer solution so that if we''re building and scaling this, it''s basically built into the secret sauce of our Web 3 solution. And what I mean with that is that, okay, if you''re paying with a token like a PEPIT token and you need to basically make sure that the other user is getting tethered, that should be built into the protocol. Why is it such a complex thing of swapping? The fact that I have to go through multiple conversions of the asset type that I''m actually converting to convert that this is the application actually I want to convert on and go through all these confirmation steps, that means I''m just allowing other hackers or bad actors to exploit myself in that process. And what that exploit does, it just creates vulnerability for our adoption cycles. Because I think most of you here have been exploited before. If not, I hope it doesn''t happen. When it happens, it''s like a big kick in the stomach and it feels horrible and you feel not safe. But we still continue to stand here because we see something in this revolution that is worth actually pursuing. And what I mean with that is like, I want to make sure that the backed actors don''t have too many layers of access and vulnerabilities in our process of engagement. When I look at like Amazon and I set up an account on there, it''s very simple. Why are we creating something that basically allows bad actors to actually intercept you in a confirmation process around your asset type, then actually take out those assets while you actually confirm that you''re transferring them to someone. So for us, it''s very important that we''re actually solving problems with each of those friction points that actually currently are not allowing our industry to grow. Just like I said, multi-step actions. Make that in one click. Schedules dynamics. So for example, Shopify or Venmo. If I actually purchase something and I already have my shipping address and everything already established because I did already a prior purchase. Why do I have to re-enter it again? The fact that I actually can just adopt based on my user profile that information and just have a one click purchase option. That should be built into our chain. It should be something that is actually fundamental. In addition to that, we have something called a safeguard. How do we actually ensure that my assets are being actually held safe so that I''m not exposing them to an exploit? How do I actually schedule recurring payments and subscriptions that are basically continuous so that I don''t have to set them up continuously so that I''m not trapped in an exploit that actually happened in Discord? Because there''s a new NFT drop that I really want to mint and I want to mint it really fast and therefore I lost all my assets. You know, I think I lost three NFTs on that. So easy to read addresses. I have plenty of friends and me included that basically, you know, I''m like how many times we have copy and pasted the wrong address? Or how many times did I actually have a friend who had a security vulnerability where they copy and paste an address? They had some Trojan in there that actually then replaced that address with a new address. They thought, hey, I just copy and paste it and instantly they lost their assets. And how do I actually create an onboarding and viral element into the chain where it''s easy for me to go viral and actually invite people into my DAP without actually like creating frictions that I have 5% of crypto users adopting my DAP? I want to actually have all the Web 2 users engaged with my applications without actually making them feel like they''re creating a vulnerability for themselves. So really what we''ve been focusing on is how do we solve key friction points within our ecosystem? And how do we bring it to life? And for me, it''s important that everyone that''s actually engaging in this protocol is engaging with a reward mechanism so that they actually know that their participation. If I''m a whale on a network, I want to actually be valued for my contribution of volume and engagement. If I have a DAP that actually is bringing massive value to the chain, I want to actually be valued. If I''m basically switching to a system, yeah, we''ll give you basically an onboarding grant through our ecosystem fund. But if you actually generate volume, I want you to be basically rewarded for that. So it''s really about the stakeholders being part of the whole DAP strategy from ground off, not just the foundation, not just the engineers. So that we actually have something that''s sustainable and resilient for the growth dynamics that are occurring. Because otherwise, we''re just competing with multiple layers out there. And I look at like, for example, Avalanche. How much revenue are they generating basically on their protocol? And how is that revenue actually sustain them as a foundation? And how does that actually work out long term? Are they going to sell their user base? Are they going to merge? Like what is the monetization strategy on their side? Is it just staking assets? Is it DeFi? Is it actually NFTs? Is it gaming? Is it real world asset wrapping? What does that mean? How is that solving a true problem? And how are those providers actually truly being rewarded for actually solving those problems within the network? So for me, it''s really about monetization from day one. Every action counts. Meaning that every action within the network is being rewarded continuously, transparent. So that it actually really goes back to why we''re doing this. Transparency. It''s on the ledger. That''s why Elon right now is basically saying, hey, let''s put all the government spending on blockchain. I agree. I want to know that. I want to run a real time freaking audit. I want Ernst & Young and all those guys to go bankrupt. Because what? They''re charging large fees to basically do an audit in a time where we basically can have a ledger system and instantly know in real time if you had steak but you''re claiming to be a vegetarian. I think that''s the future I want to live in. A future of truth that''s on chain. And if you want to utilize ZKs because you want to have some privacy, do that. That''s fine. But all of these solutions need to be combined in a way that''s actually relevant and sustainable. So when I''m talking about the distribution model of incentive, it''s really about like how we take the network fees, do you convert them actually into the incentive token, and then create actually rewards that distributed all the stakeholders. And who are the stakeholders is all the active wallets. Like why do an airdrop to actually inactive wallets that actually are just proxy wallets, what we''re seeing in basically Solana where you have snipers pushing it out to inactive wallets. And then they''re basically reintroducing those tokens back into the network. While it developers and app developers, I want to make sure that they actually be incentivized based on adoption flows. I want to make sure that network operators and node operators are actually being incentivized in the right way to actually have the right tools and reward system for them to become sustainable because they are key. And when I''m talking about planet Earth, it''s like, okay, even carbon tax credits, because I''m using electricity and we even have an allocation to make sure that we have an offset on what it takes for us to actually run all these nodes. Because it''s important that the purpose is very deep in regards of like how we actually integrate our model and think about, hey, where are we going to be 10 years from now if this truly scales into mass adoption? So what I''d like for you to do is actually check out our test net. You can come to our booth. It''s actually right back there. You can also inquire about our ecosystem fund and the grants that we have to onboard you as developers. And really actually test out that test net in regards of seeing actually how well it works, how easy it is to use. When what I love is that I actually see most of the passion that fuels me within all my team members. Their feedback is actually what actually gets me here on stage because they''re telling me that there''s something, they''re building something that''s changing our industry. And that they''re proud, not because they want to have a multi-billion dollar market cap. Maybe that happens. That''s actually more of like a secondary thing. Like an artist doesn''t think about like how much this art is going to sell for. They''re thinking about like how big of an impact this is going to have from a consensus perspective, from a new approach perspective. And when I hear that purpose driven feedback from my team members, that makes me proud. And so I would like love for you to actually meet some of them at our booth, even talk to me for us to actually show you how we''re changing the game of layer one. Because I think that layer one needs to be redefined. And that''s exactly what we''re doing with incentive. Thank you guys.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('web3_blueprint_for_hong_kong_report', 'Web3 Blueprint for Hong Kong Report', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' . Extremely humbled for this opportunity to launch the Web3 Hong Kong Blueprints. Firstly, I want to introduce Web3 Harbor. Now, Web3 Harbor is the region''s premier pro-innovation, pro-collaboration Web3 Industry Association. You may know us over the last, I don''t know, year and a half across Hong Kong for various different reasons, but I want to focus on a few notable areas that I''m extremely proud for the association to be part of. First and foremost, last year, we ran a month-long celebration at Hong Kong Fintech Week called Blocktober, and it was an astounding success. We also have done multiple smart contact series every third Thursday of every month. We have an industry leader, industry executive, coming to talk to us about all the on-goings and updates from across the world. And lastly, to the core of why Web3 Harbor is so special, we have two subcommittees. One subcommittee focused on enterprise development, basically Hong Kong-listed companies and Hong Kong-originated companies wanting to build Web3 use cases with the rest of the ecosystem. And the other one is our regulatory and VATP subcommittee, focused on improving the experience of licensees through the process and for incumbents to maximize their license. So, why are we here today? You know, one thing about Web3 Harbor that''s so special is the community that we represent. We have over 25, 27 companies actually, I''ve just updated, 27 companies that focus on why Web3 should be the key focus of Hong Kong. And that leads us to our key learnings. Our key learnings around how to build the future of finance with Web3 in mind for Hong Kong. What is the blueprint? The blueprint, simply put, is the private sector''s commitment to Hong Kong government priorities. And the first of these many priorities announced and launched last year at the Hong Kong FinTech Week is how does Hong Kong become an international financial hub with Web3 in mind. So, as we get through that, I do want to talk about how we came up with this process. It does not happen in an echo chamber. It''s really important to have consultation, collaboration, and sticking to our pro-collaboration, pro-innovation commitment, the idea was to first connect with the Hong Kong government to understand where the gaps were in terms of moving this to the next generation financial hub. Through that process, we assembled a really rock star team, and they''re sitting here up in the front, of industry experts from our membership. And through this approach, we were able to come up with a first draft of the report, of the blueprint. And so you see here today, we''re in the middle of this process. So, after immediately this discussion, we will open it up for public consultation. And in this, we really need the help from the community to read, to understand, as well as to give feedback to this entire process. And once that happens, we will be able to commit to the government and to the rest of the Web3 ecosystem, what''s next before we move into the next version of the commitments from the various priorities. Okay. So, this concept, which, you know, I was speaking to our chairman, Gary Liu, about this. And he had made a very, very astute conversation about having different types of regulation and jurisdictions that regulate differently around the world. So, some accept and allow crypto. But what''s unique about Hong Kong is the active purpose of integrating crypto with the current financial system in the markets. So, this is a multi-trillion dollar opportunity that should not be taken lightly. Now, in terms of why Hong Kong has the right to win and the right to play in this space, just fundamentally at its core, from Hong Kong''s pre-existence of really driving innovation with a lot of the crypto infrastructure that we take for granted, many people obviously know, but some may not. A lot of the infrastructure that we take for granted today has come and originated from Hong Kong. Now, moving forward, because we have this pedigree and specifically just from the traditional financial sense, eight trillion dollars assets under management, over 15,000 organizations and institutions operate here in Hong Kong, and then we are a multi-lateral trade focused hub from cross-border activities. We deserve and we have the right to win in the virtual asset space, to create new products, lead in standards, adoption and regulation, as well as be the super connector from east and west. How do we actually start getting there? And so the Web3 Blueprint is this approach, this framework, and it''s right here. There''s multiple different sections. We will focus and deep dive into areas between Web3 talent and how we actually take practical steps from the private sector, alongside the priorities with the Hong Kong government, to make this a reality. First and foremost, focusing on the current existing extant structure, which is Cyberport and Science Park. And then really thinking about what other private sector commitments can we actually look at to make sure that this is actually robust and competitive. Next thing is what I call market-tecture. You know, it''s very funny. We were going through this entire process of talking about, okay, what blockchain infrastructure, what systems, what solutions, and we always kept going to this market infrastructure, market architecture. Market-tecture is really what we need. It''s this really close, no daylight synergy between what the market and the business needs and what we can actually do with infrastructure and Web3 technology. And so some of the things I really, really want to focus on with the architecture is really on the artificial intelligence integration with Web3. Another thing is around the adoption of standards for the movement and transfer of information so that we can have these robust systems in place. Standards. Standards, extremely, extremely important. One of the key areas of standards is really being able to accept global international standards as well as set them. Setting standards is not only important for our presence as the international financial hub, but also for the ability for us to explore and innovate. And this leads to other regulation activities and sandbox activities. Technology contribution commitment from market diversification. One of the areas I think is truly special in this blueprint, as you''ll see, is a call to action. The call to action from private sector to participate in private sector-led sandboxes to ideate and test different use cases. Now use cases often misconstrued with we need to find a reason to build on Web3. In fact, if you have to find a reason to build on Web3, that''s already late to the game. So one thing is creating new opportunities from scratch that not necessarily requires pre-existing infrastructure and processes to be renewed, but looking at new products and services that have been created with people like in this regulatory subcommittee as well as the enterprise subcommittee. Regulation. Regulation has been a hot and important topic for Hong Kong and our existence as an association for quite some time. But I think moving forward, one of the very interesting areas is supervisory technology. So understanding how Hong Kong can be not only a trend center in terms of standards, but also focusing on what it means to be an international financial hub when we''re looking at regulatory, regtech, and supervisory tech. Okay, so with all of these different opportunities in play, how can you contribute? What is the value add and what is the call to action that we have for the audience today? Okay. Very simple. Scan. Read. And we will have a form. And this form, again, is open until the end of this quarter. After, we''ll publish a final version of this paper in which we''ll move over to elements of the FSDC policy so we can start moving towards a policy position. And then we will restart this process for the next commitment. Over the next two to three quarters leading into the next policy address. I''m super excited about this because this allows us to create a backbone. A backbone of discourse with private and public sector. And then a focus to separate both from a marketing perspective, as well as from a policy and regulatory contribution. I really, really want to thank everybody today for taking the time to come and be part of this. Again, the call to action. Please get on. Please share with your friends. And people who are not from Hong Kong, please enjoy the city. And as Honorable Paul Chan said, make it the most while you''re here today. But before I close out, there''s actually something special. You know, this blueprint wasn''t built by people who were paid to do this. It was, again, a task force assembled of industry experts and subject matters. Sorry. Industry leaders and subject matter experts in their respective fields with priorities focused on the policy address. So it''s very important to understand and thank those individuals for all the contributions they made throughout the entire process. And I wanted to take the opportunity today to also talk about our first commitment that we can immediately address. So one of our members, IDA, you may know them from the Sablecoin activities that they are engaged in. They have created the Web3 Future Leaders Program with various different universities here in Hong Kong. And I''m excited to talk about how they''ve actually connected that with our first commitment. And through this, I hope that there will be more and more commitments from the rest of the private sector and the rest of our membership. So with that said, I wanted to thank the team and have a wonderful consensus. And then also please, again, take a look at this blueprint, contribute, and give us your feedback. Because it''s so important to have the public information back to us. Thanks, doctor. Thank you. Speaker 1 We''re housed in town. And there''s one. You And the', '.

INSERT INTO public.conferences VALUES ('web3_incentives_for_a_sustainable_future__simplifying_participation_for_mass_adoption', 'Web3 Incentives for a Sustainable Future_ Simplifying Participation for Mass Adoption', '未知講者', 'Technical Sessions & Case Studies', ' Arvin Cain Reviewer Hi everyone, I''m Arvin Cain, and I''m a co-founder of Incentive. I basically come from the background technology for now almost 30 years. And I just love solving, basically, problems. It''s kind of like my hobby, but I also have this history of actually getting involved with anything that has true purpose. And so I wanted to kind of give you an understanding of why another layer one needed to be created. And when I''m basically being approached to truly solve something that has to do with adoption, because I''ve been basically involved in a lot of layer ones, layer twos, layer zeros, ZK layers, and I''m seeing adoption as a core issue in our industry. And I also look at it and saying, okay, well, why if Amazon comes in and plays basically this blockchain game, how relevant is every booth in here? How many companies in our industry would basically like be obsolete? And when they play that game, are we relevant? And I think about the ethos of why actually I got into crypto and why blockchain actually became something of relevance for me. And it was just one sentence that basically got my attention, which is value transfer in a trustless environment. But then going through all these cycles and experiencing basically blockchain firsthand in DeFi, DApps, mining, staking, you name it all. You basically realize that a lot of bad actors out there are looking to take advantage of these complexities that we created in Web3 and then kind of exploit your assets or your users'' assets. And it doesn''t matter if it''s badger.com and what happened there or if it happens with like, you know, centralized investment strategies like what you saw with Celsius and 3AC. All of that showed me that we are kind of creating more complex solutions that then allow bad actors to take advantage of our user base or the protocols and really not create the value because something''s off. And then I look at like D-Pin and its relevance and I say, hmm, didn''t Meta try to do the Metaverse? Why didn''t it work? They had all the capital. They had all the users. They could do all the marketing. But they couldn''t get anyone to actually adopt it. And it has something to do with the ethos that we stand for as blockchain entrepreneurs or crypto, like, you know, heroes, as I call it. Because we are brave and you are trying to change something about the system that is actually failing us. So what is holding blockchain back? And in my view, I look at like all the protocols I''ve worked with, all the adoptions. And it just shows me that what is holding us back is that we kind of from the ground off are building something that''s again centralized in nature. It doesn''t matter if it''s Solana, if it''s Avalanche, if it''s Sui. We have a foundation that makes the rules. They apply those rules. I bring in the big user base on Solana. They''re doing meme coin mints. And guess what? Everyone gets rugged. And we''re seeing what is occurring right now with Trump coin, Libra, all of that just showing us that basically the incentive structure is off. We''re basically rugging our user base. The DAP providers are basically being sued by the SEC because they''re creating a pump.fund solution. And what happens to Solana and the protocol? They seem to be not harmed. So my view really was how do I actually build something that actually puts every stakeholder in a decentralized way as the contribution and the stakeholder of the whole network and the ecosystem by rewarding actually their contribution and basically making sure that they''re being valued from day one, not just the foundation, not just from the first building block. So last year I went out and say, I like this idea. Let me put actually an engineering team and UI specialists together and let''s look at what the problems are actually. And we went out and interviewed people at different conferences to basically understand, hey, what do you like and what you don''t like about the blockchain industry? What is the most frustrating? It''s frustrating. I would say the most frustrating things are the barrier to entry. How unsimple is, I guess. The fact that it''s really, really, really difficult for anybody to understand what''s going on. It''s too hard to use. The most frustrating things. UX experience. We need more people, users, and we need to break these eyes and get it into the masses. What are the most frustrating things in blockchain technology? I would say it''s the user side right now, the consumer side of it. Yeah, I would have to say it''s actually creating applications for it. Usability, connectability, and it''s not ready yet for a mass audience. It''s still very technical, so people who are, let''s say, less advanced, they can''t get into it. So clearly we have some friction points that we need to solve. A lot of you are basically trying to solve them. Each domain area, each domain expert is coming in here. And, but at the end, we''re doing it kind of literally at the exit. The protocol is established. And at the end, we''re trying to create a DeFi strategy that then works with that protocol. And it''s basically rules that were set from day one. And when the value of the protocol goes up, the protocol and the foundation becomes very basically rich. And it''s able to invest into the ecosystem, get more adoption until something happens that then could be an exploit. Could be the network goes down or something actually just off. I mean, we''ve seen different scenarios in the past. Luna is a perfect example for me there. So, or FTX in regards of like, you know, a made of strategy there. But my main thing really, what I was trying to figure out is like, okay, how do I add the ethos and the purpose into the layer from the foundation out and build actually something that has an architecture that creates incentive structure so that all stakeholders basically are being rewarded based on the utility of the layer one in itself. And how do I make it effortless? And when I look at effortless, I looked at every application out there that actually has millions of users. So I look at Venmo and I''m like, hey, if I actually want to Venmo something, it''s very simple. Username, I don''t have to worry about the massive address, Bitcoin address, Ethereum address. I can actually just send it to you. It works. I get a confirmation. You can then use those funds. Your on-off ramping is already established. If you are not a Venmo user, I can invite you quite quickly. And you don''t have to deal with seed phrases. So all these friction points are not there. So I''m like, what are we doing? Why are we creating more complexity? Oh, wait, that''s right. Because we were trying to make it decentralized. We want to actually not have a central system. We don''t want to be exploited by the data hungry companies like Meta or X or TikTok or whoever it is. So when I think about that, my main thing really is how do I make sure that simplicity, the seven second attention span that we now have, which is actually less than a goldfish, which is actually the human condition now, how do I actually use that as like my entry point to build something that is sustainable, something that''s decentralized, something that actually is resilient to what is coming next. And again, we have speculation, we have complexity, but we''re failing to onboard mass adoption. So what we did at Incentive was said, okay, we got to actually start with account abstraction being built in into our chain. So that it doesn''t require a user to basically figure out how to set up a seed phrase to set up an account. Fingerprint, face ID, just an email account. Let you onboard as fast as possible, just like you do with any kind of Web 2 experience. But it needs to be decentralized so that we don''t want the central entity actually own all your data because then at the end of the day, we''re back in the meta thing where you''re being milked for time, you''re milked for your data and they''re becoming rich. Their shareholders basically are buying another jet and you''re trying to figure out how to, you know, not be addicted to this IG experience. So my main thing was really about, okay, how do I actually allow account abstractions to be part of the layer solution so that if we''re building and scaling this, it''s basically built into the secret sauce of our Web 3 solution. And what I mean with that is that, okay, if you''re paying with a token like a PEPIT token and you need to basically make sure that the other user is getting tethered, that should be built into the protocol. Why is it such a complex thing of swapping? The fact that I have to go through multiple conversions of the asset type that I''m actually converting to convert that this is the application actually I want to convert on and go through all these confirmation steps, that means I''m just allowing other hackers or bad actors to exploit myself in that process. And what that exploit does, it just creates vulnerability for our adoption cycles. Because I think most of you here have been exploited before. If not, I hope it doesn''t happen. When it happens, it''s like a big kick in the stomach and it feels horrible and you feel not safe. But we still continue to stand here because we see something in this revolution that is worth actually pursuing. And what I mean with that is like, I want to make sure that the backed actors don''t have too many layers of access and vulnerabilities in our process of engagement. When I look at like Amazon and I set up an account on there, it''s very simple. Why are we creating something that basically allows bad actors to actually intercept you in a confirmation process around your asset type, then actually take out those assets while you actually confirm that you''re transferring them to someone. So for us, it''s very important that we''re actually solving problems with each of those friction points that actually currently are not allowing our industry to grow. Just like I said, multi-step actions. Make that in one click. Schedules dynamics. So for example, Shopify or Venmo. If I actually purchase something and I already have my shipping address and everything already established because I did already a prior purchase. Why do I have to re-enter it again? The fact that I actually can just adopt based on my user profile that information and just have a one click purchase option. That should be built into our chain. It should be something that is actually fundamental. In addition to that, we have something called a safeguard. How do we actually ensure that my assets are being actually held safe so that I''m not exposing them to an exploit? How do I actually schedule recurring payments and subscriptions that are basically continuous so that I don''t have to set them up continuously so that I''m not trapped in an exploit that actually happened in Discord? Because there''s a new NFT drop that I really want to mint and I want to mint it really fast and therefore I lost all my assets. You know, I think I lost three NFTs on that. So easy to read addresses. I have plenty of friends and me included that basically, you know, I''m like how many times we have copy and pasted the wrong address? Or how many times did I actually have a friend who had a security vulnerability where they copy and paste an address? They had some Trojan in there that actually then replaced that address with a new address. They thought, hey, I just copy and paste it and instantly they lost their assets. And how do I actually create an onboarding and viral element into the chain where it''s easy for me to go viral and actually invite people into my DAP without actually like creating frictions that I have 5% of crypto users adopting my DAP? I want to actually have all the Web 2 users engaged with my applications without actually making them feel like they''re creating a vulnerability for themselves. So really what we''ve been focusing on is how do we solve key friction points within our ecosystem? And how do we bring it to life? And for me, it''s important that everyone that''s actually engaging in this protocol is engaging with a reward mechanism so that they actually know that their participation. If I''m a whale on a network, I want to actually be valued for my contribution of volume and engagement. If I have a DAP that actually is bringing massive value to the chain, I want to actually be valued. If I''m basically switching to a system, yeah, we''ll give you basically an onboarding grant through our ecosystem fund. But if you actually generate volume, I want you to be basically rewarded for that. So it''s really about the stakeholders being part of the whole DAP strategy from ground off, not just the foundation, not just the engineers. So that we actually have something that''s sustainable and resilient for the growth dynamics that are occurring. Because otherwise, we''re just competing with multiple layers out there. And I look at like, for example, Avalanche. How much revenue are they generating basically on their protocol? And how is that revenue actually sustain them as a foundation? And how does that actually work out long term? Are they going to sell their user base? Are they going to merge? Like what is the monetization strategy on their side? Is it just staking assets? Is it DeFi? Is it actually NFTs? Is it gaming? Is it real world asset wrapping? What does that mean? How is that solving a true problem? And how are those providers actually truly being rewarded for actually solving those problems within the network? So for me, it''s really about monetization from day one. Every action counts. Meaning that every action within the network is being rewarded continuously, transparent. So that it actually really goes back to why we''re doing this. Transparency. It''s on the ledger. That''s why Elon right now is basically saying, hey, let''s put all the government spending on blockchain. I agree. I want to know that. I want to run a real time freaking audit. I want Ernst & Young and all those guys to go bankrupt. Because what? They''re charging large fees to basically do an audit in a time where we basically can have a ledger system and instantly know in real time if you had steak but you''re claiming to be a vegetarian. I think that''s the future I want to live in. A future of truth that''s on chain. And if you want to utilize ZKs because you want to have some privacy, do that. That''s fine. But all of these solutions need to be combined in a way that''s actually relevant and sustainable. So when I''m talking about the distribution model of incentive, it''s really about like how we take the network fees, do you convert them actually into the incentive token, and then create actually rewards that distributed all the stakeholders. And who are the stakeholders is all the active wallets. Like why do an airdrop to actually inactive wallets that actually are just proxy wallets, what we''re seeing in basically Solana where you have snipers pushing it out to inactive wallets. And then they''re basically reintroducing those tokens back into the network. While it developers and app developers, I want to make sure that they actually be incentivized based on adoption flows. I want to make sure that network operators and node operators are actually being incentivized in the right way to actually have the right tools and reward system for them to become sustainable because they are key. And when I''m talking about planet Earth, it''s like, okay, even carbon tax credits, because I''m using electricity and we even have an allocation to make sure that we have an offset on what it takes for us to actually run all these nodes. Because it''s important that the purpose is very deep in regards of like how we actually integrate our model and think about, hey, where are we going to be 10 years from now if this truly scales into mass adoption? So what I''d like for you to do is actually check out our test net. You can come to our booth. It''s actually right back there. You can also inquire about our ecosystem fund and the grants that we have to onboard you as developers. And really actually test out that test net in regards of seeing actually how well it works, how easy it is to use. When what I love is that I actually see most of the passion that fuels me within all my team members. Their feedback is actually what actually gets me here on stage because they''re telling me that there''s something, they''re building something that''s changing our industry. And that they''re proud, not because they want to have a multi-billion dollar market cap. Maybe that happens. That''s actually more of like a secondary thing. Like an artist doesn''t think about like how much this art is going to sell for. They''re thinking about like how big of an impact this is going to have from a consensus perspective, from a new approach perspective. And when I hear that purpose driven feedback from my team members, that makes me proud. And so I would like love for you to actually meet some of them at our booth, even talk to me for us to actually show you how we''re changing the game of layer one. Because I think that layer one needs to be redefined. And that''s exactly what we''re doing with incentive. Thank you guys.

We''re talking structured products linked to digital asset indices. Ooh, they say. So Mark, you''re from ZeroCap. Give us a little bit, just before we get into actually what the product is and why this is so interesting for now. Tell us a little bit about your firm. Yeah, sure, man. Good morning. Thanks for having me. Yeah, my name is Mark Heriot. I''m the head of sales at ZeroCap in Australia. We''re a leading institutional platform for digital assets in Australia, regulated. We offer a range of services, OTC, market making. We have a custody offering. And we also have a derivatives desk, one of the biggest in Australia and actually in the region as well. So one of the most comprehensive. So do a bunch of stuff, but really excited today to be here with you guys and launching this product with Coindesk. Beautiful. So my name is Alan Campbell. I''m president of Coindesk Indices. We are in the business of developing indices and working with issuers to bring novel kind of investment products to market. And so we''re very fortunate to work with Mark on this. What is the product that we''re here to launch today? Yeah, sure. So we''re actually going to launch a series of structured products on the Coindesk Indices and more specifically the CD20. Yeah. The initial one is going to be a principle protected structure. One of the first of its kind. And, you know, it''s going to offer investors some partial principle protection, but also some upside to the performance of the CD20 index, which is like a broad based crypto index. Obviously, you guys have developed. Yeah. We think this is really exciting because as, you know, with Trumponomics and things like this, we have a lot of new entrants to the market. They''re going to want exposure to crypto, but they, you know, they might not want to bet the house. So this is like a gentle way for them to get involved and get broad based exposure whilst protecting some of their capital. Yeah. Do you guys know where the Coindesk 20 is? Not so much. Maybe. It''s the most traded digital asset index in the world. A total volume of about 13 and a half billion since we launched it a year ago. It trades mainly as a perpetual future on the bullish exchange. And it does approximately a billion dollars a month. So this is a very important and growing asset and piece of market structure for the industry. And so Mark and his team are thinking about how to bring this to life in a novel way. What does this product do? Like there''s clearly structured products, not new. What is the gap that you see? What is really the opportunity? And who are you targeting? Like who''s this for? Yeah, sure. So I think if you look at the traditional finance world, you know, equities, for example, if an investor say in Hong Kong was broad based tech exposure, they would look at like the Nasdaq or the triple Q ETF. Yeah. In crypto, we don''t really have anything like that up until now. So people would either buy Bitcoin, Ethereum, maybe they go Solana or they maybe go to the other end of the spectrum and go memes. Right. And it''s hard to get like build a basket that represents that sort of broader based exposure. So the CD20 is great at that. And what we''re now doing is using that CD20 underlying and then wrapping products around it. And the good thing about structured products, you can tailor the profiles of people''s investment outcomes. If they want something more conservative, they want some yield, they want some raciness, you know, with leverage, we can do all those kind of things. Yeah. So the great thing is the CD20 underpins it and then we can tweak the payoffs depending on what investor class we''re going after. Okay. You guys are engineers in a way. Volatility is a kind of key component of crypto. Is there any risk that we''re kind of over financializing, over engineering these products and kind of perhaps detracting from what is appealing to many people? Yeah, sure. I think historically we know crypto is quite a complex asset class and barriers to entry are quite high for like, you know, you got to run different pieces of software and things like this. Yeah. So I think historically running structured products and crypto was like difficulty squared and it''s probably not resonated that much until now. I think, however, with the introduction of the iBit, the spot ETF from BlackRock, you''re opening up this marketplace to an incumbent or legacy sector that''s never been there before. And a lot of these guys are used to these kind of products. So if we can give them something simple to fit in, shoehorn into that existing framework, I don''t think it''s over engineering. And I think over time you''re going to just see more and more of this as people get more familiar with crypto. They''re going to want to see familiar payoffs and structured products or ETFs or loans, collateralized loans, whatever it is. These are going to come to the market. So I think having a broad based index outside of Bitcoin and outside of, like they say, the tail of assets is going to be really helpful to express that. So just finally, we''re nearly at time. What how do you address a larger market? How do you cast the net even wider to beyond maybe it''s high net worth or maybe it''s family offices? Like what is the is it a catalyst? Is there going to be a moment where structured products, which these are super interesting and highly defined and structured products? How do you how do you get that bigger audience? Yeah, sure. I think Asia is a very structured dominate structure product dominated market that the volumes on derivatives outweigh spot in traditional assets by a multitude of factors. What we need is a bit more of the plumbing to come. A lot of the I speak to a lot of the private banks up here in Hong Kong. There is interest, but the frameworks and from a legal plumbing, you know, security, custody settlement, things not quite there. So I think as regulation becomes clearer and I think, you know, SFC are doing that up in Hong Kong. Yeah. SFC will do that in the US over this year. Hopefully that becomes more crystallized. Then now we''re open the pathway for these banks to get involved. And I think when the banks start getting involved, you''ll see the volumes and the demand for this stuff skyrocket. I would tend to agree with that. We''re going to call it here. If you have more interest to talk and hear more about structured products with Mark and any of the same at CoinDesk, we have a booth somewhere on this floor. Come and chat to this. Mark, thank you very much. Thanks for having me. Cheers. Thank you. Buddy.ISA Dank adesso. Hear. Goodbye. Stop playing hi, bleg kim.H xi.QUI NG.', 'So listen, this is an exciting one.
